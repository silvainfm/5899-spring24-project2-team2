1,good,True,positive,28164,"CFOs Boost Currency Protections, Extend Hedge Contracts as Strong Dollar Takes Toll. 

The dollar in recent quarters has surged against major international currencies as the Federal Reserve‚Äö√Ñ√¥s rate increases outpace those of other central banks, making higher-yielding dollar assets more attractive for investors. Changes to companies‚Äö√Ñ√¥ hedge contracts include covering larger amounts of earnings as well as longer durations beyond the usual 18 to 24 months. 

Midland, Mich.-based Dow recorded a significant jump in foreign currency contracts as well, from $5.3 billion at the end of December to $13.13 billion at the end of the third quarter.","Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark and Prologis are among the U.S. businesses that have added protection or lengthened hedges",KO,Food & Beverage,Non-Alcoholic Beverages,Coca-Cola Co,2023-05-04T23:39:33+00:00,2023-05-04,2023-05-04T23:39:33+00:00,[{'name': 'Tech'}],"Apple (AAPL) posted a better-than-expected March quarter after the bell Thursday, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty ‚Äî helping the market clear another one of the big four hurdles we laid out earlier this week. Shares gained more than 2% in after-hours trading. Revenue in Apple's fiscal second quarter of $94.84 billion dropped 3% year-over-year but beat expectations of $92.96 billion. Foreign exchange fluctuations were a headwind of over 500 basis points or more than 5 percentage points. Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52 were flat compared to a year ago, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43. Gross margin was 44.3%, expanding from a year ago and edging the 44.1% consensus estimate. Bottom line Apple bounced back nicely from the supply-constrained December quarter to deliver record March quarter results across a few key categories and metrics. The installed base of active devices continued to expand to more than 2 billion. New services and features are constantly being added ‚Äî including a recent buy now, pay later option and high-yield savings accounts ‚Äî providing fuel to an incredible ecosystem that garners unmatched loyalty and satisfaction from its customers. Wednesday evening's disappointing outlook on handset chipsets from Qualcomm (QCOM) sparked fears that global demand for mobile devices had been slipping even further. However, the Q2 results and outlook commentary a day later from Apple should ease some of those concerns, at least for now. ( We exited the Club's remaining small position in Qualcomm Thursday morning.) It's hard to tell if Apple's results were enough to send shares in the near term back to all-time highs of about $176 each, set back in August. But for now, we do know that two of the four market events we were concerned about have passed ‚Äî the Fed's latest interest rate hike and Apple's earnings. We reiterate that Apple should be owned, and not traded. The next question market for the market is Friday's employment report, followed by the June deadline on the debt ceiling. Cash flow Apple updated its generous shareholder return program Thursday evening. The board, as expected, authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion worth of stock and raised the quarterly dividend by a penny to 24 cents per share, marking the eleventh straight year of increases. Apple has a policy of being so-called net cash neutral over time, meaning that if the cash isn't used for acquisitions or organic growth investments, it's returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In its March quarter, Apple returned $23 billion via the repurchase of 129 million shares valued at $19.1 billion and $3.7 billion in dividends. Quarterly commentary It was another quarter of records for Apple. Sales of iPhones and Services as well as the installed base of active devices for all major product categories and geographic segments all grew to all-time highs. Driving the new March quarter iPhone record were sales of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, which people love for the long battery life and advanced camera. The Pro was called out as well. Mac results, though down 31% year over year, were in line with management expectations as the business faces difficult compares after last year's M1 chip rollout. But really, this is no different than what we are seeing in the personal computer industry. The iPad's revenue decline of nearly 13% was also in line with expectations. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was flat but posted a solid beat. Services, a high-margin business for Apple, reached a new all-time revenue record in March with records across the App Stores, Apple Music, iCloud, and payment services units. Services rose 5.5% from last year but just missed estimates. Apple now has more than 975 million paid subscriptions, up 150 million in the last 12 months, underscoring what Apple does best in terms of selling a quality smartphone or computing and attaching so many different valuable subscription services. By geography, a few things stick out to us. Americas was a surprise miss, with revenues falling 7.6% from last year. We can trace back one reason for the annual decline to the United States, where last year many U.S. carriers were aggressive with their promotional activity. As for the big beat and 2.8% gain in Europe, keep in mind that Apple lumps in sales from India into this bucket. Sales in India grew double digits year over year to a new quarterly record. Apple opened up two new stores there just a few weeks ago, and they're off to a great start, according to the company. India represents one of Apple's next big growth markets. But the company is also doing quite well with record quarterly results in many other emerging markets. Finally, it was notable to see Greater China post such a solid beat given some of the recent uncertainty surrounding consumer buying patterns following the reopening. One reason that might explain Apple's strength is market share gains, which CEO Tim Cook believed the iPhone achieved in the quarter. China sales, despite the beat, fell nearly 3% year over year. Guidance As has been the case since the start of the Covid pandemic, Apple refrained from providing specific revenue guidance. Instead, what management offers is more directional commentary. For the current June quarter, Apple expects year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter result, assuming no worsening macro outlook. Foreign exchange will still be a headwind but improving sequentially, with the team estimating a negative year-over-year impact of nearly 4 percentage points. Services revenue growth is expected to be similar to the March quarter with management calling out headwinds impacting areas like digital advertising and mobile gaming. Gross margins look like they have some upside, with management guiding to between 44% and 44.5% versus estimates of 43.82%. One trend working in Apple's favor is favorable component pricing, like in memory. Putting it all together, these comments appear to be more or less in line with expectations, with the market likely putting more emphasis on the margin upside than the possible annual decline in revenues.

The tech industry has had a wild week

Good news this week if you owned shares in the bird app before Friday, less so if you have money almost anywhere else in tech.

The industry took a beating after Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft reported poorer-than-expected earnings, wiping nearly $1 trillion off their collective market caps.

Wall Street showed particular disdain for Meta and the $10 billion the firm has lost this year trying to bring its virtual-reality moon shot, the metaverse, into being. Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, complained during the earnings call that ""there are just too many experimental bets versus proven bets on the core."" Zuckerberg's response: Be patient. But that, plus a revenue decline, sent Meta's shares tumbling 24%.

Wild and possibly hubristic bets aside, rivals reported weaker growth even in their core competencies. Microsoft and Amazon reported slower growth in their usually outperforming cloud divisions, with Amazon also warning of slower holiday sales. Google parent Alphabet's earnings miss confirmed a digital-ad slowdown and signaled future pain in the broader economy.

Twitter's stockholders will, on the other hand, be a little bit better off as Elon Musk's deal-slash-joke to buy the firm was finalized Thursday night. He inherits complex problems: revenue growth, balancing censorship with free speech, and product innovation among them. He's already fired the executives responsible for all three.

For more on Musk, check out why Twitter's top execs stand to make more than $50 million from being ousted ‚Äî and here's the latest on Big Tech's brutal earnings season.

The days of endless Big Tech perks are coming to an end

Amid a streak of disappointing financial results, inflation, and global turmoil, companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are looking to rein in runaway costs.

For years, Big Tech companies competed on pay and perks to lure workers in a tight labor market. And for some young Silicon Valley workers, it's all they've known. But now, endless hiring and allotments for employee travel, free food, and company swag are being replaced ‚Äî by budget cuts, new performance mandates, and even layoffs.

The rising stars of the entertainment industry

Hollywood is changing faster than ever. Corporate mergers have created enormous conglomerates. Major streamers are battling for subscribers. And technology continues to disrupt the way people find and watch TV and movies.

These changes demand fresh thinking and innovation from talented leaders. Insider has identified 26 standouts who are accomplishing all that and more at the biggest entertainment heavyweights ‚Äî Netflix, Disney's Lucasfilm, NBCUniversal ‚Äî as well as independent studios and production companies.

Check out the full list here.

There's something about LoveShackFancy that seems to inspire an all-consuming passion in its shoppers. Rebecca Hessel Cohen founded the brand in 2013, and since then it has cemented its place as a must-have for prep schoolers and Southern sorority sisters.

But as the company grew from trunk shows in the Hamptons to a bona fide fashion empire, Cohen's blind spots became glaring. While LoveShackFancy has recently made efforts to respond to criticisms around diversity, its old-school appeal to ""unabashed femininity"" still feels like a relic.

Here's what former staffers told us about the brand.

What happens to this chipmaker could change everything

On a tiny island off the coast of China, one company manufactures a product used across the globe for countless household items as varied as PCs and washing machines.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is the world's largest chipmaker. But if US-China tensions ‚Äî and China's standoff with Taiwan ‚Äî causes the company to go offline, experts warn the production of everything from cars to iPhones could screech to a halt.

One expert says, ""That would be the biggest impact we've seen to the global economy ‚Äî possibly ever.""

Here's what to know about this potential crisis.

""In the white-collar jobs I'd had, there was always an infinite pile of work to do, with no hard cutoff times. In the warehouse, when your shift ends, the entire loading dock could be backed up, and it's not your problem.""

The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.38%, or 120 points, and the Nasdaq was up 1.2%.

The consumer price index rose 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in May, with 12-month inflation also slowing to a 3% pace from 4%, marking the slowest pace of price pressures since March 2021.

While many still expect the Fed to resume rate hikes later this month, rate hikes beyond July will likely be thrown into further doubt should upcoming economic data signal a further slowdown in inflation.

If economic data in the months ahead including the Employment Cost Index on July 28, and the employment and inflation data that is released in August, slow at the pace that we have seen in the CPI data of the past couple of months, then ‚Äúthe July hike may prove to be the final move of the cycle,‚Äù Jefferies said in a note.

Big tech shook off its recent malaise, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) as Treasury yields fell sharply on bets that the Fed rate hikes are nearing an end.

Microsoft added more than 1% as the tech giant took another major step forward toward closing its $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) after a Federal judge rejected the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs request to delay the acquisition, citing a lack of evidence that the deal would lessen competition.

‚ÄúWith the injunction denied, Microsoft has a green light to close the deal before July 18,‚Äù Wedbush said in a note. Should the deal extend beyond July 18, then under the terms of the deal, Microsoft would have been on the hook to pay Activision $3B and be required to negotiate a new deal, Wedbush added.

PepsiCo and Delta set to get earnings season underway

PepsiCo and Delta report quarterly results on Thursday, lifting the curtain on the quarterly earnings season.

The government, which filed the ad tech lawsuit in January along with eight states, had argued that Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

""In the more than three years that it has been investigating Google's ad tech business, the United States has received more than two million documents from Google and taken over thirty depositions of Google witnesses,"" the company said in a court filing late Monday. ""Yet plaintiffs remain unable to find support for their claimed antitrust harms.""

Google argued that the case should be thrown out because the government had erred in defining the online advertising market and improperly excluded powerful competitors such as Facebook. It also said that the government's estimate of Google's ad exchange as having ""more than 50%"" of the market fell short of the 70% needed to allege market power.

The company also said the government was wrong to assert that Google's acquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld, both more than 10 years ago, harmed competition. Antitrust enforcers approved both transactions at the time.

Google urged a hearing to consider the motion to dismiss.

The case is being heard by U.S. Judge Leonie Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia.

The Justice Department's ad tech lawsuit follows a separate lawsuit filed in 2020, at the end of the Trump administration, that accused Google of violating antitrust law to maintain its dominance in search. That case goes to trial in September.

Comcast shares have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the year-to-date period (+36.7% vs. +24.1%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.



Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.



However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.

Shares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date (+19.5% vs. +11.3%). With a wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company's primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.



Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages. Linde reported strong second quarter earnings aided by higher pricing from its Americas segment.



However, increasing competition for new projects and developments in emerging markets is concerning. The firm is extremely vulnerable to uncertainty associated with the slowdown of economic growth, as this could hurt demand for its industrial gases.

Marsh & McLennan's shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the year-to-date period (+19.1% vs. +14.4%). The company is well-poised to grow on the back of acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses.



Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. Solid cash flows enable business investments. MMC had around $3.7 billion left under authorization as of Jun 30, 2023.



However, escalating operating costs might weigh on the margins. The metric jumped 6.1% y/y in 1H23. A debt-laden balance sheet is a concern. Its valuation remains stretched at the current level. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

‚Ä¢ That's according to Universum's annual rankings of the World's Most Attractive Employers.
‚Ä¢ Students selected five employers that they most want to work for these rankings.

Business students from around the world hope they can work at Apple.

That's according to the latest ranking from Universum, an employer branding expert. Universum published its annual rankings of the World's Most Attractive Employers, one of which focuses on where business students are highly interested in working.

Universum said that the rankings are based on the ""top nine and most significant graduate hiring countries for multinational employers: USA, China, Germany, UK, France, India, Italy, Brazil, Canada. To be considered, companies must be among the top 90% of brands listed in at least four of the nine countries."" Students were asked, ""Choose the five employers you most want to work for, your five Ideal Employers."" The business standing ranking was determined this year by almost 90,000 business students from across the world.

Tech companies Apple, Google, and Microsoft made up this year's top three spots in the business student ranking.

""Among the highest-scoring employers in the WMAE rankings, Apple was the biggest winner in 2022 ‚Äî and particularly so for business students, who pushed the brand from the No.3 spot to No.1,"" Kortney Kutsop, managing director for Universum Americas, said in a statement. ""The company's consumer privacy moves in 2022 were viewed favorably by young talent, and its recent strong financial performance ‚Äî even as some of Apple's competitors falter ‚Äî will likely sustain the employer brand's position into 2023.""

Apple also ranked third in the engineering and IT student rankings, suggesting that students from various fields see Apple as a top potential place to work.

Accounting and consulting giant Deloitte ranked sixth in this business student ranking; it also ranked No. 14 in the IT student ranking this year.

""We are honored to once again be recognized as a top employer by talent entering the workforce,"" Michele Parmelee, Deloitte Global deputy CEO and chief people and purpose officer, said in a statement. ""Deloitte remains committed to supporting and inspiring our people throughout their career journeys. By providing opportunities, resources, and an inclusive culture, we are enabling our people to continue making an impact for their clients and communities.""

L'Or√©al Group also ranked toward the top of the business student ranking.

""We are very honored to be ranked No. 5 for Business Students, standing out alongside the tech giants and the first European company in the ranking,"" Michael Kienle, global VP of talent acquisition at L'Or√©al Group, said in a statement.

""Our people-driven culture, which has always been our driving force, resonates with the aspirations of young people who want to grow and have a voice in an inclusive and entrepreneurial environment, while having an impact on society and the planet,"" Kienle continued. ""At L'Or√©al, everyone contributes to a common and unique experience, that of creating beauty that moves the world.""

The following are the 30 companies that made the top of the business student ranking and how each company's 2022 rank compares to their standing in 2021.

The night before, I‚Äôd saved an album to Spotify, but when I fumbled through the panels of the desktop app, I couldn‚Äôt find it. The menu was full of recommendations and recent plays ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt find ‚ÄúAlbums‚Äù anywhere in the list. There wasn‚Äôt even a clear way to navigate to it. I tried cycling between the Home and Your Library tabs, but nothing turned up an Albums button. The side panel showed playlists, and the album I wanted wasn‚Äôt in my recent listens. I could search for it if I remembered the album‚Äôs name, but I didn‚Äôt.

Eventually, I got there by tinkering with the window size and keeping an eye on the top menu bar, but I had spent whole minutes in interface purgatory, and the emotional damage was done. When I needed my Albums list, it wasn‚Äôt there.

To be clear, this is not all that big of a deal. As Kourtney Kardashian memorably put it, there‚Äôs people that are dying, and a few moments of interface confusion are not that important in the grand scheme of things. But my confused morning search is part of a much larger problem for Spotify. As the service has grown, it‚Äôs also sprawled. Spotify first carved out its niche by moving beyond albums and personal favorites, focusing instead on user-generated playlists and automated recommendations. Now, the company is using the same playbook to expand beyond music entirely ‚Äî and in the process, it‚Äôs making its lone flagship app harder and harder to use.

Spotify‚Äôs first step in this direction was getting into podcasting. In 2019, the company made the twin acquisitions of Gimlet (a beloved podcast studio) and Anchor (a beloved podcast creation tool). In the years since, it‚Äôs been doing everything it can to make the Spotify app a destination, building out the app‚Äôs podcast tools and gating off a growing number of Gimlet shows to make them only accessible through the Spotify app.

It‚Äôs unusual to jam podcasts in a music app like this. Apple has both the most popular podcasts app and a fledgling music service, but it keeps them separate because that‚Äôs what people expect. Amazon serves podcasts through its Amazon Music app, but the company is more focused on external distribution. Podcast fans that ditch the native iOS app usually do so in favor of a podcast-only service like Stitcher or Overcast. The only reason to bundle music and podcasts together is if, like Spotify, you‚Äôre a popular music app trying to leverage your way into the podcast business. For the vast majority of listeners, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense.

More recently, Spotify has set its sights on the $4 billion audiobook market. The company acquired audiobook platform Findaway last year and has begun referring to audiobooks as the ‚Äúthird leg‚Äù of its business, alongside music and podcasts. As of this month, you can browse a library of 300,000 different titles from within the Spotify app, similar to Apple Books and other ebook storefronts. But just like the podcast bundle, this is a weird place for most audiobook listeners to look for their next title. All the major audiobook platforms have standalone apps, and Spotify‚Äôs software innovations (personalized playlists, cross-device syncing) don‚Äôt apply to audiobooks. Even the basic commercial proposition ‚Äî paying a flat monthly fee instead of buying albums piecemeal ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt apply to the new market.

In both cases, there‚Äôs a business logic behind what Spotify is doing. There are only so many people who will pay $10 a month to stream music, so if the business is going to keep growing, it needs to find new things to sell. Rather than start from scratch in the podcast and audiobook business, Spotify decided to leverage the 433 million people using its music app, figuring that if even a fraction of them converted, it would kick-start the new ventures.

Like any asset, the Spotify app can be overleveraged ‚Äî and when the company starts chipping away at the core function of listening to music, it‚Äôs playing a dangerous game. As it happens, I‚Äôm a heavy consumer of podcasts and audiobooks, too, but the extra menu tabs haven‚Äôt done much to tempt me over. And judging by the company‚Äôs latest earnings, I‚Äôm not alone. The main effect is making the Spotify player harder to use and spending down any goodwill users feel toward the company.

For now, Spotify doesn‚Äôt have to fight for its place in the streaming music business. But with each new line of business, the app gets a little more cluttered ‚Äî and the company‚Äôs hold on the streaming market gets a little weaker.",Spotify keeps making it harder for me to listen to music,non-causal,,"['RV', 'APR']",[],[],"['AXP', 'RV', 'APR']",-0.9997462

Following a new state regulation, the Oregon Health Authority reviews business deals, like mergers and acquisitions, to examine potential impacts on cost, quality of care, equity and access to services. With five One Medical clinics in Oregon, the proposed Amazon deal falls under the state agency‚Äôs purview.

Amazon announced a $3.9 billion deal in July to acquire One Medical, a membership-based service that offers virtual care and in-person visits. The Oregon Health Authority began its 30-day preliminary review of the acquisition at the end of November. On Wednesday, the agency said it had approved the transaction, with some conditions.

The preliminary review found Amazon‚Äôs acquisition was not likely to substantially reduce access to affordable health care in Oregon, the health agency wrote in its report. That‚Äôs partly because patients have many other options to access similar types of services and because One Medical‚Äôs patients represent a small number of people accessing care in the state.

Amazon‚Äôs advanced supply chain and purchasing power could generate efficiencies and savings for One Medical, the agency continued, though it‚Äôs not guaranteed those savings would be passed on to consumers.

The health authority acknowledged there could be potential equity concerns if One Medical siphons off commercially insured patients with higher payment rates from clinics that serve patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare. That concern is mitigated by the provider‚Äôs ‚Äúsmall footprint‚Äù in Oregon, it continued.

Despite its approval, the agency is requiring Amazon and One Medical to consistently report information on the services they provide, the patients they serve, quality of care and any governance or organizational changes. Amazon and One Medical will have to submit reports every six months for five years.

The Oregon Health Authority will also conduct its own analysis for the first, second and fifth year after the deal is finalized to assess whether the health care providers have ‚Äúkept to their commitments‚Äù regarding cost, access and quality of care.

During the agency‚Äôs review, several groups and individuals submitted comments opposing the transaction and expressing concern about health care companies prioritizing profits over patients, the department wrote in its review.

SEIU Local 49, the chapter of the Service Employees International Union that represents some health care workers in Oregon and Southwest Washington, pointed to allegations regarding Amazon‚Äôs treatment of workers in other parts of its business.

Patient concerns, combined with Amazon‚Äôs focus on profit, have made the union ‚Äúconcerned this trend may worsen and ultimately impact the care received by the residents of our state,‚Äù SEIU wrote in its public comments. ‚ÄúIf the deal is to move forward, we believe the [Oregon Health] Authority should explore imposing strict conditions to safeguard Oregon workers and patients.‚Äù

Though it got the green light to move forward in Oregon, Amazon‚Äôs acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the proposed deal.

An Amazon spokesperson said ‚Äúwe continue to work cooperatively with OHA and the FTC in their reviews of this transaction.‚Äù","Oregon health agency approves Amazon, One Medical acquisition",non-causal,"FTC, OHA, SEIU",['US'],[],"['OHA', 'FTC', 'SEIU']","['OHA', 'SEIU', 'FTC', 'KR', 'US']",-0.99978226

More job cuts in the tech sector could follow in the weeks to come: Google and Amazon have recently instituted hiring slowdowns and freezes, according to the Washington Post, and Amazon is planning to lay off about 10,000 employees, the New York Times reports.

So this begs the question: Where will all of these workers go?

Masha Bucher believes that some of the people impacted by tech layoffs this year will go on to start their own successful companies ‚Äî so much so that she's willing to bet $2 million on it.

On Nov. 8, Day One Ventures, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm Bucher launched in 2018, announced ""Funded Not Fired,"" a program that aims to invest $100,000 into 20 new startups that each have at least one founder who has been recently laid off from a tech company.

""VC investors are sitting on billions of dollars, and now we have thousands of talented people in engineering, salespeople, support staff and other functions looking for new job opportunities ‚Äî so why not direct some of this money towards them?"" Bucher, who is also general partner at the firm, tells CNBC Make It.

The 33-year-old understands firsthand the fear and confusion that comes with getting let go ‚Äî she's been laid off twice during her career, the first time when she was just 19 years old. While she felt ""discouraged and embarrassed"" at the time, Bucher is ultimately grateful for the experience.

""Being laid off was the best thing that ever happened to me,"" she says, adding that it was a ""wake-up call"" for her to become a full-time entrepreneur.

Born and raised in rural Russia, Bucher spent the earlier part of her career at the helm of Nashi, a pro-government Russian youth movement backed by the Kremlin (she maintains that she has long avoided Russian funding and told the Wall Street Journal that her past with Nashi was ""another life"").

In 2014, Bucher immigrated to the U.S. and opened M&A PR studio, which has led publicity campaigns for clients including Houzz, HotelTonight and WeWork among other tech companies (the studio is still active, however, Bucher left it in 2018 to focus on building Day One Ventures).

Apple describes the new ‚Äúdigital narration‚Äù feature on its website as making ‚Äúthe creation of audiobooks more accessible to all,‚Äù by reducing ‚Äúthe cost and complexity‚Äù of producing them for authors and publishers.

The feature represents a big shift from the current audiobook model, which often involves authors narrating their own books in a process that can take weeks and cost thousands for a publisher. Digital narration has the potential to allow smaller publishers and authors to put out an audiobook at a much lower cost.

Apple‚Äôs website says the feature is initially only available for romance and fiction books, where it lists two available digital voices: Madison and Jackson. (Two more voices, Helena and Mitchell, are on the way for nonfiction books). The service is only available in English at present, and Apple is oddly specific about the genres of books its digital narrators are able to tackle. ‚ÄúPrimary category must be romance or fiction (literary, historical, and women‚Äôs fiction are eligible; mysteries and thrillers, and science fiction and fantasy are not currently supported),‚Äù its website reads.

If you search for ‚ÄúAI narration‚Äù in the Books app, you‚Äôll find a series of romance novels with a small notice saying they‚Äôre ‚ÄúNarrated by Apple Books.‚Äù It also lists the specific name of the artificial narrator used.

‚ÄúThis is an Apple Books audiobook narrated by a digital voice based on a human narrator,‚Äù reads each audiobook listing that uses the company‚Äôs digital narration service. Listings include a combination of free and paid audiobooks, and the artificial voices sound about as good as you‚Äôd expect ‚Äî perfectly intelligible, but with an unmistakably artificial edge that lacks the warmth of a human storyteller. Though that will likely improved as AI voice tech evolves.

According to The Guardian, which was first to report the new feature, Apple had intended to launch it in November, but delayed its release because Elon Musk‚Äôs chaotic acquisition of Twitter and layoffs at Meta were dominating news headlines at the time. Apple has reportedly been approaching independent publishers about narrating their books, offering to shoulder the production costs while paying out royalties to authors.

Apple‚Äôs website says that publishers and authors retain audiobook rights, and can put out other versions of the audiobook if they choose.

Apple‚Äôs approach to digital narration is the opposite of competitor Amazon‚Äôs, whose Audible rules explicitly state that submitted audiobooks ‚Äúmust be narrated by a human.‚Äù Notably, its Kindles used to offer a text-to-speech feature, but this was discontinued a decade ago after copyright concerns were raised. At least one AI-narrated audiobook has appeared on Amazon‚Äôs service in the past, according to this report from Wired, but it was removed after being reported.

In addition to Amazon, Spotify has also been investing in making audiobooks the third pillar of its streaming service alongside music and podcasts. But Spotify‚Äôs audiobook ambitions have mainly made headlines because of its clashes with Apple‚Äôs rules around in-app payments, which Spotify claims are ‚Äúchoking competition‚Äù and are ‚Äúanticompetitive.‚Äù",Apple Books quietly launches AI-narrated audiobooks,causal,AI,"['FDA', 'US']",[],['AI'],"['FDA', 'AI', 'ABG.BE', 'US']",-0.9997803

Why it matters: Amazon's wide-ranging moves mirror Elon Musk's attempt to transform tech, yet it remains unclear when the sum of its parts will let the e-commerce giant become a health juggernaut.

Driving the news: Last month, Amazon launched RxPass, a Prime service enabling members to get as many generic medications as they need for $5 a month.
‚Ä¢ This follows the launch of Amazon Clinic, a virtual service for common medical issues like allergies and hair loss, and Amazon's $3.9 billion acquisition of primary care clinic operator One Medical last year.

üì¶ Our thought bubble: Although Amazon's One Medical purchase is a BFD, its other announcements are less game-changing, at least in their current form. So let's make like a box and break it down, shall we?

Zoom in: Neither RxPass nor Amazon Clinic suggests the company is aimed at achieving two of health care's loftiest benchmarks: increased equity and accessibility.
‚Ä¢ Rather, they are mostly about expanding Amazon‚Äôs existing tentacles into providing care for relatively wealthy and economically secure populations.
‚Ä¢ RxPass enables 200 million people, or more than half the U.S. population, to get 30-day supplies of eligible generic prescriptions for $5. But it isn't available to Medicare and Medicaid populations, who are likely to need affordable medications most.
‚Ä¢ Also, the service includes only about 50 generic drugs, most of which are already relatively cheap. RxPass cannot be used for brand-name drugs, the world's most expensive medications, and the service is not currently available in all states.
‚Ä¢ Amazon Clinic is a cash-pay, virtual care business aimed at common ailments that largely affect the worried well, such as allergies and hair loss (similar to the services provided by companies such as Ro or Hims & Hers). Like RxPass, it cannot be paid for using Medicare or Medicaid.

Yes, but: In contrast to its virtual care and pharmacy activity, Amazon's purchase of One Medical enables the consumer-obsessed giant to outbid rivals in terms of geographic heft and get a toehold into lucrative risk-based Medicare programs, which remain untouched by the company's other efforts.
‚Ä¢ ""Access to Medicare Plans and employer groups is likely a key consideration that Amazon has with this deal,"" BTIG analysts David Larsen and Aron Corin wrote in a research note at the time of the announcement.
‚Ä¢ ""The sleeping giant in the deal may be One Medical‚Äôs Medicare Advantage business [Iora] because they can take on massive risk,"" CareCentrix CEO John Driscoll previously told Axios.

The unboxing: Amazon's health care efforts could be seen as a mix of bold and mediocre, but taken together, they could eventually be game-changing.
‚Ä¢ Remember: In addition to the plays above, Amazon has the Halo for fitness monitoring, the Alexa for voice-based commands, a diagnostics division, a powerful cloud presence with AWS, and a retail (or potential food-as-medicine) presence in Whole Foods.
‚Ä¢ ""Amazon‚Äôs customer-centric model has the potential to reinvent the patient experience by putting the patient at the center of their journey to drive value-based and quality care at every touchpoint,"" Forrester researchers Natalie Schibell and Kara Wilson and contributors Delilah Gonzalez and Peter Harrison wrote in a recent report.",Unboxing Amazon's health care play,non-causal,"AWS, BTIG, CEO, BFD",['MGM'],['MGM'],"['AWS', 'BFD', 'BTIG', 'CEO']","['AWS', 'BFD', 'BTIG', 'MGM', 'CZR', 'CEO']",-0.99524784

In keeping with today's holiday, we're talking about something spooky: what's going on inside Twitter. For starters, questions are swirling over who's leading the company as CEO ‚Äî apparently even Elon Musk isn't sure ‚Äî and why people are being asked to print out code.

And that's not to mention that employees are preparing for layoffs after Twitter leaders and VPs made lists of who to keep.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here.

1. Twitter employees expect layoffs to begin very soon. Late Friday, Twitter team leaders and VPs began stack ranking employees. By Saturday afternoon, they handed Elon Musk lists of employees ""to keep,"" two people said.
‚Ä¢ The process began on Musk's first official day as Twitter's owner, a day that left employees confused and unsure of their fate. Plus, there was confusion over who's actually running the company: Despite listing himself as CEO on internal company profiles, Musk said he has ""no idea who the CEO is.""
‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, several Twitter engineering teams met with Tesla engineers in meetings aimed at identifying ""top"" performers and ""who to cut, who to keep and what orgs are bad,"" one person said.
‚Ä¢ There is no exact percentage of employees to be cut, this person added, but layoffs are expected to be ""aggressive"" ‚Äî and workers expect them to begin soon. That's why many engineers and vice presidents worked through the weekend to try and keep their jobs, in an atmosphere likened to the ""Hunger Games.""

As Musk prepares ""aggressive"" cuts, who will be spared?

2. Tech companies like Amazon and Meta are in for a tough few months. After tech stocks were slammed amid dismal earnings reports, analysts are saying there are choppy waters ahead ‚Äî and only some firms are prepared.

3. Amazon slashed another division in an attempt to cut costs. On Friday, the company fired half of its Amp live radio division, notifying roughly 150 people they would need to take severance or find new jobs internally. What we know about the cuts.

4. Elon Musk fired Twitter execs ""for cause"" in a bid to avoid paying out tens of millions in severance. According to The Information, Musk dismissed the executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, to try to avoid payouts and unvested stock awards, suggesting he had justification for their termination. A look at what that means.

5. VCs are looking for alternatives to traditional social networks. For the first time in years, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are ""weak"" ‚Äî and investors told Insider they're eager to back the next big platform and take on existing giants. Here's what VCs are looking for.

6. Mark Zuckerberg wants to do what Google did with Android ‚Äî but he learned all the wrong lessons. Similar to Google, Zuckerberg's Meta is trying to wrangle control away from Apple, but experts say the project seems to miss one key ingredient that made Android a success: consumer demand. Why analysts are skeptical Meta can pull it off.

7. Meet a woman who quit her full-time tech job to become a creator and voice actor. After four years of working for Instagram's marketing team, Joy Ofodu left to pursue voice acting and content creation. She explains how she grew her following, and what she's learned.

8. These billionaires have seen their net worths drop the most this year. Among this year's biggest losers are those who've invested heavily in the metaverse (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg) and crypto (Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao). Here's who else has had their net worth battered this year.

9. Airbnb awarded 100 recipients $100,000 each to design out-of-this-world properties. The selected winners were given the funding to bring their ideas to life.

The people who most need to hold onto their salaries are vulnerable to job losses, while the highly compensated CEOs usually get to keep their positions.

As a white-collar recession emerged, as reflected by the layoffs announced by some of the world‚Äôs largest and most profitable companies, like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google and Goldman Sachs, the CEOs were left untouched.

Decisions made by the top executives, such as hiring too aggressively, and their lack of preparation for dealing with record-high inflation rates and rapidly rising costs, resulted in significant layoffs impacting workers who didn‚Äôt have a say in the running of the organization. Although they made mistakes, the CEOs and C-suite executives seemed immune from taking their fair share of blame and pain‚Äîuntil now.

The tides are turning as shareholders, activist hedge funds and corporate boards are taking action by cutting the pay of some of the top chief executives. Sundar Pichai (Alphabet), Tim Cook (Apple), Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan), David Solomon (Goldman Sachs), James Gorman (Morgan Stanley) and Pat Gelsinger (Intel) are all taking pay cuts. Despite the slap on the wrist, there won‚Äôt be a need to raise a GoFundMe page for these executives, as they‚Äôre still earning small fortunes in stock awards.

Google plans to cut senior executives‚Äô pay as part of a cost-cutting initiative, in addition to laying off 12,000 workers. In a town hall meeting with employees last week, Pichai announced executives at the senior-vice-president level and above would see a ‚Äúvery significant reduction in their annual bonus,‚Äù according to the Wall Street Journal. The CEO indicated that for these roles, compensation is linked to company performance. It is unclear how much Pichai‚Äôs pay will be reduced.

Barron‚Äôs reported in December that the chief executive was awarded a new equity package by Alphabet‚Äôs board, valued at around $210 million, which may depend upon the performance of the shares.

The company has been receiving pressure from activist investors, including Christopher Hohn, a U.K. billionaire, who wrote a letter to Alphabet asserting that its employees are paid too much compared to other tech giants and its bloated workforce needs to be cut down.

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Cook‚Äôs annual compensation target for 2023 is $49 million, down from around $84 million last year. This marks a more than 40% dock in pay for the chief executive.

In addition to reducing the total target, 75% of Cook‚Äôs vesting shares will be tied to the iPhone maker‚Äôs stock performance this year, instead of 50%, CNBC reported.

Cook yielded to resistance over his lush compensation package, as advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services expressed to Apple shareholders ‚Äúsignificant concerns regarding the design and magnitude.‚Äù Even though stockholders ended up approving his pay package‚Äî64.4% voting in support‚Äîthe billionaire CEO agreed that it should be scaled back.

Apple is one of the few tech giants that has not announced a recent downsizing.

JPMorgan is removing the ‚Äúspecial award‚Äù component of its CEO‚Äôs compensation this year. According to a recent regulatory filing, the investment bank‚Äôs chief executive will receive a $1.5 million base salary and bonus of $33 million‚Äîtotaling $34.5 million.

Last year, Dimon‚Äôs special award amounted to $50 million in additional compensation. After criticism from the bank‚Äôs board, the firm will not grant the CEO this special payment in 2023 and has ‚Äúcommitted to not grant any special awards to him in the future.‚Äù

In May, JPMorgan shareholders rejected an options bonus for the CEO, following his take-home pay of $84.4 million in 2021, MarketWatch reported.

Goldman Sachs‚Äô CEO will receive about 29% less pay after a challenging year, marked by fewer initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and deal-making. Global IPO activity fell 45% year-over-year, according to data from Ernst & Young.

The New York City-based bank saw its stock price drop by 10% and its net earnings plunge by $10.4 billion after a big year in 2021.

Solomon, also known as DJ D-Sol, will receive $25 million for his work in 2022, compared to $35 million in 2021, according to an SEC filing. His annual base salary remains at $2 million, plus $23 million in variable compensation. The pay cut marks the latest in a series of tough developments for Goldman, including a cover story in the Economist with a photo rebranding the bank as ‚ÄúGoldman Sags.‚Äù Last month, the investment bank announced it was laying off as many as 3,200 employees in its most considerable job reduction since the financial crisis.

Morgan Stanley cut its CEO‚Äôs compensation by 10%, from $35 million to $31.5 million, the bank said in a recent regulatory filing.

The investment bank‚Äôs compensation committee determined that Morgan Stanley‚Äôs performance for 2022 was not as strong as the prior year, in which it achieved record financial performance. Profit at the bank fell 27% to $11 billion in 2022, and net revenue dropped 10% to $53.7 billion.

In December, Morgan Stanley cut about 1,600 jobs amongst its global staff.

Intel‚Äôs CEO is taking a 25% pay cut just days after the semiconductor maker‚Äôs poor fourth-quarter results, reported the Wall Street Journal. Additionally, the company‚Äôs executive team will see their base pay reduced by 15%. Senior managers will get a 10% cut and mid-level managers will have their pay slashed by 5%. The firm is also reportedly trimming 401(k) matching for employees in half.

Intel has confirmed that it will cut over 500 jobs in its Santa Clara and Folsom, California locations.

The pay cuts could be a sign of things to come in the technology industry after a tough year in 2022, as companies look for new ways to improve the bottom line. Intel is also losing market share to its rivals. Advanced Micro Devices, another chip maker, on Tuesday reported an increase in sales, as gains in its data-center business offset weakness in PCs.","CEOs Of Apple, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan And Other Top Companies Are Taking Pay Cuts",non-causal,"CNBC, IPO, CEO, SEC, DJ","['GI', 'AI']","['AI', 'MDT']","['DJ', 'CNBC', 'IPO', 'CEO', 'SEC']","['DJ', 'CNBC', 'GI', 'IPO', 'CEO', 'AI', 'SEC', 'MDT']",0.5199521

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues in the third quarter is $6.7 billion, growing 34.9% from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs reported figure. In second-quarter 2022, revenues from Google Cloud were $6.3 billion, accounting for 9% of total revenues and a year-over-year growth of 35.6%.

Google‚Äôs cloud annual revenues quadrupled between 2019 and the end of last year. In addition to reflecting the rapid adoption‚Äîassisted by the pandemic‚Äîof cloud computing by the enterprise IT market, this impressive growth rate is generally attributed to the changes to the business made by its CEO since January 2019, Thomas Kurian.

One major change was the expansion of the Google Cloud ecosystem with a commitment to having a partner involved in every one of its deals. Co-selling with tens-of-thousands of partners helped Google Cloud grow its share of the worldwide cloud infrastructure services market from 7% in 2019 to 10% today, according to Synergy Research.

Two members of this ecosystem are joining forces. 66degrees, a Google Cloud Premier Partner, today announced its merger with Pandera Systems, creating the second largest pure-play Google Cloud services firm in North America by both employee count and professional services revenue. Sunstone Partners, a private equity firm, made an additional investment.

Matt Kestian, CEO of 66degrees said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe merger with Pandera greatly expands 66degrees‚Äô data and analytics capabilities‚Ä¶ Data and analytics are at the center of every business decision. Our clients are seeking to modernize their platforms and harness the value of their data to drive business performance. The combination of Pandera and 66degrees further supports our collective clients‚Äô digital transformation and our company mission.‚Äù

Building on its strengths in data and analytics (popularly referred to as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù) and in ‚Äúopenness,‚Äù I argued in 2017, will help Google in its uphill battle in this market. After all, it has unleashed, quite accidently, the data-centric transformation of the entire IT market and of the business world.

The Google Cloud team, with its partners, have managed to leverage Google‚Äôs ongoing investment in data centers around the world, its AI expertise, and its traditional ‚Äúcommunity development‚Äù work. The experience of working with many other developers has helped it define and advance a ‚Äúmulti-cloud‚Äù strategic differentiation.

BigQuery Omni, which is available not only on the Google Cloud but also for AWS and Microsoft Azure, is an example of successfully taking the data warehouse that has been the foundation of Google‚Äôs data and analytics leadership, and providing it to users to seamlessly analyze data across different cloud platforms.

‚ÄúDeveloping a large ecosystem or a dedicated community of followers is... in the ‚ÄòGoogle DNA‚Äô and will serve as an important weapon in the cloud wars,‚Äù I wrote five years ago. ‚ÄúThis was used to be called ‚Äòopenness‚Äô in the IT industry, but Google (and other companies of its generation) had taken it to a whole new level‚Ä¶ Transferring its IT expertise and data mining and machine learning knowledge to enterprise customers will finally make it less dependent on a slow-growing advertising market.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs continue with the documented record of my unsolicited advice to Google... In 2011, when Google was getting more than 90% of its revenues from advertising, I wrote: ‚ÄúIf Google will not take away some of Microsoft‚Äôs (and IBM‚Äôs, etc. for that matter) ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù revenues, someone else will. At stake are the $1.5 trillion spent annually by enterprises on hardware, software, and services. If you include what enterprises spend on IT internally (staff, etc.), you get at least $3 trillion. A big chunk of that will move to the cloud over the next fifteen years. Compare this $3 trillion to the $400 billion spent annually on all types of advertising worldwide. Why leave money on the table?‚Äù

SG&A expenses decreased 1.7% year on year to $298 million. The adjusted operating income was $399 million for the quarter, up 3% from $388 million in the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 11% compared with 11.1% in the prior-year quarter.

The Flexibles segment‚Äôs net sales increased 4% year over year to $2,812 million. This included an unfavorable currency impact of 6% and price increases of 7%. Adjusted operating profit was $353 million, marking a 5% increase from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs figure.



The Rigid Packaging segment‚Äôs net sales were $830 million in the quarter under review, 4% higher than the prior-year quarter. Price increase of 10% was offset by an unfavorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted EBIT increased 6% year over year to $57 million.

As of the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023, Amcor had $837 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $775 million at fiscal 2022-end. The company generated $145 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2023 compared with $323 million in the prior-year comparable period. AMCR reported an adjusted free cash outflow of $61 million in the first half of fiscal 2023 against an inflow of $105 million in the comparable period of the last year. As of Dec 31, 2022, Amcor‚Äôs net debt totaled $6.07 billion.



Amcor repurchased 3 million shares for $40 million in the first half of fiscal 2023. AMCR targeted total share repurchases of $500 million for fiscal 2023. 



In the first half of fiscal 2023, the company returned approximately $400 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. The company‚Äôs board of directors hiked the quarterly cash dividend to 12.25 cents per share from the previous payout of 12 cents per share.



AMCR completed the sale of its Russia business on Dec 23, 2022, and received cash proceeds of around $365 million. This was in addition to approximately $65 million of cash on hand in Russia, which was repatriated upon the closing of the deal. Approximately $120 million of the cash received is expected to be invested in a range of additional cost-saving initiatives. The company expects to use the remaining amount in repurchasing shares up to $100 million and to repay debt.



In January 2023, Amcor announced that it entered an agreement to acquire Shanghai-based MDK., which is a leading provider of flexible packaging for the medical device segment. MDK has an annual sales of approximately $50 million. MDK's coating capabilities, medical paper-based packaging products and customer base will complement Amcor's portfolio, while strengthening its leadership position in the China and broader Asia Pacific medical packaging segment. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Amcor expects adjusted comparable constant currency EPS growth of 3-8% for fiscal 2023. The guidance factors in an 5-10% expected growth from the underlying business performance and a 2% gain from share repurchases. This will be partly offset by a negative impact of 4% related to higher interest expenses and tax. A stronger dollar will impact earnings by 4%. AMCR also anticipates a negative impact of 3% associated with the sale of its three plants in Russia.

Adjusted EPS is expected to be 77-81 cents. The company projects an adjusted free cash flow of $1-$1.1 billion.

Over the past year, Amcor‚Äôs shares have gained 1% compared with the industry‚Äôs 1.3% growth.

Amcor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The United States' billionaires lost $660 billion collectively, the highest of any country by Forbes's count, as tech stock prices took a nosedive fueled by rising interest rates, soaring inflation and a worsening economy.

Of America's billionaires, Tesla, SpaceX, and newly minted Twitter CEO Elon Musk saw his fortune diminish the most. Musk's net worth dipped by about $115 billion this year, according to Forbes.

In October, when Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, he sold off about $23 billion in Tesla shares to fund the acquisition. He has since acknowledged this deal was an ""obvious"" overpayment. More recently, he confirmed his plans to step down as CEO of the social media platform once he finds a suitable replacement.

Tesla's stock price is down nearly 70% year-to-date, as of Dec. 27. Longtime Tesla investors are calling on its board of directors to get Musk to refocus on the electric vehicle company.

Although Musk lost his spot as the richest person in the world this year, he's still the wealthiest person in the United States, with a net worth of nearly $139 billion as of Dec. 27, according to Forbes.

And while Musk is ""the biggest loser of 2022,"" according to that publication, he's not the only billionaire whose net worth took a hit. Here's how much five other U.S. billionaires lost in 2022 according to Forbes.

Title: Founder and chair, Amazon

Estimated 2022 losses: -$80 billion

Net worth: $106.8 billion as of Dec. 27

Title: Co-founder and board member, Google

Estimated 2022 losses: -$40 billion

Net worth: $76.8 billion as of Dec. 27

Title: Chair emeritus , The Est√©e Lauder Companies

Estimated 2022 losses: -$9.8 billion

Net worth: $22 billion as of Dec. 27

Some high-profile moguls completely dropped off of the billionaires list in 2022. Rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, fell from the ranks after Adidas cut ties with him on Oct. 25 amid his continued anti-Semitic remarks, for example.

And Sam Bankman-Fried went from Fortune magazine cover star to potential felon. The founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform FTX, who is now charged with fraud, saw his net worth plummet by billions after FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11.

‚Ä¢ It has plans for another Pixel Watch for 2023 and a new Fitbit fitness tracker.
‚Ä¢ But sources say Fitbit's portfolio of devices may shrink in the long term.

Fitbit cofounder James Park took to the stage last week to formally introduce the Pixel Watch, marking the first major product born from Google's acquisition of his company. It was also a strong signal that Google was taking wearables seriously again.

Internally, Google is working on a second iteration of the Pixel Watch to launch in 2023, and many of the resources inside Google's wearables group are being directed to the second-generation device, according to three employees familiar with the roadmap. The company also plans to launch a new Fitbit fitness tracker next year, but no new Fitbit smartwatches, those people said.

Meanwhile, the company is exploring ways to integrate Fitbit's software platform across Google's range of hardware devices, which could provide more long-term subscription revenue. But there are doubts among employees that Google will keep the full Fitbit portfolio of devices that currently exists in the long term, as Google looks to streamline its product offerings and focus the company.

""The Pixel Watch is the highest priority right now,"" said one current employee. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on this story. Employees spoke to Insider on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak to the press.

Sources inside the company say Google is feeling the pressure to catch Apple, which has run away with the wearables market. The Cupertino-based company accounted for 30.3% of global wearable shipments in 2021, according to IDC data. Apple's smartwatch has become a staple of its annual hardware lineup, which now has three different models of the wearable all touting health-boosting and life-saving features.

Last week, Google unveiled a fresh range of consumer devices under its ""Pixel"" brand, including two smartphones and a tablet, all sporting a more cohesive look and undercutting Apple on prices. Google's smartwatch offers some of the same health and fitness features as Apple's, including an ECG reader and a GPS sensor, though it lacks some others.

The plan inside Google is to launch new iterations of the Pixel Watch alongside the company's Pixel phones each year, according to people familiar with the plan. The company is targeting an improved battery life for the second-generation Pixel Watch, one of those people said.

Google also plans to launch a cheaper Fitbit tracker, a successor to the Charge 5 tracker, in 2023. Employees who spoke with Insider said the company sees an opportunity in offering a cheaper device with a long battery life. ""They're arguably still the best sleep monitoring device available,"" an employee said of the current crop of Fitbit trackers. Insiders stressed that Google's plans were subject to change.

A cheaper fitness tracker would allow Google to target the lower-cost end of the market that may also pay for its premium Fitbit software service, which charges users $9.99 a month to access deeper insights into their health and sleep habits.

But some employees question whether Fitbit may also reduce its portfolio of hardware devices in the long term as Google focuses more on Pixel Watches and leans more heavily on the Fitbit brand for its software capabilities.

Fitbit, which recently launched the Versa 4 and Sense 2 smartwatches, has traditionally launched new smartwatches every other year, meaning the next iteration might be expected in 2024. However, employees who spoke to Insider said the Fitbit smartwatch line was currently not a priority, with the focus on making the Pixel Watch a success.

Two pointed to the fact that Fitbit had removed several notable features from its latest smartwatches, including support for third-party apps, and a feature that detected snoring, as a sign that the company was deprioritizing the higher-end Fitbit devices. A spokesperson declined to answer questions on why Fitbit had cut these features.

The Pixel Watch marks something of a reset in wearables for Google. The company entered the smartwatch space in 2014 with Wear OS, a software platform that third-party companies such as Huawei and LG could install on their devices, but its efforts lagged behind Apple, which launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and has since become the dominant player in the market.

Samsung, the second-largest smartwatch manufacturer, sells devices running Google's Wear OS. Much like its Pixel smartphones, the Pixel Watch offers Google some insurance against Samsung choosing to switch away from Wear OS, which could significantly reduce Google's presence in the market.

Acquiring Fitbit may also help shorten Apple's lead in health. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously said he believes health will be Apple's ""greatest contribution to mankind."" Google dismantled its own health program, Google Health, in 2021, and has struggled to form a cohesive vision in healthcare.

Internally, Google is positioning Fitbit as the health platform that will run through its ecosystem of devices, exploring integrations with products including its Nest smart home products. The company previously announced that it plans to make a sleep-tracking feature in its Nest smart home device exclusive to Fitbit Premium members in 2023.

The company is also exploring new health opportunities under Fitbit that may one day integrate into its devices, including a sleep apnea research project currently led by Fitbit cofounder Eric Friedman, according to a person familiar with the matter.

However, Google may also face long-term branding problems between its various hardware and software devices in the future, warned Creative Industries analyst Carolina Milanesi.

""It will be interesting to see what happens to Fitbit Premium going forward. We could maybe see a difference between an inclusive service for Pixel and an added subscription for the lower-priced trackers,"" she said. ""I struggle to see how it will remain a separate service for Pixel Watch to be honest, as from a brand perspective is not very clean.""",Inside Google's Plan to Take on the Apple Watch,non-causal,"IDC, OS, ECG, GPS, CEO, LG","['S', 'U']",[],"['OS', 'IDC', 'GPS', 'CEO', 'LG', 'ECG']","['OS', 'U', 'IDC', 'S', 'GPS', 'CEO', 'LG', 'AXP', 'ECG']",-0.074510746

Right-wing media watchdog The Righting reported that Truth Social drew just 2.85 million unique visitors in October, down from it peak of 4.02 million in August, citing Comscore data.

Notably, traffic dropped even as Google made the Truth Social app available for download in October, after blocking it for several months due to insufficient content moderation.

The user plummet coincided with the height of the midterms election campaign, which failed to produce the ‚Äúred wave‚Äù expected by many conservatives.

It was not just Truth Social that saw fewer users. Other conservative friendly social platforms also lost traffic, The Righting reported, with Rumble down 28% from a year ago to 6.59 million users, MeWe down 24% to 1.25 million users, Parler plunging 65% to 404,000 users and Gettr traffic dropping 61% to 294,000 users.

Parler‚Äôs traffic collapse came as Kanye ‚ÄúYe‚Äù West announced in mid-October that he would buy the ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù-driven social media platform from parent company Parlement Technologies.

In contrast, Elon Musk has claimed that new users are signing on to Twitter, which he took private in late October, at the rate of 2 million per day.

Earlier this month, Musk lifted the ban on Trump‚Äôs Twitter account that was put in place after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, but the former president has so far not shared his thoughts on his once-favorite platform.

Trump also has a contract with Truth Social that all of his social media posts must appear there first.

Adding fuel to the fire, Musk on Friday tweeted that he would support a 2024 Presidential bid by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, seen as Trump‚Äôs chief rival for the Republican nomination at this early stage of the race.

Truth Social was expected to be brought public by now by the special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp., but the move has been delayed multiple times. Last week, shareholders of the blank check company gave the social media company a nine-month extension for closing the deal, The New York Times reported.

Traffic has not only fallen on right-leaning social platforms, but also on conservative news websites, The Righting reported. FoxNews.com, with 73.76 million total visitors in October, saw a 21% year-over-year decline.

FoxNews.com draws about 10 times more visitors than the next most popular site, the Epoch Times, which was one of just two of the top 20 conservative sites The Righting tracked to report a traffic increase, with a 13% gain to 7.4 million visitors. The Washington Examiner, with a 29% gain, drew about 6.8 million visitors.

But the remaining names on the list all saw traffic declines, including a 36% tumble, at NewsMax, a 50% drop at the Daily Caller, a 71% plunge at RedState and a 79% falloff at CNS News.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The Justice Department and several states sued Google on Tuesday, alleging that its dominance in digital advertising harms competition.

The government alleges that Google‚Äôs plan to assert dominance has been to ‚Äúneutralize or eliminate‚Äù rivals through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors‚Äô products.

The antitrust suit was filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Attorney General Merrick Garland was expected to discuss it at a news conference later Tuesday.

The DOJ‚Äôs suit accuses Google of unlawfully monopolizing the way ads are served online by excluding competitors. This includes its 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick, a dominant ad server, and subsequent rollout of technology that locks in the split-second bidding process for ads that get served on Web pages.

The cuts will amount to roughly 250 layoffs, said a person familiar with the matter, from a workforce of roughly 45,000. The eliminations follow a separate round of layoffs in January, when Goldman eliminated 3,200 workers, and additional layoffs last September.

Waldron, speaking at a conference in New York on Thursday, cited a ""pretty difficult"" environment for Wall Street as a reason for the cuts, which will help with a previously stated goal of reducing $600 million from payroll. Trading revenue for Goldman may fall 25% in the second quarter.

""We're more cautious. We're running the firm tighter,"" he said.

Goldman is not the only Wall Street firm cutting back as deal-making dries up. The slowdown is largely due to a rapid rise in interest rates, economic uncertainty, and turmoil in the banking industry.

Most major banks that advise on mergers or IPO underwriting reported drops in fee revenue during the first quarter. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman Sachs (GS), followed by a 25% drop at Citigroup (C) and a 20% drop at Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw investment banking revenue down 19%.

Many of these banks decided to eliminate more positions this year, according to media reports. Cuts at Morgan Stanley (MS) will amount to roughly 3,000, and JPMorgan is culling roughly 500 positions. Citigroup and Bank of America are making smaller reductions of a few hundred jobs each.

Goldman is planning for a total of $1 billion in expense cuts, including the new layoffs.

""We're preparing for a tougher environment,"" Waldron said Thursday. ""We'd love to be surprised on the upside. We might be surprised on the upside. We can always flex into that but we definitely have a much more cautious tone.‚Äù

Waldron cited muted activity with private equity firms and less activity with larger companies while pointing to middle-market merger activity as a bright spot.

Trading ‚Äúis more sluggish,‚Äù said Waldron who added that compared to the second quarter a year ago, Goldman‚Äôs market division should post 25% lower revenue. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan executives have also warned recently that their trading results would decline in the second quarter.

‚ÄúWe've had a couple of good weeks of equity capital markets activity. So you could envision that we might have a better back half of the year. We're not necessarily planning for that, but it certainly could happen,‚Äù Waldron added.

When billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk first agreed in April to buy Twitter, many employees at the San Francisco social media company were leery of their new potential boss, who had criticized the company‚Äôs workforce as lazy and politically biased.

But they enjoyed the comfort of knowing they could always turn elsewhere. The job market for tech talent was strong and had only gotten stronger during the pandemic.

The tech sector has since taken a precipitous downturn, and employees of the social media giant are bracing for the worst: a potentially massive layoff of nearly three-fourths of the company. According to one recent report, Musk has told potential investors he plans to cut Twitter‚Äôs staff of roughly 7,500 employees to just over 2,000.

Earlier this week, a group of employees circulated an open letter preemptively protesting Musk‚Äôs move, Time magazine reported. ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs plan to lay off 75% of Twitter workers will hurt Twitter‚Äôs ability to serve the public conversation,‚Äù the letter said. ‚ÄúA threat of this magnitude is reckless, undermines our users‚Äô and customers‚Äô trust in our platform, and is a transparent act of worker intimidation.‚Äù

Recruiters have followed the news closely. Twitter announced it was freezing hiring in May as two top executives left the company, then laid off a third of its recruiting team. Employees have already been leaving in droves, Business Insider reported, fed up with the drama over Musk‚Äôs flashy takeover of the company.

‚ÄúAs an agency recruiter, if we get any whiff of unrest at a company, we‚Äôre definitely going out and trying to poach from them,‚Äù said Liz Schmidt, co-founder of EQ Recruiting. ‚ÄúWe already hit up everyone from Twitter who was a product manager or software engineer‚Äù a few months ago.

Schmidt said her firm received a handful of resumes at that time and plan to circle back on those profiles this week. Many employees are ‚Äúputting their toe in and maybe are waiting to see what happens, but aren‚Äôt going to start looking aggressively until they‚Äôre sure the layoffs are going through,‚Äù Schmidt said.

The 5,000 or so potentially laid-off employees face a cooling job market that has seen hiring freezes and layoffs at companies such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Google, Microsoft, Netflix and Snapchat. It‚Äôs a stark difference for an industry that boomed during the pandemic and competed to hire software engineers, offering lucrative compensation and job perks.

‚ÄúWith a lot of the massive and rapid hiring ... the last two years, we‚Äôve seen expectations for compensation, benefits, work culture, everything go through the roof,‚Äù said Andrew Esguerra, Los Angeles-area manager for recruiting agency Coda Search. ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt settling for any less than what they think is perfect.‚Äù

But for job-seekers in today‚Äôs climate, there has to be a ‚Äúnew set of expectations,‚Äù Esguerra said.

The scale of the expected layoff also means a large number of skilled workers will be leaving the company, as opposed to the workers that leave during a smaller reduction in staff.

‚ÄúA lot of times when I see a layoff of a smaller scale, it‚Äôs safe nine times out of 10 to assume those workers were deemed nonessential. ‚Ä¶ Usually you don‚Äôt lay off your best product managers and designers,‚Äù Esguerra said.

In this case, if an employee was in the top 50% of Twitter, ‚Äúit‚Äôs safe to assume they were good,‚Äù Esguerra said.

Brent Gilinsky, CEO of Hireful, said he‚Äôs experienced many layoffs at large companies since he entered the recruiting field in 2007. More than 1,400 current Twitter employees on LinkedIn have already indicated on their profiles that they are open to opportunities, he said.

‚ÄúI believe that ‚Ä¶ in general, it would be easy to place a Twitter employee,‚Äù Gilinsky said.

Though there are no legal requirements for severance pay, federal law stipulates employers must give at least 60 days‚Äô notice of a layoff if it affects more than a third of a company‚Äôs workforce.

Among Twitter employees ‚Äî or at least, those with publicly visible accounts on the platform they help run ‚Äî the mood this week has been a mix of exhaustion, resignation, measured optimism and gallows humor. Some made vague allusions to chaos or stress at work, while others reaffirmed their love for the company and their colleagues.

‚ÄúShout out to my co-workers for getting me through the week,‚Äù one employee posted.

Wrote another over the weekend: ‚ÄúAs a Twitter employee, this is probably one of the worst cases of the Sunday Scaries I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolute chaos aside, I love my team and what I get to do,‚Äù a third worker said.

The Musk-Twitter deal has been a seemingly endless series of offers, counteroffers, retractions, reversals and aborted plans. After backing out of his initial deal to buy the company for $44 billion earlier this year, Musk announced this month that he was resuming the acquisition, stalling a lawsuit against him in Delaware‚Äôs Court of Chancery.

A judge ordered him to complete the deal by Friday.

As things now near what may be some sort of actual conclusion, Musk has been taking to Twitter ‚Äî his platform of choice even before he made a bid to buy it ‚Äî to discuss his vision for the company‚Äôs future.

‚ÄúA beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism ‚Äî people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias,‚Äù he wrote in one tweet.

Another post found him trying to square two conflicting impulses at the root of Twitter‚Äôs business model: the need to cultivate an ecosystem that third-party advertisers (upon whom the site relies for the majority of its income) want to appear on, versus Musk‚Äôs frequently stated desire for the platform to be maximally hands-off when it comes to moderating users‚Äô posts.

‚ÄúThe reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated,‚Äù wrote Musk, who in the past has criticized the platform as overly censorious.

Yet at the same time, Musk continued, ‚ÄúTwitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!‚Äù

It‚Äôs a tricky balancing act ‚Äî one that‚Äôs tripped up many a social media exec before him ‚Äî which will probably remain top of mind for Musk during his tenure at the company‚Äôs helm.

Why it matters: One of the biggest benefits of the move is that each is now freed to focus on its own growth strategy, says a source familiar with the situation.
‚Ä¢ In the case of Alibaba, it also makes a split-up or spinoff of its units easier if it were to face further regulatory scrutiny.

Details: The new company holding structure is meant to mirror that of Alphabet, the parent of Google, the source notes.
‚Ä¢ With the review complete, no further moves are being contemplated at this time, the source says.
‚Ä¢ The source iterated that the businesses are now free to raise capital or to go public, as has been reported, or to seek partners or stand pat, among other options.

Be smart: The company announced the reorganization in March because it begins its fiscal year in April, CEO Daniel Zhang said during an investor call.
‚Ä¢ ""The management teams of the business groups will be working on planning and mapping out strategy, of course, not just for the coming year but for the coming years,"" he added.

Of note: Of the six businesses, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group will remain a wholly owned unit of Alibaba Group.

Flashback: After Alibaba founder Jack Ma publicly critiqued the Chinese government, both his e-commerce business and his fintech operation, Ant Group, came under intense regulatory scrutiny.
‚Ä¢ Ant Group's planned IPO for late 2020 was canceled and Alibaba was fined roughly $2.8 billion in 2021 for hindering competition.
‚Ä¢ In January the Chinese government took ""golden shares"" in Alibaba, with Ma ceding control.

Catch up fast: China strengthened its anti-monopoly law last year in part by increasing penalties.
‚Ä¢ More recently investors in the U.S. filed a lawsuit against Alibaba accusing the company of misleading them on merchant exclusivity.

Between the lines: We've seen tech companies in the U.S. such as Alphabet and Meta reorganize.
‚Ä¢ Tech conglomerates sooner or later face the conundrum of where to focus most of their attention and resources.
‚Ä¢ But Alibaba, by teasing the idea of IPOs for separate companies, raises the prospect of unlocking more value.

üí≠ Our thought bubble: Alibaba's breakup inspires questions about the value Amazon could unlock if it separated out its retail tech business.
‚Ä¢ Other retailers are loathed to do business with their biggest competitor, even though Amazon has offerings such as its Just Walk Out technology that are attractive.
‚Ä¢ And it would also make it easier for the divisions of these tech giants as separate companies to make acquisitions.

The runway of nearby Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey, Idaho will be clogged with private jets this week, with bigwigs like Disney‚Äôs Bob Iger and Meta‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg breaking out their shades, golf shirts and power vests ‚Äì or maybe a green, lizard-print, button-down, like Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett donned last year.

The conference‚Äôs private events each year are a closely-guarded secret, but the titans set to participate in closed-door dealmaking and hobnobbing may be more somber than usual as they stroll the grounds or grab a coffee.

Mergers and acquisitions ‚Äî the bread-and-butter draw of Sun Valley ‚Äî have dried up this year as companies face a still-uncertain outlook. While markets have bounced back from last year‚Äôs brutal selloff, tech giants like Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft are still smarting from massive layoffs as they slash spending and redouble their efforts on winning the artificial intelligence race.

In the media sector, industry mainstays like Iger, who just ordered major job cuts at Disney properties such as ESPN, and WarnerBros. Discovery‚Äôs David Zaslav, whose ratings-challenged network CNN is the subject of sale rumors, are under pressure to turn around their struggling empires.

In tech, Meta boss Zuckerberg is set to attend just days after his company launched its Twitter-like social media app Threads in a direct challenge to Elon Musk. Threads has already gained more than 100 million users ‚Äì as well as threats of legal action from Musk.

AI will surely be a key topic of discussion. OpenAI‚Äôs head honcho Sam Altman is slated to be in town for the gathering, as is Microsoft boss Satya Nadella, whose company has poured billions into the AI firm‚Äôs operations.

Apple CEO Tim Cook will be in town after steering the iPhone maker to an unprecedented $3 trillion market cap, as will Google boss Sundar Pichai, according to a guest list published by Variety last month.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick will be rubbing elbows even as he awaits word on whether a federal judge will side with the Federal Trade Commission in its bid to block the company‚Äôs sale to Microsoft for $69 billion. Tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman also made the cut.

From the media world, prominent figures such as Oprah Winfrey, New York Post and NewsCorp owner Rupert Murdoch and Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone were all invited to join Iger and Zaslav at the event.

Netflix execs Reed Hastings, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters are set to attend alongside Hollywood mainstays like CAA‚Äôs Bryan Lourd, newly minted Biden re-election campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, famed producer Brian Grazer and many others.

Sports leaders such as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred were tapped to attend.

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, whose recent tie-up with the Saudi-backed LIV circuit has drawn Congressional scrutiny over ‚Äúsportswashing‚Äù allegations, is also on the list. Monahan returned to work last week after a brief medical hiatus.

On the public policy front, ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former CIA head David Petraeus are among those who are said to have scored invitations.

Sun Valley is also set to play host to prominent journalists. Andrew Ross Sorkin, the New York Times‚Äô ‚ÄúDealBook‚Äù columnist and CNBC host, is expected to show up at the shindig, as is his ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù co-anchor Becky Quick.

CNN personality Van Jones is on the roster, alongside his network colleague Erin Burnett, The Free Press founder Bari Weiss and CBS journalists Gayle King and David Begnaud.

Musk, a featured speaker at last year‚Äôs festivities, was notably absent from the guest list. The Twitter owner‚Äôs appearance in Sun Valley last year came in the midst of his messy $44 billion Twitter takeover and just days after a report surfaced that he had fathered twins with Shivon Zilis, an executive at his brain chip company Neuralink.

Uneven demand ‚Äî though higher overall ‚Äî was driven by a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, airline and airport operational constraints, airline capacity limits, and regional travel restrictions, Sabre executives described during an earnings call on Wednesday.

The Texas-based company provides airfare distribution services along with operational software for airlines and the hotel sector.

The number of bookings in the fourth quarter took a hit, primarily in corporate travel and the Asia Pacific region, but those numbers seem to be returning to the recovery trajectory and getting stronger each week. Another hit: Sabre expects a headwind this year of about $100 million in IT solution revenue, primarily because of a new Russian law that forced the company to end those operations there.

Overall, any setbacks seem to have been one-time or temporary, said Kurt Ekert, president of Sabre. The company has calculated those into its projections and is continuing to move forward with other investments, ready for any other unexpected events over the next year.

‚ÄúAs we look at the balance of 2023, we are optimistic on overall demand and recovery levels moving forward, but prepared for the possibility of further unevenness in 2023,‚Äù Ekert said.

‚ÄúAccordingly, we will be responsive to changes in volume growth and control cost as needed to focus on achieving positive free cash flow this year. And while we will adjust as needed to external market conditions, we remain focused on the key long-term strategic opportunities for our business.‚Äù

Sabre counted 637 million passengers boarded in 2022, an increase of 30 percent from the previous year.

The company expects to complete this year with revenue between $2.8 billion and $3 billion. That number was $2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of 50 percent from 2021. Operating loss in 2022 was $261 million, versus $665 million in 2021.

Sabre is continuing its transition to Google Cloud, with a nearly full transition expected by the beginning of 2025. The company ended 2022 with approximately 66 percent of its total compute capacity in Google Cloud, expected to reach 90 percent by the end of this year.

The company exited all four of the datacenters it managed in Texas.

Development work for offloading the primary customer reservations database has been completed, and customer data migrations are on track to be completed this year. That work is in addition to the transfer work the company announced in November, including the full migration of SynXis software systems.

By the time the migration is complete, Sabre expects to have saved $150 million in computing costs.

‚ÄúWe continue to expect that by significantly reducing the complexity and increasing the agility of our technology architecture, we can better serve our customers at a significantly lower overall cost,‚Äù Ekert said.

Sabre expects the migration will enable it to expand product offerings, like airline retailing and merchandising, as well as the hospitality central reservation system and new products that came with the acquisition of Nuvola.

Ekert expects to see investments in those product offerings pay off in the years ahead.

Sabre on Tuesday announced a multi-year renewal of JetBlue‚Äôs contract to use Sabre‚Äôs passenger service system and global distribution system.

‚ÄúShould their proposed merger [with Spirit Airlines] be approved, we believe we are very well positioned to help JetBlue expand,‚Äù Ekert said.

In November, the company announced a partnership with Mastercard to accelerate the use of virtual cards for business-to-business travel payments.

‚ÄúThis announcement builds upon our acquisition of Conferma, which we acquired in August 2022, and furthers our strategy to create an open and independent travel payment ecosystem,‚Äù Ekert said.

The company is also continuing to build on recent partnerships made with BCD Travel, American Express Global Business Travel, and Hopper.

‚ÄúOur new agreements, and joint technology partnerships with GBT and BCD, are providing incremental bookings to Sabre‚Äôs network and are expected to continue to drive additional growth as migration continues, while also yielding opportunities to improve our customers‚Äô overall experience,‚Äù Ekert said.

It‚Äôs the latest sign that the U.S. government is not backing down from cases against tech firms even in light of a mixed record in court on antitrust suits.

This lawsuit, focused on Google‚Äôs online advertising business, seeks to make Google divest parts of the business and is the first against the company filed under the Biden administration. The Department‚Äôs earlier lawsuit, filed in October 2020 under the Trump administration, accused Google of using its alleged monopoly power to cut off competition for internet search through exclusionary agreements. That case is expected to go to trial in September.

Google also faces three other antitrust lawsuits from large groups of state attorneys general, including one focused on its advertising business led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia joined DOJ in the latest lawsuit.

Google‚Äôs advertising business has drawn critics because the platform operates on multiple sides of the market ‚Äî buying, selling and an ad exchange ‚Äî giving it unique insight into the process and potential leverage. The company has long denied that it dominates the online advertising market, pointing to the market share of competitors including Meta‚Äôs Facebook.

In its lawsuit, the Justice Department and the states argue that Google sought to control all sides of the market, realizing ‚Äúit could become ‚Äòthe be-all, and end-all location for all ad serving.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúGoogle would no longer have to compete on the merits; it could simply set the rules of the game to exclude rivals,‚Äù they allege.

They also claim Google acquired other companies, including its 2008 acquisition of publisher ad server DoubleClick and and a ‚Äúnascent ad exchange‚Äù that would become Google‚Äôs AdX, to grow its power in the market and ‚Äúset the stage for Google‚Äôs later exclusionary conduct across the ad tech industry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn effect, Google was robbing from Peter (the advertisers) to pay Paul (the publishers), all the while collecting a hefty transaction fee for its own privileged position in the middle,‚Äù the enforcers allege. ‚ÄúRather than helping to fund website publishing, Google was siphoning off advertising dollars for itself through the imposition of supra-competitive fees on its platforms. A rival publisher ad server could not compete with Google‚Äôs inflated ad prices, especially without access to Google‚Äôs captive advertiser demand from Google Ads.‚Äù

The DOJ Antitrust Division‚Äôs progressive chief, Jonathan Kanter, had recently been cleared to work on Google-related matters, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Bloomberg had previously reported that Kanter was not permitted to work on issues involving the company while the Department evaluated Google‚Äôs request to review his grounds for recusal. Before his time in government, Kanter represented some of Google‚Äôs rivals and critics, including Yelp and News Corp.

A Google spokesperson said in a statement last year that Kanter‚Äôs prior work and statements ‚Äúraise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial.‚Äù

Google is far from the only tech giant that has seen scrutiny from the federal government. At the Federal Trade Commission, Meta is also the subject of two antitrust suits, as is Microsoft‚Äôs proposed acquisition of Activision.

Google and other tech companies have also faced increasing scrutiny from abroad, particularly in Europe, where Google has also fought multiple competition cases and new regulations threaten major changes to tech business models.

Google did not immediately provide comment on the suit.

The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee was planned to question Kahn about the FTC‚Äôs investigation into Elon Musk‚Äôs operation of Twitter, focusing on whether the company is adequately protecting user data.

Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, has characterized the investigation as politically motivated and as harassment of Musk, and has subpoenaed the FTC for documents concerning the probe.

Khan is also expected to face questions about her agency's dealings with the larger technology industry. The hearing comes just two days after a federal judge dealt a blow to the FTC‚Äôs lawsuit to block Microsoft's (MSFT) $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

In an order responding to the FTC‚Äôs request for an injunction, the judge said the commission didn‚Äôt make its case to show that the deal should be stopped from closing while the suit proceeds.

The FTC has filed an appeal to the ruling with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre disappointed that the FTC is continuing to pursue what has become a demonstrably weak case, and we will oppose further efforts to delay the ability to move forward,‚Äù Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a statement.

That lawsuit is one of several high profile antitrust and consumer protection cases brought by the Kahn-led FTC.

In June, the FTC sued Amazon (AMZN) claiming that the way the company operates its Prime subscription service violates consumer protection laws.

In February, a federal judge ruled against the FTC in favor of Facebook parent company Meta (META) in the agency‚Äôs lawsuit to block the company from acquiring virtual reality company Within.

In a separate suit, a federal judge said the FTC could file an amended complaint to move forward with an antitrust lawsuit to force Meta to divest some of its companies.

The agency is also expected to file a complaint against Amazon alleging that Amazon.com favors third party sellers who use its Amazon Logistics services to ship and fulfill orders.

According to the committee‚Äôs website, the hearing is intended to ‚Äúexamine mismanagement of the FTC and its disregard for ethics and congressional oversight under Chair Lina Khan.‚Äù

The committee members said they will also examine the Commission's record of enforcement actions, and what it claims are ‚Äúpoliticized‚Äù FTC rule makings.

Ahead of the hearing, Big Tech industry group NetChoice issued a statement criticizing Khan and calling on Congress to restore accountability to the FTC.

""Chair Khan is frustrated because she is bound by American antitrust law, which requires her to use facts and evidence, rather than her own ideology about how the U.S. economy should operate,"" the group said in a statement

Khan, who was appointed as chair of the FTC at just 32 years old, made waves with her 2017 article for the Yale Law Journal titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.""

In the piece, Khan argues that the nation's current antitrust laws aren't capable of tackling the tech industry's anticompetitive behavior, and that they need to be rethought to bring Big Tech companies to heel.

Khan found support among both Democrats and Republicans during her confirmation hearing for the FTC, especially from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), herself a critic of Big Tech and member of the House Antitrust Committee.

The people who most need to hold onto their salaries are vulnerable to job losses, while the highly compensated CEOs usually get to keep their positions.

As a white-collar recession emerged, as reflected by the layoffs announced by some of the world‚Äôs largest and most profitable companies, like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google and Goldman Sachs, the CEOs were left untouched.

Decisions made by the top executives, such as hiring too aggressively, and their lack of preparation for dealing with record-high inflation rates and rapidly rising costs, resulted in significant layoffs impacting workers who didn‚Äôt have a say in the running of the organization. Although they made mistakes, the CEOs and C-suite executives seemed immune from taking their fair share of blame and pain‚Äîuntil now.

The tides are turning as shareholders, activist hedge funds and corporate boards are taking action by cutting the pay of some of the top chief executives. Sundar Pichai (Alphabet), Tim Cook (Apple), Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan), David Solomon (Goldman Sachs), James Gorman (Morgan Stanley) and Pat Gelsinger (Intel) are all taking pay cuts. Despite the slap on the wrist, there won‚Äôt be a need to raise a GoFundMe page for these executives, as they‚Äôre still earning small fortunes in stock awards.

Google plans to cut senior executives‚Äô pay as part of a cost-cutting initiative, in addition to laying off 12,000 workers. In a town hall meeting with employees last week, Pichai announced executives at the senior-vice-president level and above would see a ‚Äúvery significant reduction in their annual bonus,‚Äù according to the Wall Street Journal. The CEO indicated that for these roles, compensation is linked to company performance. It is unclear how much Pichai‚Äôs pay will be reduced.

Barron‚Äôs reported in December that the chief executive was awarded a new equity package by Alphabet‚Äôs board, valued at around $210 million, which may depend upon the performance of the shares.

The company has been receiving pressure from activist investors, including Christopher Hohn, a U.K. billionaire, who wrote a letter to Alphabet asserting that its employees are paid too much compared to other tech giants and its bloated workforce needs to be cut down.

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Cook‚Äôs annual compensation target for 2023 is $49 million, down from around $84 million last year. This marks a more than 40% dock in pay for the chief executive.

In addition to reducing the total target, 75% of Cook‚Äôs vesting shares will be tied to the iPhone maker‚Äôs stock performance this year, instead of 50%, CNBC reported.

Cook yielded to resistance over his lush compensation package, as advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services expressed to Apple shareholders ‚Äúsignificant concerns regarding the design and magnitude.‚Äù Even though stockholders ended up approving his pay package‚Äî64.4% voting in support‚Äîthe billionaire CEO agreed that it should be scaled back.

Apple is one of the few tech giants that has not announced a recent downsizing.

JPMorgan is removing the ‚Äúspecial award‚Äù component of its CEO‚Äôs compensation this year. According to a recent regulatory filing, the investment bank‚Äôs chief executive will receive a $1.5 million base salary and bonus of $33 million‚Äîtotaling $34.5 million.

Last year, Dimon‚Äôs special award amounted to $50 million in additional compensation. After criticism from the bank‚Äôs board, the firm will not grant the CEO this special payment in 2023 and has ‚Äúcommitted to not grant any special awards to him in the future.‚Äù

In May, JPMorgan shareholders rejected an options bonus for the CEO, following his take-home pay of $84.4 million in 2021, MarketWatch reported.

Goldman Sachs‚Äô CEO will receive about 29% less pay after a challenging year, marked by fewer initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and deal-making. Global IPO activity fell 45% year-over-year, according to data from Ernst & Young.

The New York City-based bank saw its stock price drop by 10% and its net earnings plunge by $10.4 billion after a big year in 2021.

Solomon, also known as DJ D-Sol, will receive $25 million for his work in 2022, compared to $35 million in 2021, according to an SEC filing. His annual base salary remains at $2 million, plus $23 million in variable compensation. The pay cut marks the latest in a series of tough developments for Goldman, including a cover story in the Economist with a photo rebranding the bank as ‚ÄúGoldman Sags.‚Äù Last month, the investment bank announced it was laying off as many as 3,200 employees in its most considerable job reduction since the financial crisis.

Morgan Stanley cut its CEO‚Äôs compensation by 10%, from $35 million to $31.5 million, the bank said in a recent regulatory filing.

The investment bank‚Äôs compensation committee determined that Morgan Stanley‚Äôs performance for 2022 was not as strong as the prior year, in which it achieved record financial performance. Profit at the bank fell 27% to $11 billion in 2022, and net revenue dropped 10% to $53.7 billion.

In December, Morgan Stanley cut about 1,600 jobs amongst its global staff.

Intel‚Äôs CEO is taking a 25% pay cut just days after the semiconductor maker‚Äôs poor fourth-quarter results, reported the Wall Street Journal. Additionally, the company‚Äôs executive team will see their base pay reduced by 15%. Senior managers will get a 10% cut and mid-level managers will have their pay slashed by 5%. The firm is also reportedly trimming 401(k) matching for employees in half.

Intel has confirmed that it will cut over 500 jobs in its Santa Clara and Folsom, California locations.

The pay cuts could be a sign of things to come in the technology industry after a tough year in 2022, as companies look for new ways to improve the bottom line. Intel is also losing market share to its rivals. Advanced Micro Devices, another chip maker, on Tuesday reported an increase in sales, as gains in its data-center business offset weakness in PCs.","CEOs Of Apple, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan And Other Top Companies Are Taking Pay Cuts",non-causal,"CNBC, IPO, CEO, SEC, DJ",[],['WSJ'],"['DJ', 'CNBC', 'IPO', 'CEO', 'SEC']","['DJ', 'CNBC', 'WSJ', 'IPO', 'WRK', 'CEO', 'SEC']",0.5199521

In specific market moves, shares of Coinbase (COIN) fell 2% before the open after the cryptocurrency exchange said it would cut nearly 1,000 jobs as part of a restructuring plan.

Oak Street Health (OSH) shares spiked 37% pre-market after Bloomberg News reported Monday that CVS Health is exploring an acquisition of the operator of primary care centers.

Tuesday's move come after a mixed start to the week that saw the technology-heavy Nasdaq extend gains from a rally Friday while the other two major averages failed to sustain momentum. The Nasdaq rose 0.6% on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Dow each closed down 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, following hawkish remarks from two Federal Reserve officials.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said during a live-streamed interview with the Wall Street Journal that she expects policymakers will raise interest rates to somewhere above 5%, while adding that the final rate will ultimately depend on the path of inflation.

Echoing that view, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic also said the U.S. central bank should raise interest rates above 5% by early in the second quarter and then hold them there for a ""long time.""

‚ÄúI am not a pivot guy,"" Bostic said in remarks at the Atlanta Rotary Club on Monday. ""I think we should pause and hold there, and let the policy work.""

Thursday will bring investors December‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‚Äì perhaps the most important economic release of the month and the last significant reading before Federal Reserve officials meet Jan. 31-Feb. 1 to deliver their next interest rate increase.

Economists expect headline CPI rose 6.6% over the prior year in December, a downshift from the 7.1% increase seen in November, according to data from Bloomberg. On a month-over-month basis, CPI likely stayed flat.

The report is likely to sway bets on whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 0.25% or 0.50% at the start of next month.

‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Schlumberger is passing draft notices on to some of its 9,000 Russian employees, Reuters reported. 

Schlumberger was co-operating with authorities by handing the notices to employees, and by failing to authorize remote work for its employees to help them escape the country, sources told Reuters. 

The BHRRC told Reuters that Roche and Novo Nordisk, two other non-Russian companies, had requested military exemptions for their employees.","Schlumberger is cooperating with Russian authorities by passing draft orders on to employees and won't authorize remote working,  Reuters reported.",SLB,Extractives & Minerals Processing,Oil & Gas - Services,Schlumberger Ltd,2022-11-06T13:10:15+00:00,2022-11-06,2022-11-06T13:10:15+00:00,[{'name': 'Business'}],"Whether from the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marines, vets don‚Äôt entertain notions like ‚Äúquiet quitting‚Äù (not going above and beyond the job description), walking out on a job before the mission is complete or leaving a difficult problem for someone else to solve.

‚ÄúThat kind of behavior is counterintuitive to everything that the military stands for,‚Äù said Alden Mills, an author and three-time Navy SEAL platoon commander. Mills now gives keynote speeches and advises CEOs and company board members on subjects like teamwork and leadership.

But not every veteran leaves the military and settles into their forever career right away. Take Hemanth ‚ÄúRay‚Äù Nalamothu, 33, for example. The Queens native served as an Army paratrooper in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Jordan from 2011 to 2018.

Upon leaving active service, he landed a prestigious job as the assistant to the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. But, after two years, Nalamothu decided a different path might be better. When he approached Amazon, which employs more than 45,000 military veterans and spouses, the company scooped him up.

‚ÄúThe leadership principles, unique perspectives in problem solving and ability to deliver results make [veterans] highly desirable recruits,‚Äù said Beau Higgins, a senior manager of military talent acquisition at Amazon. ‚ÄúThey also have a bias for action, one of our guiding principles.‚Äù

Nalamothu was assigned to Amazon‚Äôs JFK8, where he ran one of the largest fulfillment engines on Earth, all during the height of the global pandemic. He got the job done.

More recently, Nalamothu joined the 10-month Amazon technical apprenticeship, securing a full-time role as an associate cloud consultant at Amazon web services. He‚Äôll take that on when he completes his rotation as the chief of operations for the United States Army Corps of Engineers at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn.

While veterans have always had plenty to offer to employers, their experience and know-how is especially needed in uncertain times, said experts. ‚ÄúVeterans are not only diverse as a population, but they also bring with them a diversity of thought,‚Äù said Higgins. ‚ÄúThey just look at problems differently and are really good problem-solvers.‚Äù

Mills credits veterans‚Äô decision-making abilities for helping them stand out from the crowd. ‚ÄúAt a very young age, veterans are instilled with great responsibility and decision-making,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey learn to use what they have or become very resourceful in finding things they need to accomplish the mission/job.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs not just what vets bring to the workforce that matters ‚Äî it‚Äôs how they transform it as well.

‚ÄúThe entire US military is based on teamwork,‚Äù said Mills. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have a can-do, team-oriented mindset, you will not succeed. As a soldier, sailor, airman or marine, that can-do attitude can be infectious in any organization. Couple that mindset with their focus on looking on teamwork, and you will find veterans are a force multiplier in your workforce.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt have to tell that to corporate leaders like 38-year-old John Perez. He decided to join the military after he saw the World Trade towers come down just miles from his home in North Arlington, NJ. He was in high school at the time.

Perez joined the US Army shortly after, first via the Reserve Officers‚Äô Training Corps program at Seton Hall University in South Orange, NJ. He found a way to cram four years of college into three. Upon graduation, Perez was deployed to Iraq twice in four years before spending two years in the Army Reserves as a captain.

Perez has since climbed the ranks at Johnson & Johnson over the past 10 years, initially leveraging his experience in logistics. He now heads the department of military and veteran affairs, helping members of the military shift into the private sector.

‚ÄúThe military provides experience that you just can‚Äôt get in the private sector ‚Äî open ears, open eyes, coordinating and collaborating by default,‚Äù said Perez. These qualities are prized at Johnson & Johnson, where the executive chairman and most recent CEO, Alex Gorsky, is also an Army veteran.

Tamara ‚ÄúTam‚Äù Sonon, 42, a CUNY graduate, is a new recruit at Johnson & Johnson. She spent more than 20 years in the Navy, doing everything from managing finances and serving as an advisor to the United Nations in Mali to managing supply chains throughout the Pacific as well as Australia, Croatia and Egypt.

‚ÄúI loved every minute of my time in the Navy,‚Äù said Sonon. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt plan to stay long at first.‚Äù But as time went on, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd leave before I became an admiral.‚Äù

Yet with her husband also in the service and two young children, parental responsibilities prevailed. Even so, she finds her experience in the Navy to be of great use as the marketing lead for gastroenterology at Johnson & Johnson, a position she‚Äôs held for more than a year.

This transition is, in part, thanks to the GI Bill. ‚ÄúThe current military has a higher level of education than the current population,‚Äù said Perez. In fact, post-secondary education isn‚Äôt an anomaly among veterans.

‚ÄúThis is the most educated military in the history of the world,‚Äù said Mike Sarraille, the founder and CEO of management consulting and executive search firm Talent War Group. He spent two decades as a Recon Marine and Navy SEAL lieutenant commander in the elite Joint Special Operations Command.

Sarraille joined the military when the war on terror was raging in 2001. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt leave until I finished my job,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt ended up taking me 20 years, but in the military, we understand that our job is to make this place better than we found it, and if you‚Äôre working and doing the bare minimum, that can‚Äôt happen.‚Äù","If you want a job done well, hire a veteran",non-causal,"GI, US, NJ, CEO, SEAL, CUNY",['BHRRC'],[],"['NJ', 'CUNY', 'GI', 'CEO', 'SEAL', 'US']","['NJ', 'BHRRC', 'SLB', 'CUNY', 'GI', 'CEO', 'SEAL', 'US']",-0.99994075

With the Federal Reserve expected to approve another big interest-rate increase this week, finance chiefs are doing the math as they weigh alternative instruments to pay for maturing debt, mergers and acquisitions or other transactions. The Fed rate hike would be its fifth of the year, and bank financing costs usually respond more slowly than bond markets to these Fed actions, with a time lag ranging from several weeks to months, bankers said.

‚ÄúWe are seeing some resurgence in interest in term loans because it is a cheaper alternative for many borrowers,‚Äù said James Shepard, head of the investment-grade debt capital markets business at Mizuho Americas, an investment and corporate bank. He said the difference in funding costs can be as much as half a percentage point. ‚ÄúThese are companies that would have gone for regular bond financing when funding costs were low,‚Äù he added.

Companies including business-software firm Oracle Corp. , food maker Conagra Brands Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc., a manufacturer of cigarettes and vaping devices, in recent months secured financing via term loans.

Highly rated companies raised $998.8 billion in bonds in the U.S. this year through Monday, compared with $177.9 billion in term loans, according to Refinitiv, a data provider. For all of last year, fundraising through bonds amounted to $1.46 trillion versus $236.7 billion for term loans for investment-grade-rated companies.

‚ÄúIt is a small portion of companies that really have a capital need right now, as many of them tapped financing before,‚Äù said Don McCree, vice chairman and head of commercial banking at Citizens Financial Group Inc.

Banks often provide additional services to corporate customers‚Äîfor example cash management, hedging or underwriting‚Äîand therefore can charge less for term loans, he said. ‚ÄúAs long as there is ancillary business, the pricing in the bank market can be supported by other revenue streams,‚Äù Mr. McCree said.

Term loans often have a shorter duration than bonds, with many of them ranging from three to five years. Companies that agree to take out a loan don‚Äôt have to draw on it, which can make it more like insurance than a bond, where investors pay the company soon after the deal has closed. Revolving credit facilities differ from term loans insofar as the borrower can draw funds up to a limit, repay and redraw again. Under a term loan, the borrower usually makes a single draw of funds and commits to pay a fixed amount periodically.

Term loans and revolving credit facilities often have floating rates consisting of a fixed amount plus the secured overnight financing rate, which trades up or down depending on market conditions, while issuers usually agree to pay a fixed rate when they sell a bond.

Conagra, the investment-grade-rated owner of brands including Reddi-wip cream, Slim Jim meat sticks and Birds Eye frozen foods, earlier this month borrowed $500 million under a term loan that it put in place in August. The Chicago-based company said it plans to use some of the proceeds from the unsecured loan to repay longer-term debts maturing during its 2023 fiscal year.

Conagra has about $937 million coming due in bond debt in calendar year 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a data provider. The company, which had different financing options, said it chose a term loan due to the ‚Äúrelative strength of the bank loan market.‚Äù It last tapped the bond market in August 2021, S&P data show.

While highly rated companies have agreed to an average bond yield of 4% since the beginning of the year, that average yield has gone up to 4.8% for bond sales during the past three months, Citizens said. For bank loans including term loans, companies with a single-A credit rating on average agreed to pay a spread of SOFR plus 103 basis points since the beginning of the year. That average loan spread declined to SOFR plus 92 basis points during the past three months. SOFR traded at 2.27% on Monday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Austin, Texas-based Oracle, a regular issuer of bonds in previous years, in recent months also agreed to funding through investment-grade term loans, including $4.36 billion in July at a cost of 160 basis points plus SOFR, according to Refinitiv. The company has borrowed about $15 billion in term loans since the beginning of the year and skipped the bond market entirely. Oracle sold $14.9 billion in bonds in 2021, including about $2 billion maturing in 2028 for 2.3%, and $19.9 billion in 2020, including roughly $3.5 billion maturing in 2060 for $3.85%, according to Refinitiv. The company declined to comment.

Philip Morris, which in June agreed to $5.5 billion in term loans alongside a bridge facility to fund its offer for Swedish Match AB, a maker of lighter and tobacco products, also hasn‚Äôt been back to the bond market since 2020. The highly rated company declined to comment.

Bankers have also noted increased interest in term loans among noninvestment-grade-rated companies. Cheniere Energy Inc., a producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas, in June refinanced and upsized a $4 billion term loan and a $1.5 billion working capital facility. It hasn‚Äôt advertised bonds to investors this year as it did in 2021 and 2020, when it sold $750 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, according to Refinitiv. Cheniere, which is cutting debt to achieve an investment-grade credit rating, declined to comment.

But term loans can come with limitations. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. , a New York-listed cruise operator, last month placed $1.25 billion in bonds with a coupon rate of 11.625%, alongside a second offering of $1.15 billion at 6%. The company, which is working to reduce its debt to levels it had before Covid-19 and has a speculative-grade credit rating, uses term loans to finance its ships, but isn‚Äôt relying on such loans to tap funding to pay off maturities, Chief Financial Officer Naftali Holtz said. ‚ÄúThe long-term strategy is to get to an unsecured balance sheet. Term loans tend to be secured,‚Äù Mr. Holtz said, pointing to the mixture of bonds and term loans that make up the company‚Äôs capital structure.

Companies that have maturities in early 2023 and don‚Äôt want to wait to lock in financing can take out a term loan now, or enter into a hedge that allows them to sell bonds at a fixed rate.

‚ÄúIf credit markets reprice, they can exit the term loan and tap the bond market instead,‚Äù Mizuho‚Äôs Mr. Shepard said. ‚ÄúIt is cheap insurance, entering into a term loan now.‚Äù Still, companies would have to cover the transaction fee, which can vary, depending on the bank.",Loans Are Cheaper Than Bonds for Some Highly Rated Companies,causal,"AB, SOFR","['LNG', 'US', 'LFG']",[],"['AB', 'SOFR']","['US', 'SRE', 'SOFR', 'LNG', 'AB', 'LFG']",-0.9999025

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reported a plunge in fourth quarter profits on Tuesday, as Wall Street dealmakers handling mergers, acquisitions and initial public offerings faced a sharp drop in their businesses in 2022. Rising interest rates roiled markets last year and global investment banking revenue sank more than 50% from a year-earlier quarter, according to data from analytics firm Dealogic.

Banks are looking for a peak in the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hiking for confidence to return in boardrooms, along with a reduction in sharp swings in market prices.

""I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses (rate hikes), deal activity and underwriting activity will go up,"" said Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman on the bank's earnings call.

Morgan Stanley CFO Sharon Yeshaya said she was anticipating the pipeline of deals would be more active when there is a ""policy pivot of peaking inflation, something that allows the CEOs that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence.""

She said CEOs were also looking for ""price clarity and valuation certainty.""

The plunge in investment banking has led to deep job cuts, with Goldman Sachs letting go of more than 3,000 employees in its biggest round of job cuts since the 2008 financial crisis while Morgan Stanley has cut around 1,600. In total, global banks are in the process of cutting over 6,000 jobs.

""CEOs and boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near term,"" said Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon who said that there was an adjustment period for investment banking to return, as investors or CEOs re-adjust their views about valuations after slides in the market.

""It takes a period for people to adjust,"" Solomon said, adding his experience was ""4-6 quarters.""

Solomon also said that the first sign to look for would be in the investment grade debt market.

His expectations would be for the ""back half 2023"" to be ""meaningfully better,"" said Solomon, adding that he is heading to Davos where he saw commentary indicating that people were looking for a soft landing for the economy.

The World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos takes place this week. Two-thirds of private and public sector chief economists surveyed by the WEF expect a global recession this year.

Top bankers recently told Reuters that they see an M&A recovery in the second half of 2023. Big investors are sitting on piles of cash preparing to fund transactions, and large companies earning solid profits are looking to diversify their businesses, but they are waiting for economic uncertainty to fade.

If markets recover, Goldman's investment bankers stand to gain. The company has been the top global M&A adviser by revenue for the past 20 years, followed by JPMorgan, according to Dealogic data.

Across the board, investment banking fees were sharply lower.

Morgan Stanley's revenue from investment banking business fell 49% in the fourth quarter while Goldman Sachs's investment banking fees fell 48%.

JPMorgan's investment banking unit saw its revenue down 57%, Citigroup Inc's investment banking revenue plunged 58% while Bank of America Corp investment banking fees more than halved. Investment bank Jefferies Financial Group reported a 52.5% decline.

That fed into a poor quarter overall, which saw the six largest lenders, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs report profits ranging from up 6% to down 69%. Strength in trading helped offset a slump in investment banking, while interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve helped income.

On Wednesday, Goldman's shares fell 7.5%, although Morgan Stanley was up 6.7% as its earnings beat expectations on strength in its wealth business and trading.

Those six amassed a combined around $6 billion in reserves to prepare for soured loans, versus average projections $5.7 billion by Refinitiv. JPM set aside $1.4 billion, Wells Fargo $957 million, Bank of America $1.1 billion, Citi $640 million, Morgan Stanley increased its provision for credit losses to $87 million while Goldman Sachs provision for credit losses was $972 million.

1,no_event,False,positive,14264,"Credit-reporting firms face more U.S. scrutiny as complaints jump.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it found deficiencies in how credit-reporting companies including TransUnion, Equifax and Experian handle complaints about consumer data, as the agency explores new rules to rein in the industry.

Those three companies ‚Äö√Ñ√∫routinely top the list of complaints submitted by consumers,‚Äö√Ñ√π CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Tuesday announcing the agency‚Äö√Ñ√¥s annual report on credit and consumer-reporting complaints. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Policymakers and market participants can shape the future of collecting, using and sharing consumers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ data in a manner that navigates successfully from surveillance to participation.‚Äö√Ñ√π

The agency also offered recommendations for how the companies could improve their interactions with consumers, including by taking into account how automated processes might be an added burden. The industry should also acknowledge that flaws in consumer data could stem from the lack of individual autonomy over the information.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Enabling increased consumer participation on the data side of consumer reporting has the potential to create a fairer market with added benefits for consumers, consumer-reporting companies and lenders,‚Äö√Ñ√π the agency said in the statement.","The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it fielded approximately 488,000 complaints about credit-reporting companies from October 2021 to September 2022.",EFX,Services,Professional & Commercial Services,Equifax Inc,2023-02-13T11:41:21.099000+00:00,2023-02-13,2023-02-13T11:41:21.099000+00:00,[],"Companies large and small are on alert for a record wave of attacks this year from activist investors.

By the numbers: 2022 saw a record number of new activist investors, and a record share of activists' activity targeted large companies ‚Äî including Alphabet, Meta and Salesforce.

Driving the news: Last week, Trian Partners claimed victory over Disney in a proxy fight that showed what lies ahead in 2023.
‚Ä¢ Irenic Capital's attack on News Corp last fall captured two key activist trends in a single campaign: Irenic was a first-time activist, and it targeted a large, blue-chip industry name.

Details: Easing volatility and low valuations are keeping activists on center stage. And a drop in M&A volume is among the drivers for big-ticket activist campaigns.
‚Ä¢ 2022 saw a record number of new activist investors, with 55 first-timers representing 36% of all funds waging campaigns, according to Lazard. The prior record was 48 newcomers for 30% of campaigns in 2018.
‚Ä¢ The Lazard data also showed that large-cap companies accounted for a record share of activist targets (18%) in 2022.

What they're saying: ""The activists' play with large caps is, increasingly, break it up, divest, spin it off,"" said Evercore Managing Director Zach Oleksiuk. ""Activists are pushing for M&A opportunities where a buyer isn't needed.""
‚Ä¢ Whipsawing markets and tight financing prompted the M&A slowdown, and that meant CEOs were stuck if they wanted to sell or buy a division, or put the whole company on the block.
‚Ä¢ ""Volatility and valuations have come down, and that's created opportunities"" for activists, Oleksiuk said.

What we're watching: The seemingly ideal conditions for dissident shareholders are not lost on the dozens of funds that launched campaigns for the first time last year.
‚Ä¢ These include Mithril Capital's March campaign vs. Adagio Therapeutics, Mill Road's April campaign vs. Big Lots, and Pacific Point's January campaign vs. CH Robinson.
‚Ä¢ Lazard data show that the number of new, overall campaigns last year (235) rose 36% from 2021, nearly reaching 2018's record of 249.

""What had always held back the expansion of activism was boards who supported management teams come hell or high water. That's changing,"" says Jim Rossman, Barclays' global head of shareholder advisory.

The big picture: Another factor fueling activism is the growing support of other shareholders. The negative stigma that used to dog activists is fading, Rossman notes.
‚Ä¢ In addition, most companies today have a small number of institutional investors holding a significant amount of stock.
‚Ä¢ ""Activism has evolved from a market chasing trend,"" Rossman says.

Why it matters: It's the second major antitrust lawsuit filed against Google by the Justice Department in the last three years.
‚Ä¢ The DOJ and a coalition of state attorneys general sued Google in 2020 for allegedly using anticompetitive tactics to illegally monopolize the online search and search advertising markets. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Details: ""Competition in the ad tech space is broken, for reasons that were neither accidental nor inevitable,"" the filing reads. ""One industry behemoth, Google, has corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising.""
‚Ä¢ Bloomberg reported Monday that the lawsuit was imminent.

The big picture: Google is already under heavy antitrust scrutiny around the world, facing a search-related lawsuit from the Justice Department and anger from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about its practices and dominance.

By the numbers: Google earned $209 billion in ad revenue 2021, making it the largest advertising company in the world. By comparison, Meta ‚Äî the second-largest ad company globally ‚Äî made around $115 billion in ad revenue that same year.
‚Ä¢ The vast majority of Google's revenue (81% in 2021) comes from advertising.
‚Ä¢ Last year, Google's ad business took a hit thanks to economic headwinds impacting the growth of the global ad market.
‚Ä¢ The company will report its full-year earnings report next week. It's still expected to bring in more than $200 billion in ad revenue for the full year.

Catch up quick: Google's advertising dominance stems, in part, from a handful of ad tech acquisitions that regulators argue have given it a leg up on ad-serving over its competitors.
‚Ä¢ In 2007, it purchased DoubleClick ‚Äî an ad-serving company ‚Äî for $3.1 billion, giving it access to a vast online marketplace where Google could to sell display ads against the websites of thousands of online publishers.
‚Ä¢ In 2010, it acquired AdMob ‚Äî a mobile ad network ‚Äî for $750 million in stock, allowing Google to plant a flag in the quickly-growing mobile ad business that was spurred by the introduction of the iPhone.

Be smart: The lawsuit could meaningfully slow advances in Google's ad business at a time when it's starting to show signs of weakness thanks to the economy and growing competition from e-commerce companies like Amazon and streaming firms.
‚Ä¢ The company announced last week that it plans to lay off 12,000 workers to offset its rapid expansion during the pandemic.
‚Ä¢ The biggest proponents of antitrust action against Google's ad business have long been online publishers and smaller tech firms.

Flashback: Google has been hit with numerous antitrust penalties over the past five years in the U.S. and Europe, worth many billions of dollars. It has also paid hundreds of millions in data privacy settlements in the U.S.
‚Ä¢ 2017: European antitrust officials charged Google $2.7 billion fine for abusing its search practices, more than double what was expected.
‚Ä¢ 2018: European antitrust officials again charged Google ‚Ç¨4.1 billion for abusing the dominance of Android. The penalty was upheld, although slightly reduced, last year after Google tried to appeal the ruling.
‚Ä¢ 2020: The U.S. DOJ and state attorneys general sued Google over its search dominance.

For the first 12 months, Twitter will not take any cuts. ""That's 70 percent for subscriptions on iOS & Android (they charge 30 percent) and ~92 percent on web (could be better, depending on payment processor),"" Musk wrote in a Tweet.

‚Ä¢ InfiniBand (IB) and ethernet can both be used for AI computer networks.
‚Ä¢ Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology are set to take market share.

Despite recessionary fears or pessimistic forecasts for 2023's stock market, mega-tech stocks have had one of their best years.

As of Friday, the S&P 500 was up by 14% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq by 30% this year. Much of the gains have been carried by a small percentage of technology giants that benefited from the hype and development of artificial intelligence.

Stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) have already rallied to 198%, Meta (META) to 130%, Microsoft (MSFT) to 40%, and Google (GOOGL) to 37% for the year.

Some investors may feel they have missed their opportunity to bank on AI. But Bank of America expects the global AI software market to reach $900 billion by 2026, up from just under $600 billion this year.

The emergence of generative artificial intelligence, which creates new content or data, will accelerate demand for hardware in the next five years. But generative AI isn't like your average search engine. Developing the capacity for such a technology requires a heavy load of specialized hardware that can help speed up the machine learning process.

As big-tech cloud providers begin to integrate generative AI into their centers, the demand for things such as networking silicon is set to skyrocket. The total addressable market for silicon-based chips is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 40% to $10 billion by 2027, according to a June 21 note by Bank of America strategists led by Vivek Arya. That would be up from $2 billion in 2022.

The growing demand will allow new winners to join AI hardware provider NVDA.

For example, generative AI uses two types of communication technology in its computer networks: InfiniBand (IB) and ethernet. And while InfiniBand is currently leading demand, moving forward, the note reads that ethernet is expected to take the lead. Traditional ethernet has more use cases because it's already deployed for things like internet connectivity. It can also be used in the front- and back-end of AI servers. On the other hand, InfiniBand is only used in the back end.

The investment bank expects ethernet to attract most of the $10 billion market share, growing from $500 million to $6 billion by 2027. Demand for IB will also grow from $1.5 billion to $4 billion. IB made up 75% of 2022's $2 billion market.

So far, Nvidia (NVDA), through its 2019 acquisition of Mellanox, has had a head start by optimizing IB and becoming the only major provider of it. But as ethernet takes the lead, Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are expected to join the hardware giant, according to the note.","3 stocks set to lead a booming AI networking market that will grow 5x to $10 billion by 2027, according to Bank of America",non-causal,"IB, NVDA, MRVL, MSFT, AI, AVGO, META",['US'],['US'],"['IB', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'MRVL', 'AVGO', 'META', 'AI']","['IB', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'MRVL', 'CL', 'AVGO', 'META', 'AI', 'US']",-0.031549424

The study surveyed more than 520 HR professionals in the United States and the U.K. on burnout in the HR department. Ninety-eight percent of HR professionals self-reported that they were experiencing burnout, while 94% said they felt overwhelmed and 88% of respondents said they dreaded work.

As a result of workplace transformations, HR navigated in-office, remote and hybrid work styles. They contended with the Great Resignation, sourcing, recruiting, onboarding and retaining workers. The war for talent took its toll, as HR professionals felt undervalued and under-resourced.

Human resources professionals are, once again, experiencing stress and anxiety, but this time for a different reason. Instead of being exhausted from all the hiring, HR, talent acquisition and diversity, equity and inclusion professionals are on the chopping block. A pattern has emerged: recruiters and HR professionals are let go when companies lay off personnel and enact hiring freezes. If there isn't hiring, there is no need for this function. Relatedly, DEI teams are more quickly dismantled in the absence of a ""talent war,"" according to Bloomberg.

Recruiters are the canaries in the coal mines, as they know what will happen before anyone else. When the job market is blazing hot, headhunters are the rockstars held in high regard and relied upon to secure the best talent for their corporate clients. However, in recent months, the white-collar job market has been plagued with layoffs at several companies in various sectors.

In a challenging economic environment, the demand for recruiting services slows down. Once companies start letting go of recruiters, it's a sign that the firm will increase layoffs and enact hiring freezes.

While other areas within tech companies saw headcount reduced by 10% to 20%, companies downsized 50% of tech recruiters, according to the Wall Street Journal. This means that there are now fewer qualified headhunters actively recruiting. Protocol reported, ‚ÄúTech companies that have conducted layoffs this year eliminated around half of their HR and recruiting staffers,‚Äù according to a survey from interviewing.io. A year ago, tech companies couldn‚Äôt hire enough recruiters to fill all of the open technology positions. Now, the same recruiters have become job seekers.

Meta, Apple, Amazon And Twitter Let Go Of Talent Acquisition

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the social media giant is reducing its headcount. ‚ÄúRecruiting will be disproportionately affected since we‚Äôre planning to hire fewer people next year,‚Äù Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees. Around 1,500 recruiters and human resource professionals were slated for layoffs, as part of the 10,000 headcount reduction and the elimination of 5,000 open job requisitions roles.

Elon Musk took over Twitter and quickly cut 30% of its talent acquisition team. The layoffs came after the company announced that it would be pausing hiring to cut costs. Tesla, also run by Musk, laid off recruiters. The EV carmaker‚Äôs remaining employees complained about the increased workload and pressure to stay productive, Business Insider reported.

Home rental firm Airbnb eliminated 30% of its recruiting staff. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn laid off workers in its recruiting department. Recruiting software company Gem‚Äîwith over $100 million in funding and a $1.2 billion valuation‚Äî sent an email to 100 employees on the recruiting team, letting them know that they‚Äôre being let go.

Over the last number of years, tech companies aggressively hired to keep up with demand. Recruiters and HR were needed to keep the pipeline of hiring constantly moving. The situation dramatically changed when the economy was impacted by a one-two punch of runaway inflation and high interest rates that impacted the tech sector. Suddenly, hiring stopped, and the firings commenced. Many of these firms utilized contract recruiters that were not employed, but hired by third parties. It was easy to swiftly dispatch the contractors, as they didn‚Äôt have the same employment rights and protections as full-time, permanent employees.

Toward the end of last year, Apple downsized about 100 contract recruiters. Amazon commenced laying off contractor recruiters prior to its tens of thousands of corporate job cuts. Google-parent Alphabet exited external recruiters, as it slowed hiring, according to the Wall Street Journal.

As a sign of the fast-moving shift in hiring, last April, companies were advertising more than 10,000 openings for tech recruiters‚Äîtwice as much as the year before. By October, the number of tech-recruiter postings plummeted to around 2,500, according to ZipRecruiter.

With fewer new hires to recruit, cost-conscious organizations are also trimming budgets for workplace programs, including diversity, leadership training and well-being. HR and recruiting roles accounted for nearly 30% of all layoffs in tech, training provider 365 Data Science found. Postings for general HR jobs declined 23% over the past year, according to Textio, a workplace software service.

To keep up with demand over the last three years and the overall aggressive hiring across the board at tech companies, businesses hired one full-time HR employee for every 69 employees last year, compared to a historical norm of one to 100, according to workplace consultant Gartner.

1,bad,True,negative,5478,"Lawmakers bash Southwest over flight cancellations. 

Lawmakers are hammering Southwest Airlines over its spate of flight cancellations in recent days after a cold front blew in freezing temperatures and snow across broad swaths of the country during the holidays. 

While several airlines faced high levels of cancellations, Southwest canceled at least 70% of its flights Monday due to the weather and a reported system meltdown.

Southwest spokesperson Jay McVay Monday said the direction of the storm played a role in the airline having a disproportionate number of cancellations.

‚Ä¢ Searches for deleting accounts have now returned to pre-Musk levels.
‚Ä¢ But those relating to joining Twitter appear to be less common than before the acquisition.

Interest in joining Twitter has plunged in the six months since Elon Musk's takeover, according to Google Trends data compiled by the web-hosting company Fasthosts.

Google Trends' index for searches of ""Twitter sign up"" has plummeted 81% from a November peak, just weeks after the world's second-richest person took control of the social-media company.

Fasthosts' report adds that searches for how to delete accounts have now returned to pre-Musk levels, but those relating to joining Twitter appear to be less common than before the acquisition.

That could be because so many people have now joined Twitter ‚Äî as Musk has said usage is at an all-time high, and tweeted an internal report saying it had crossed 250 million daily users for the first time.

Although Fasthosts suggests it would be ""idealistic"" to say this is the only reason for the declining interest. ""Searches being as low as they are will not be the scenario those in charge were hoping for, a sign of potentially sluggish future growth,"" it said.

The search index for ""Twitter verification"" has also fallen a drastic 96% in the same period, as Musk introduced the controversial Twitter Blue subscription. It allows anybody to get the blue checkmark for $8 a month, while businesses are being asked to hand over $1,000 a month for a gold checkmark.

Last week, Musk told the BBC that Twitter's finances are now ""roughly breakeven"" after it was looking at a $3 billion negative cash flow for the year ‚Äì partly due to being saddled with debt from his takeover deal.

That fiscal improvement came after Musk laid off 80% of staff, landlords sued the company for alleged non-payment of rent, bathrooms were left without toilet paper, and furniture was auctioned off.

The reduced workforce has made the platform harder to keep online, with one outage happening because an employee accidentally deleted data and there was nobody left on the team responsible.

After a strong year of growth coming out of the pandemic, high inflation has taken its toll on the company‚Äôs financials.

From R.W. in Palmer, Alaska: What does the term ‚Äúpriced for perfection‚Äù mean?

The Fool responds: It‚Äôs often used when referring to a seemingly overvalued stock. It suggests that investors have high expectations for the company, and that their enthusiastic buying has pushed the share price up to a high valuation. It also suggests some riskiness, because if the company makes any mistakes or there‚Äôs some bad news, the stock could take a big hit.

You might avoid such a scenario by favoring ‚Äúvalue investing‚Äù ‚Äî seeking healthy, growing companies whose stocks are priced considerably below what you see as their intrinsic value. That builds in a margin of safety, which can reduce your risk if the share price drops.

From P.T. in South Kensington, Md.: Are stock dividends really taxed twice?

The Fool responds: Usually, yes. Here‚Äôs how: Imagine that Buzzy‚Äôs Broccoli Beer reports $120 million in sales. After subtracting various expenses, it keeps $30 million, which is subject to taxation.

With its post-tax profits, Buzzy‚Äôs might build a new factory, buy more advertising, hire more employees, repurchase some of its shares of stock and/or pay dividends to shareholders, among other things.

Any dividends that Buzzy‚Äôs pays out are generally considered taxable income for shareholders. That‚Äôs how dividends can get taxed twice ‚Äî first the company is taxed on its income, and then after it pays shareholders, they are typically taxed on those payments, too.

Some prefer companies to build more value for shareholders without paying out dividends. For instance, companies might repurchase some shares. Doing so reduces the share count, boosting each remaining share‚Äôs stake in the company ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt generate taxable income. (Repurchasing shares is wasteful, though, when a stock is overpriced.)

There are many scammers out there, and they love to target senior citizens. The FBI‚Äôs most recent Elder Fraud Report noted that in 2021, more than 92,000 victims over 60 years old reported losing $1.7 billion to fraud ‚Äî that‚Äôs 74% more than in 2020. Victims lost $18,246, on average, and 3,133 people lost more than $100,000.

Common senior scams involve Social Security. You might, for example, receive an alarming phone call, email or text suggesting that you‚Äôre in trouble. It might say that your Social Security benefits are about to be canceled unless you take certain actions ‚Äî now. You might be pressured to give out personal information, such as your Social Security number, birthdate and/or financial account numbers. The scammers might demand that you pay some money immediately.

Any of those things should serve as a big red flag. Know that the Social Security Administration will never call you out of the blue, or threaten that you must pay money immediately. If there‚Äôs ever an issue, the SSA is likely to send you a letter ‚Äî or it might email or text you if you have opted in for such communications. It usually requests payments via online bill pay or Pay.gov or in person at one of its many offices. If you‚Äôre ever in doubt, just contact the SSA directly and ask.

You can proactively prevent being targeted for a Social Security scam by signing up for a ‚Äúmy Social Security‚Äù account at SSA.gov. Everyone should do so, even if they‚Äôre far from retirement. Once you do, you can check in any time and see the SSA‚Äôs record of your earnings and estimates of your benefits. You can also update your contact information and manage your benefits online. If you haven‚Äôt set up such an account, a scammer might set one up for you, aiming to collect your benefits.

From S.O., online: My dumbest investment? Well, it was my first-ever stock investment ‚Äî a single share of Amazon.com that I bought for $303. I sold it three months later for $334 and thought I had made a good trade. Lesson learned: Play the long game!

The Fool responds: Looking at Amazon‚Äôs stock price now ‚Äî it was recently at $89 ‚Äî some might think that you dodged a bullet. But Amazon split its stock 20-for-1 in June. Shares were trading for around $2,450 pre-split, and if you owned one share then, you‚Äôd have ended up with 20 shares post-split, with each share worth around $122.50.

You probably bought your share long before the split, when the stock was on its way up to $2,450. Hindsight is 20/20, and it‚Äôs easy to regret selling the share, but if at the time you didn‚Äôt have confidence in Amazon‚Äôs potential to grow bigger, selling was the right move.

It can be tempting to sell a stock after it rises a bit and offers a profit, but always do a little research to see whether it seems likely to keep growing over many years.

Allied Pilots Association, which represents American‚Äôs 15,000 pilots, said a July deal between APA President Ed Sicher and American CEO Robert Isom contributed to the strong performance. The pair negotiated a letter of agreement awarding double time pay for holiday season flying.

Isom ‚Äúand President Sicher worked that out over the phone in July,‚Äù said APA spokesman Dennis Tajer. However, Tajer said, Isom‚Äôs effort to cap future pay increases is now a hindrance to a contract deal.

The double-time pay deal means that during the Thanksgiving holiday and for the approaching Christmas holiday, American‚Äôs pilot availability has improved. ‚ÄúWhen the bids came in for November and December, people who normally would avoid flying during the holiday season were bidding for it,‚Äù Tajer said.

‚ÄúThat creates a buffer of staffing that we never had before, created by incented flying,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs proof that outside the box ideas can lead to a more reliable airline. It worked, but we do have concerns that unless other scheduling practices are improved, Christmas travel may not be as reliable if it‚Äôs stress-tested by mother nature.‚Äù

Tajer said APA borrowed the concept from American regional carriers, where it has worked successfully.

The Delta Air Lines contract with the Air Line Pilots Association specifies that pilots will be paid double time for flying on their off days, including holidays. The United ALPA contract does not have a holiday premium pay rule, but the carrier can elect to pay overtime ‚Äî up to double time ‚Äî for any flight where it needs coverage

Regarding APA contract talks, Tajer said pilots have more proposals that would enable the strong performance to continue. One proposal would make more pilot instructors available, addressing the long delays in training. APA wants a 30% bonus for captains on scheduled flights to train new pilots. (The first officer scheduled for the flight would also be paid.) ‚ÄúWhat happens now is they have to take a check pilot away from the simulator,‚Äù Tajer said.

On November 2, APA said it had rejected a tentative agreement and recalled the negotiating committee that agreed to it. The 20-member board will advise the new negotiating team next week, enabling negotiations to resume soon afterwards.

A key issue in the recall was that while American has maintained that it wants its pilots to be the best paid in the industry, the negotiating team agreed to a proposal to impose a cap if other carriers‚Äô contracts come in higher than American‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIsom wants to sneak in a cost advantage,‚Äù Tajer said.

The rejected tentative agreement says that if, on the date of signing plus two years (DOS +2), Delta or United or both have provided increases in their respective pilot pay rates, then the American Airlines pilot pay rates will be compared and adjusted to the higher rate.

However, the TA says, ‚Äúthe wage adjustment shall not exceed three percent (3%) of the DOS +2 pay rates.‚Äù

As for holiday operations, David Seymour, American chief operating officer, commended employees for the carrier‚Äôs operational performance during the Thanksgiving travel period.

From Friday Nov. 16 through Sunday, Nov. 27, American reported its best Thanksgiving period completion factor since 2017 and its ‚Äúbest-ever controllable completion factor for the holiday period,‚Äù Seymour wrote in a letter to employees.

Completion factor during the 10-day period was 99.6%. Of the 50,000 flights during the 10 days, ‚ÄúWe had only 28 cancels due to controllable factors,‚Äù Seymour wrote. ‚ÄúIn fact, mainline had four consecutive zero-cancel days, which is the first time since the merger. And our regional operation saw one zero-cancel day.

‚ÄúWe have a lot to be a proud of, including an exceptionally strong Thanksgiving period operation that was more than 20% larger than that of our next major competitor,‚Äù he wrote, referring to Delta.

During the Thanksgiving holiday period, from Wednesday through Monday Nov. 28, Delta flew 2.79 passengers, surpassing its 2021 level by 7.2%. During the period, Delta completion factor was 99.9%. Only 13 flights cancelled, at both Delta and Delta Connection during the six-day period. On Monday, Delta had no cancellations.

United said it had its second-best on-time performance ever for the eight-day holiday travel period.

The 38-year-old Facebook founder has lost more than half his fortune - amounting to $76.8 billion - since September of last year, which led him to drop from number three to number 11 on the Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people.

Zuckerberg's net worth stands at $57.7 billion as of today.

In October 2021, Facebook officially became Meta as the tech mogul said at the time that his firm would massively invest in developing a portion of the metaverse - a digital realm accessed with augmented and virtual reality devices where people will one day work, shop and pursue leisure activities.

Meta's Reality Labs division lost $10 billion last year, the company announced earlier this year during its earnings call. The company, which has seen its stock price drop 38 percent in the last six months, has also faced increased government scrutiny on many fronts.

On June 28, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was blocking Meta's planned $400 million purchase of Within - which built a popular virtual reality fitness app called Supernatural - calling it an 'illegal acquisition.'

There's also a separate, still ongoing FTC antitrust investigation of Zuckerberg's company.

Meanwhile, Apple's privacy policy update last year made it much harder for firms like Meta to track users across the internet and apps - cutting into ad sales. The company reported its first ever quarterly revenue drop in July.

Meta is also seeing less interest in Instagram and Facebook, as younger users in particular flock to TikTok and newer apps like BeReal in droves. The company reported its first ever quarterly loss of daily active users in February.

Instagram faced an intense backlash in late July from celebrities and regular users who accused the company of copying TikTok in an effort to pivot more towards video sharing with Reels rather than traditional photographs and posts.

The platform was forced to backtrack on some of its proposed changes amid user discontent and a petition that pleaded with executives to 'Make Instagram Instagram Again.'

The Forbes 400 list is topped by Elon Musk, worth $251 billion, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $151 billion and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, worth $106 billion.

Musk, how is Tesla's CEO and SpaceX's founder, also cofounded the Boring Company and may end up owning Twitter, pending the outcome of litigation.

Software mogul Larry Ellison sits at number four with $101 million, just above investor Warren Buffet at $97 billion.

Alphabet co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who also saw their net worth drop, take the fourth and fifth spots. Ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer sits at number eight with a worth of $83 billion.

Other than Musk, the only other person in the top ten to see their fortune increase is Michael Bloomberg.

Jim Walton, the youngest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, rounds out the top ten with a worth of $57.9 billion.

Fiona Scott Morton, a former Obama administration anti-trust official, was appointed by the EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager last week, prompting strong criticism from French politicians including the foreign minister Catherine Colonna who urged the EU to ‚Äúreconsider‚Äù her appointment.

Vestager‚Äôs directorate is considered one of the most powerful in Brussels in relation to big US tech companies.

It recently charged Google with abusing its dominant position, warning it may have to sell part of its lucrative adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices.

At a summit in Brussels the French president said on Tuesday that he found arguments for Morton‚Äôs appointment ‚Äúdubious‚Äù.

Macron raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given consultancy work she had undertaken for a number of US tech companies in the past and questioned whether the EU needed to cross the Atlantic for the appointment.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there a European researcher who can do this job?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the conclusion we‚Äôre drawing, it‚Äôs extremely worrying, and we need to invest massively in the academic systems of our economies,‚Äù he added.

He claimed an equivalent appointment of a foreign national would be blocked in the US.

‚ÄúI would be open to seeing the USA recruit a European into the White House to be at the heart of White House decision, or the Chinese doing the same. I note, moreover, that the law would have prevented them from doing so,‚Äù he said.

Scott Morton will be both the first US national and first woman appointed to the job.

She currently holds a chair as professor of economics at the Yale School of Management and is affiliated with the University of Edinburgh. She is also a senior consultant to Charles River Associates, a consultancy which advises a number of tech giants.

She will play a key role in the EU competition enforcer‚Äôs investigations into Google, Apple, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, as well as high-profile mergers like Amazon‚Äôs acquisition of iRobot and Adobe‚Äôs Figma deal.

Macron said he had a ‚Äúlot of respect‚Äù for Scott Morton but said if she ever had to recuse herself from important decisions it would weaken her role.

‚ÄúIf she has to take a back seat, to distance herself from so many subjects? There you have it, all the questions I ask myself, which make me dubious about these issues,‚Äù said Macron.

Le Monde newspaper sharply criticised the appointment, describing it in an editorial as ‚Äúshocking‚Äù and ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù given the ‚Äúsensitive position in a directorate general where the notion of sovereignty is central‚Äù.

But French economist and Nobel prize winner Jean Tirole told Politico that the European Commission and ‚Äúmore broadly, us Europeans are very lucky to have drawn someone of her calibre‚Äù describing her as one of the ‚Äúbest economists in the world in the domain of industrial organisation‚Äù.

Macron has been at the forefront of initiatives in Europe to build ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù in the bloc‚Äôs economy, weakening its reliance on the US or China for defence and critical raw materials.

‚ÄúEuropeans need to develop European skills, to have strategic autonomy ‚Ä¶ and when I talk about strategic autonomy, you need to have autonomy of thought ‚Ä¶ You have to train minds, you have to use them and you have to recognise them ‚Ä¶ give them a role, draw consequences ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not really the most coherent decision,‚Äù he told reporters.","Appointment of American by EU directorate ‚Äòdubious‚Äô, says Macron",non-causal,"EU, US, USA","['NYSE', 'APD']",[],"['USA', 'EU', 'US']","['EU', 'NYSE', 'USA', 'APD', 'US']",-0.98858005

‚Ä¢ The Indian industrialist is the only one of the world's 10 wealthiest people to get richer in 2022.
‚Ä¢ Adani founded the Adani Group, which has interests in energy, mining, and ports.

Gautam Adani, the world's third-richest person, added $42 billion to his fortune this year even as other billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos saw their fortunes flail.

The Indian industrialist is now worth $119 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Adani is founder and chairman of the Adani Group, a multinational conglomerate with businesses spanning energy, mining, ports, and airports. It owns India's largest commercial port and has a controlling stake in Mumbai's international airport.

Adani began the year in 14th place on the rich list. Soaring energy prices and a string of acquisitions, including a port in Israel and a hostile takeover of Indian broadcaster NDTV, boosted his fortune, Bloomberg reported.

Adani was worth just $10 billion as recently as June 2020, but data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows he hit the $100 billion threshold in April, although he was worth $150 billion in September.

The only people richer than Adani are Bernard Arnault, the CEO of Louis Vuitton and Moet owner LVMH, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, according to the Bloomberg index. Arnault is worth $162 billion and Musk about $132 billion.

Adani is the only one of the world's 10 wealthiest people to get richer in 2022, per Bloomberg. Musk's wealth crashed by $138 billion, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos shed $87 billion, and Alphabet cofounder Larry Page slumped by $47 billion.

Adani is the richest Indian on the Bloomberg list, ahead of Mukesh Ambani, whose wealth is estimated at $86 billion. He controls Reliance Industries, another multinational conglomerate.

Adani was born in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat, in 1962. He dropped out of university after his second year studying commerce, according to Silicon India. He then turned to the diamond industry, first as a sorter and then as a trader in Mumbai, the publication reported.

After his brother purchased a plastic company, Adani started working with him and began importing PVC, per Bloomberg. In 1988, he set up Adani Enterprises.

The Adani Group comprises seven listed companies that have 23,000 staff and are worth $166 billion, though that is down from $242 billion in August.

Most of Adani's wealth is derived from the big shareholdings he has in his companies. According to Bloomberg, he holds 75% stakes in Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, and Adani Transmissions. Adani Enterprises' share price has more than doubled over the last year while Adani Power's tripled. Adani Enterprises had revenues of $9.6 billion in the six months to September.

A profile on the Adani Group website says Adani aims to make India a significant player in sustainable energy, and self-reliant in defence and security.

Adani said he and a companion were kidnapped in 1998 by a group of armed men. A police report said the kidnappers demanded a $2 million ransom and released the pair after the sum was paid, per The Indian Express. Eight people accused of the kidnapping were ultimately acquitted, Times Now India reported.

Adani was dining at the Taj Mahal Hotel during the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.

Its trajectory appears to mirror both the promise and the challenge of the current H.R. tech space: the huge potential for machine learning and data analytics to prompt smarter employee behavior and build better managers but also the crowded, competitive market currently exploding with artificial intelligence tools.

Now, amid growing consolidation of the H.R. tech market, Humu announced Wednesday it will be acquired by software firm Perceptyx, Forbes has learned exclusively.

The acquisition is aimed at helping Perceptyx‚Äîa platform with more than 600 customers that collects and organizes employee feedback via surveys‚Äîprovide employees and managers with customized, AI-prompted recommendations for how to act on that feedback. These behavior change ‚Äúnudges,‚Äù which appear in email, Slack or Microsoft Teams, might advise quieter employees to speak up in meetings if surveys find discussions are dominated by certain voices, or nudge managers to introduce new workers if feedback says new teammates need help integrating.

‚ÄúWhen Perceptyx approached us, we realized that by teaming up we could reach more people and organizations much more quickly,‚Äù Bock says, calling it an opportunity to ‚Äúchange how work feels for millions of people.‚Äù

Both companies declined to disclose the terms of the deal.

Humu‚Äôs technology adds a feature that customers have been asking for, Perceptyx CEO John Borland says, as pressure on chief human resources officers intensifies amid a changing labor market and hybrid work models. ‚ÄúThe expectation for organizations to leverage their people data in more meaningful ways has been rising,‚Äù Borland says. ‚ÄúThe need to be able to close the gap between signal and action is more important than ever.‚Äù

Despite an uncertain economy, H.R. technology is still an in-demand market with a lot of innovation, says Josh Bersin, a human resources industry analyst, especially as companies fret about manager deficiencies that grew during the pandemic and aim to get more out of employee performance. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been so much disruption in the workforce,‚Äù Bersin says. ‚ÄúCompanies are doing a lot of reskilling, and they‚Äôre really concerned about employee productivity and [still] spending a lot of money on employee experience.‚Äù

Perceptyx has made four other acquisitions over the past three years and has nearly $87 million in annual revenue, according to Kona Equity.

‚ÄúSurvey tools don‚Äôt really tell you what action to take as a result of the information you got back,‚Äù Bersin says. The integration could allow Perceptyx to differentiate itself in the market, he says, as H.R. departments try to turn survey results into behavior change and ‚Äúeverybody wants to figure out how to use AI in H.R.‚Äù

Bersin says Humu has been part of a crowded marketplace and ‚Äúwas a little ahead of its time,‚Äù launching ‚Äúat a time when most companies were just barely getting their general surveys working, so they didn‚Äôt have the spectacular success they were hoping to have.‚Äù The acquisition means Humu is ‚Äúbolted onto a more traditional solution that has the potential to add a lot more value,‚Äù adding it could put Humu in front of more customers.

Bock says feedback from customers was ‚Äúenthusiastic,‚Äù and that ‚Äúwith our early customers, we realized that to reach [Humu‚Äôs] full potential, we knew it needed to be connected to employee feedback in order to ‚Äòknow‚Äô who and what to nudge on.‚Äù While the startup tried to build its own survey engine, he says, they ‚Äúultimately decided to partner with an industry leader, which I‚Äôm confident is the right decision.‚Äù

Analysts say consolidation is common in the H.R. technology industry right now, as H.R. departments remain conservative with their budgets, causing companies to look for fewer vendors that offer more services.

As a result, employee experience platforms ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to be a dead-end platform that just delivers the insights,‚Äù says Betsy Summers, an H.R. tech analyst at Forrester. ‚ÄúThey also want to be involved in the action [because] if you can do that all in your platform, you‚Äôre incredibly sticky.‚Äù

Bock‚Äôs next act, meanwhile, takes him further afield from the H.R. world, which made him a star after years as the former head of people operations at Google, where he led teams whose generous perks and data-driven ‚Äúpeople analytics‚Äù were followed across corporate America. Instead, he‚Äôs moving on to cofounding a second company, Gretel.ai, a platform that tests AI models and generates datasets for developers. ‚ÄúIncreasingly the trend is for companies to start building their own kind of versions [of AI models],‚Äù Bock says.

‚Ä¢ Roku said last week it plans to cut around 200 jobs, representing roughly 5% of its workforce.

Between the lines: Digital upstarts are particularly vulnerable to ad slowdowns, because contracts for digital ads are typically much easier to pull at the last minute than contracts for television ads.
‚Ä¢ Protocol, the tech news website launched from Politico in 2020, will shut down by the end of the year, according to a company-wide memo obtained by Axios. Around 60 employees will be laid off.

The Chicago-based developer is proposing to annex the property to Deerfield and rezone the site for industrial and recreational use. Their intent is to then demolish all existing structures and redevelop the property as a state-of-the-art business park, according to documents on the Village of Deerfield's website. For those signing the petition at Change.org, the key issue with this proposal is the potential of ""an estimated 600 semi-trucks per day congesting the streets of Saunders, Lake Cook and Deerfield roads."" The petition, which was up to 1,717 signatures Friday morning, was started by Jamie Mintzias.

In a letter to the Village answering questions about the project, Bridge said it anticipates truck traffic to be a mix of different vehicles, but also believes it will be primarily semi-trucks. It anticipates peak traffic on weekdays will be between 7:45 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. in the morning, and 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. at night. The company said weekend traffic will ""generally be lower"" during the aforementioned hours. The petition also notes the industrial complex would be across the street from the largest residential community in Riverwoods, the Thorngate subdivision.



""The same stop light on Saunders Road would control truck and car traffic for both the industrial and residential areas,"" the petition reads. ""Congestion, noise, and pollution would span beyond Riverwoods into neighboring communities."" The Deerfield Plan Commission is holding a public hearing regarding the project at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, April 27, at Deerfield Village Hall, 850 Waukegan Road. According to the agenda for the meeting, Bridge's three-building plan for the property includes:
‚Ä¢ a 156,600-square-foot recreational facility with a full size indoor soccer field, an indoor youth baseball field and six outdoor pickleball courts According to a memo from Bridge included in the agenda, the two industrial buildings would be able to accommodate a variety of uses including warehouse, distribution, assembly, and light manufacturing. The recreational facility would be designed in a way that it could be converted to industrial use in the future if needed. Bridge also notes the Deerfield Park District has expressed a ""high level of interest in leasing the recreational facility.""

""The three buildings they are proposing will be as big as the Amazon warehouse that you drive by in Kenosha, but right here in our backyard, Deerfield,"" reads the petition. Patch has reached out to Bridge about the petition and the project. While details regarding the purchase price of the Baxter property have not been released publically, Crain's Chicago Business reported in January that the deal for the 645,688-square-foot-headquarters would be in the neighborhood of $90 and $100 million. Bridge, founded in 2000, describes itself on its website as a ""vertically integrated real estate operating company and investment manager focused on the development and acquisition of industrial properties in supply-constrained core markets in the U.S. and the U.K."" Thorngate residents opposing the project are also concerned about what impact it will have on the ""unique woodland preservation community."" In an email and press release sent to Patch, Caron Blitz, a Thorngate resident, said hundreds of local residents plan to meet up at Deerfield Village Hall with signs at 6:30 p.m. April 27, prior to the meeting.

""This plan is detrimental to the safety of our communities and threatens the environment for our residents, our children, and wildlife,"" Barbara Raff, Thorngate Homeowners Association president, said in the news release.

When it comes to marketing, many companies want to know what kind of return they can expect from their investments. While predicting the future is uncertain, there are effective methods to test an offer before fully committing to it.

As the president of a performance agency with years of experience, I'll outline two of the most efficient and effective testing methods that provide real information to help you launch your campaign without risking too much investment too early.

1. Start A Pilot Program And Do A Beta Launch With Existing Clients

This method is suitable for SaaS and service businesses, as it eliminates the need to worry about a tangible product. Product companies can use a similar concept of pre-ordering to test the market.

Before launching, clearly communicate with your clients about the new program, its benefits and expectations. Then, simply ask if they'd like to be part of the beta testing.
‚Ä¢ Save resources and effort from perfecting the product.
‚Ä¢ Minimal impact if it doesn't work out.
‚Ä¢ Cost may be lower than the actual market launch, leading to inaccurate purchase intent.
‚Ä¢ Small client base may not provide enough data for determining product-market fit accurately.

A good example of a company benefiting from this testing method on an ongoing basis is Google, which is known for its willingness to launch imperfect new features and then iterate based on user feedback. This approach allows the company to quickly test and validate new ideas, rather than spending extensive time and resources developing a fully polished product that may or may not be successful in the market. For instance, Google Analytics was launched as a beta product in 2005 and provided basic web traffic data. During the beta testing period, Google received feedback and made improvements, including new features, a better user interface and increased data accuracy.

This method is similar to crowdfunding campaigns, where you create an ad campaign and test selling it in real time on PPC platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.

The key to success is to run everything as if you're actually selling the product, but keep in mind that the actual product may not be ready. In this case, honesty and clear expectations are crucial.

This method is ideal for startups that need to prove product-market fit and for simple product offers that can attract buyers through PPC. This test may not be the best option for complex offers with a long sales cycle.
‚Ä¢ Get real data from the marketplace.
‚Ä¢ Test various components of customer acquisition, such as messaging, marketing materials, landing pages and pricing.
‚Ä¢ Cannot actually sell the product as it may not be ready.
‚Ä¢ Lack of clear messaging or expectations can lead to a reputation crisis.

Slack is a workplace communication platform that used PPC advertising to quickly build brand awareness and prove product-market fit in a crowded market. The company ran targeted ads on Google and other search engines, driving users to its website to try its product for free. The company carefully monitored the performance of its PPC campaigns, using data and insights to optimize ad targeting and messaging. As a result of these efforts, Slack was able to rapidly acquire a large and engaged user base, demonstrating a strong product-market fit.

The success of Slack's PPC campaigns helped the company secure additional funding and accelerate its growth, ultimately leading to its acquisition by Salesforce in December 2020 for $27.7 billion. Slack's example highlights the power of PPC advertising as a tool for startups to quickly build brand awareness, drive early user adoption, and validate a product or business idea in a cost-effective manner.

Testing the market is an important step in launching a successful campaign. If real data and realistic results are what you're after, these are two effective ways to test a new product or offer.

Some 93,697 pounds of raw ground beef products produced by Texas' Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., are being recalled by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, because of possible contamination with a ""foreign matter."" The products affected by the recall, and by the possible contamination, are:

There were no reported adverse consequences for customers who might have consumed the products, according to the FSIS, but the public health regulator warned people who might still have the products in their fridges or freezers not to consume them, but to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.

Tyson Fresh Meats has a consumer hotline, available at 1-855-382-3101, for anyone with questions about the product recall.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The Justice Department and several states sued Google on Tuesday, alleging that its dominance in digital advertising harms competition.

The government alleges that Google‚Äôs plan to assert dominance has been to ‚Äúneutralize or eliminate‚Äù rivals through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors‚Äô products.

The antitrust suit was filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Attorney General Merrick Garland was expected to discuss it at a news conference later Tuesday.

The DOJ‚Äôs suit accuses Google of unlawfully monopolizing the way ads are served online by excluding competitors. This includes its 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick, a dominant ad server, and subsequent rollout of technology that locks in the split-second bidding process for ads that get served on Web pages.

More job cuts in the tech sector could follow in the weeks to come: Google and Amazon have recently instituted hiring slowdowns and freezes, according to the Washington Post, and Amazon is planning to lay off about 10,000 employees, the New York Times reports.

So this begs the question: Where will all of these workers go?

Masha Bucher believes that some of the people impacted by tech layoffs this year will go on to start their own successful companies ‚Äî so much so that she's willing to bet $2 million on it.

On Nov. 8, Day One Ventures, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm Bucher launched in 2018, announced ""Funded Not Fired,"" a program that aims to invest $100,000 into 20 new startups that each have at least one founder who has been recently laid off from a tech company.

""VC investors are sitting on billions of dollars, and now we have thousands of talented people in engineering, salespeople, support staff and other functions looking for new job opportunities ‚Äî so why not direct some of this money towards them?"" Bucher, who is also general partner at the firm, tells CNBC Make It.

The 33-year-old understands firsthand the fear and confusion that comes with getting let go ‚Äî she's been laid off twice during her career, the first time when she was just 19 years old. While she felt ""discouraged and embarrassed"" at the time, Bucher is ultimately grateful for the experience.

""Being laid off was the best thing that ever happened to me,"" she says, adding that it was a ""wake-up call"" for her to become a full-time entrepreneur.

Born and raised in rural Russia, Bucher spent the earlier part of her career at the helm of Nashi, a pro-government Russian youth movement backed by the Kremlin (she maintains that she has long avoided Russian funding and told the Wall Street Journal that her past with Nashi was ""another life"").

In 2014, Bucher immigrated to the U.S. and opened M&A PR studio, which has led publicity campaigns for clients including Houzz, HotelTonight and WeWork among other tech companies (the studio is still active, however, Bucher left it in 2018 to focus on building Day One Ventures).

Bucher leveraged the skills and connections from her blossoming tech career to start Day One Ventures just four years later. The firm has raised about $100 million, investing that money in over 100 companies and spearheading their communication strategies. Day One Ventures' portfolio includes a diverse range of businesses, from email tool Superhuman to parenting website Winnie.

Aspiring founders don't need a fully fleshed out startup pitch to qualify for the program ‚Äî the application just asks for details on the founders' backgrounds, their startup ideas, business interests, areas of expertise and a convincing reason for why they should receive the funds.

The deadline to apply for the ""Funded Not Fired"" is Nov. 25, 2022 and final decisions will be announced by Dec. 20, 2022. Bucher says she and her team have already received hundreds of applications.

She stressed that the program is ""not charity"" and that former employees from Stripe and Twitter will not get preferential treatment, even though they were the inspiration behind ""Funded Not Fired.""

""I hope we are doing something more than just giving tech workers hope,"" Bucher says. ""Being a founder can be one of the most creative, rewarding jobs in the world, one in which you can have a great, far-reaching impact ‚Ä¶ I want to introduce people to that path, and show them that there are other ways to be successful.""

What's happening: Technology moves faster than Congress can keep up with, and in the absence of new laws, lasting decisions about tech regulation are being determined by judges and courts across the country.

Driving the news: Federal agencies, state governments and attorneys representing different interests and motives for trying to regulate the tech industry are pushing cases forward.
‚Ä¢ A high-profile instance came last week when the Supreme Court heard two major arguments about liability protections for user content that longstanding federal law grants to tech platforms.

Between the lines: There's widespread agreement this is not an ideal way of determining tech policy. Lawsuits are expensive and time-consuming and can muddy as much as they clarify.
‚Ä¢ Industry and consumer advocates such as pro-privacy groups would all rather see Congress step in than hope that a court will interpret current law to their preference.

What they're saying: ""As we saw last week in Gonzalez v. Google, even Supreme Court justices don't know where to draw the line ‚Äî saying that Congress is better equipped to make calls on these critical issues. We agree,"" Carl Holshouser, senior vice president of tech industry advocacy firm TechNet, told Axios.
‚Ä¢ He added: ""Instead of a system that takes years, costs a lot of money and resources for all involved, and often lacks consistency, Congress must do its constitutional duty and make the laws, and in some cases, update them as necessary.""
‚Ä¢ ""While the courts wrestle with Section 230 and First Amendment issues, Congress can act to address other critical digital policy issues like ensuring consumers have baseline federal privacy protections,"" Matt Schruers, president of pro-tech group the Computer & Communications Industry Association, told Axios.

The big picture: Congress missed a big opportunity to pass comprehensive tech policy legislation last year, before Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. With the Senate still in Democrats' hands, consensus will be even harder to come by ‚Äî making the courts' role even more consequential.

These are some of the most important tech policy battles now playing out in the U.S. courts:
‚Ä¢ Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh at the Supreme Court: Congress has ben talking for years about making changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that largely keeps tech platforms from being held liable for users' posts, but the Supreme Court ended up tackling the law first. A decision on whether to narrow this key internet law is due by early summer.
‚Ä¢ NetChoice v. Moody/Paxton: Republicans in Congress have argued for years that social media platforms take down too much speech, while Democrats argue they could do more to limit harmful content. Neither party has managed to do much nationally about these complaints. But Republican leaders in Texas and Florida did pass laws to compel platforms to carry certain kinds of speech. Those laws are under challenge by tech groups, and the cases are likely to be heard by the Supreme Court.
‚Ä¢ Social media multi-district litigation: Earlier this month, a master complaint with at least 125 plaintiffs was filed against Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube and Meta, alleging the platforms are designed to exploit younger users and keep them hooked, leading to mental health problems and instances of suicide. A court finding that tech platforms designed harmful, addictive products and are liable for them would go far beyond Congress' efforts on these issues.
‚Ä¢ Federal and state antitrust cases against Google: Three suits are playing out against Google; two concerning advertising technology and another about search competition, even as the search competition landscape shifts with new rollouts of AI-driven chat interfaces. Those cases will take years to resolve, but they still hold the potential for action ‚Äî while the last Congress' efforts to pass a big package of antitrust bills that would impact Google ultimately fizzed out.
‚Ä¢ FTC lawsuits: The FTC has urged Congress to pass new privacy and antitrust laws, but in the absence of legislation, the agency under chair Lina Khan is trying its hand at blocking mergers in court. The first high-profile case the agency fought, over Meta's acquisition of virtual reality fitness startup Within, ended in defeat, but Khan is expected to press more cases.

What to watch: Court decisions that anger the public or frustrate companies could jolt Congress into action down the road.
‚Ä¢ In the Google v. Gonzalez case specifically, justices are likely to ask Congress to step in to clarify content liability rules, Ben Sperry, associate director for legal research at the International Center for Law and Economics, told Axios: ""My intuition is they won't take the invitation to significantly change the status quo, just by listening to the oral arguments...

The nation‚Äôs largest drugstore chain by store count has said it will close 900 stores through 2024.

Vacant CVS stores are showing up more frequently in Dallas-Fort Worth. CVS said in late 2021 that it planned to close 300 stores a year, for three years, to ‚Äúreduce store density.‚Äù

Store closings started in spring 2022 and have included locations in Texas, one of CVS‚Äô largest states with 850 stores.

A company spokeswoman said the retailer is not breaking out store closing numbers by state or market.

Boarded up CVS stores are on the northwest corner of Greenville and Ross avenues in Lower Greenville, on the southwest corner of Greenville and Lovers Lane in East Dallas and on Davis Boulevard in North Richland Hills. Another store closed last year in Plano on the northwest corner of Independence Parkway and West 15th Street. A Richardson location is scheduled to close in mid-March on Spring Valley Road just east of N. Central Expressway, according to employees.

Last year, CVS closed 306 stores, relocated four and opened 41 new stores to end the year with 9,674 stores.

For years, Walgreens and CVS fiercely competed for the best corner lots in North Texas. Walgreens has been in the Dallas market for decades. CVS arrived in 2001 and took a big leap in local store count in 2004 with the acquisition of the Eckerd drugstore chain that included 150 D-FW stores.

CVS said it had been ‚Äúevaluating changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumer and for the business.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only retailer evaluating its fleet. Even before the pandemic led more shoppers online, retailers tried to figure out how many stores they need in each market after years of overbuilding.

The company‚Äôs total store count includes CVS pharmacies inside Target stores. Target sold its pharmacies to CVS in 2015 for $1.9 billion and CVS has since expanded inside 200 more Targets for a total of 1,880.

Walgreens has closed about 200 stores in the last couple of years and now has 8,886 stores in the U.S.

Competition for drug store pharmacies has come from Walmart, all the big supermarket chains including Albertsons, Tom Thumb, Kroger, H-E-B and, more recently, Amazon and startups such as Mark Cuban‚Äôs Cost Plus Drug Co. based in Dallas.

Still, CVS is a huge provider of prescription drugs. Last year it dispensed about 26.8% of total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the U.S., according to its most recent annual filing.

Drugstores played a huge role during the pandemic as pharmacists administered COVID-19 vaccinations first to residents of nursing homes and then to the general public from their convenient neighborhood locations.

The purchase would make Blackstone the largest manager of CLOs in the $1.2 trillion global market that repackages leveraged loans into bonds. With the addition of AIG‚Äôs CLOs, Blackstone will have around $51 billion of such assets under management, just edging past Carlyle Group Inc.

The deal underscores the allure of the CLO management business: It has seen a boom in activity, as well as new entrants. Running contrary to a dip in overall transactions, CLO firms set a record for mergers and acquisitions in 2022, according to Citigroup Inc. On the flip side, some money managers struggled to find buyers for new issues in the second half of last year amid market volatility.

Carlyle, the holder of the mantle of the biggest CLO shop before the Blackstone-AIG transaction, itself bought CBAM Partners from Todd Boehly‚Äôs investment company to gain that title last year.

Blackstone intends to hold the acquired CLO shop as a separate entity from its current platform, according to people familiar with the matter who aren‚Äôt authorized to speak publicly. Rather than simply buying the CLO assets as in some transactions, Blackstone will be gaining some staff as well, according to the people.

AIG had re-entered the CLO management business in 2018 with the purchase of Covenant Credit Partners, a small CLO manager led by industry veteran Marc Boatwright with $900 million of assets, and printed its first post-financial crisis CLO deal later that year.

The insurance firm, which required a government bailout during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, had spun off its asset management arm in 2010 to Pacific Century Group. That business was renamed PineBridge Investments LLC. AIG had been investing in CLOs before the purchase of Covenant Credit.

The transaction was previously reported by Creditflux.

The besuited youngster, who was already an ardent supporter of then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher, calmly explained to a French reporter that he had put his plans in motion five years earlier when he invested a ¬£50 inheritance in the shares of utility firm GEC.

Now a millionaire many times over, the newly installed business secretary could be set for a further windfall from the potential sale of Somerset Capital Management, the investment firm he helped launch in 2007.

It emerged on Thursday that talks were under way to sell Somerset, as its co-founder and chief executive Dominic Johnson prepares to follow in Rees-Mogg‚Äôs footsteps and shift into a career in politics.

A sale could result in a multimillion pound payout for the business minister, who stopped receiving wages from the firm in 2019, but remains an equity-holding member. His shareholding is understood to be in the low teens, though this is information is not publicly available. In 2018, during inconclusive merger talks with a US firm, Somerset is believed to have been valued at between ¬£70m and ¬£100m. At the time, it managed $10bn of assets on behalf of a combination of individual and institutional investors, though that sum has since dropped to $5bn.

Media reports suggest the staunch Brexiter had pocketed at least ¬£7m in dividends from Somerset since the EU referendum in 2016, and before he stopped taking a salary, Rees-Mogg received about ¬£15,000 a month from the firm on top of his MP‚Äôs pay.

Somerset has traditionally invested in listed companies based in emerging markets including China, Korea, India and Mexico, and is believed to have benefited from the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote as its holdings were overseas.

His payouts from Somerset have continued, despite being a so-called sleeper shareholder who no longer plays a role in advising on the investment strategy or the running of the business. Rees-Mogg reportedly received dividends worth at least ¬£600,000 last year, according to the Times, though that was down from ¬£800,000 a year earlier due to a 35% slide in the profits, linked in part to an emerging markets sell-off.

Analysis of the firm‚Äôs investments, based on data provided by research agency Morningstar, shows holdings in major Chinese companies including Alibaba, and Tencent, which runs social media platform WeChat and holds stakes in Spotify, Tesla, Snapchat, Monzo and Reddit.

There are also stakes in Samsung, and chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing which is reportedly in line to supply Apple‚Äôs iPhones and Macs next year.

Somerset has also taken a punt on Infosys ‚Äì the global IT company founded by Indian billionaire NR Narayana Murthy, the father-in-law of former chancellor Rishi Sunak ‚Äì as well as Taco Bell-owner Yum China, and beer companies Budweiser and Heineken.

The data also shows the firm holds small stakes in a handful of Russian firms including search engine Yandex, online recruitment company HeadHunter, and TCS Holding Group, which in turn owns the country‚Äôs second-largest credit card issuer, Tinkoff Bank.

The cabinet minister, whose father, William Rees-Mogg, was editor of the Times throughout the 1970s, previously undertook to reduce his stake in Somerset. He also holds a sprawling property portfolio including two flats in Pall Mall, owned by his company Saliston, as well as a former schoolhouse near Gournay Court ‚Äì a Grade II*-listed Somerset mansion inhabited by his mother ‚Äì and a bungalow in Midsomer Norton.

Before setting up Somerset, Rees-Mogg worked for hedge funds in Hong Kong and Mayfair, and is one of the richest ministers in prime minister Liz Truss‚Äôs cabinet.

Spear‚Äôs Wealth Management estimated in 2019 that his net worth was ‚Äúwell over ¬£100m‚Äù, a figure which also accounted for the expected inheritance of his wife, Lady Helena de Chair, whose mother was said to have a ¬£45m fortune.

Oliver Crawley, a partner at Somerset, stressed that Rees-Mogg had not had played a role in any of the firm‚Äôs investment decisions for over a decade. ‚ÄúAny partnership interest in Somerset is held in abeyance in accordance with the ministerial code,‚Äù he added.

Following disappointing results from Snap last week and a 28% plunge in the stock price that sent the company's value to its lowest since early 2019, investors are now turning their attention to ad giants Meta and Alphabet as well as reports this week from Twitter and Pinterest . They'll also hear from Amazon and Microsoft , which have big ad businesses of their own. The flurry of reports comes at a time of extreme skepticism in web and mobile advertising. Facebook parent Meta shares are down more than 60% this year, and the company is expected to report a second straight drop in revenue. Alphabet, which has slid 30% in 2022, is forecast to report single-digit sales growth. Aside from one quarter at the beginning of the pandemic, that would mark the weakest period for Google's parent since 2013. The economic downturn and fears of a recession have many marketers reining in spending. At the same time, Apple's iOS privacy change from last year continues to punish companies ‚Äî notably Snap and Facebook ‚Äî that have historically relied on user data to target ads. ""Sentiment in the online advertising space has softened of late, with more anecdotes of budget cuts as well as advertisers holding back some budget in hopes of a 4Q flush,"" UBS analysts wrote in a report last week. ""Looking into '23, we think planning amidst this level of macro uncertainty sets the stage for below-consensus growth in '23, even if macro does not significantly deteriorate from here."" UBS said it would ""reduce estimates and price targets across the online advertising group"" due to both the economic environment and a strong U.S. dollar. Through discussions with digital ad agencies, the analysts said they learned that ""many advertising directors are pulling back certain budgets, particularly among smaller advertisers."" In Snap's report on Thursday, the company said results are being hit by a combination of platform changes, economic challenges and competition. For a second straight quarter, Snap said it wouldn't be providing guidance for the coming period because of difficulty in predicting the economic trajectory.

""We are finding that our advertising partners across many industries are decreasing their marketing budgets, especially in the face of operating environment headwinds, inflation-driven cost pressures and rising costs of capital,"" Snap said. If the third quarter mirrors the second, Snap's brutal report could spell dismal results for its industry peers. In July, Meta, Twitter , Pinterest , and Google all reported weaker-than-expected results following Snap's miss. Investors started planning ahead last week, sending Pinterest shares down more than 6% on Friday after Snap's report. Twitter fell almost 5% and Meta dropped more than 1%. Alphabet rose over 1%, but still underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which jumped 2.3%. CNBC's Jim Cramer and the Investing Club said there's a chance Snap's poor results won't reflect the overall online advertising market. Meta and Alphabet ""have built multifaceted digital ecosystems"" that dwarf the smaller Snap, thus making those companies ""more immune from weaker digital ad spend,"" the Investing Club wrote. The industry drama this week isn't limited to earnings reports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has until Friday to close his proposed $44 billion acquisition of Twitter if he wants to avoid a trial. After changing his mind on the deal multiple times and being sued, Musk said earlier this month that he wanted to complete the transaction at the originally agreed upon price of $54.20 a share. Twitter wants to make sure the financing is in place before backing off the lawsuit. Twitter shares closed last week below $50, suggesting investors still aren't convinced the deal will close. Meanwhile, the business has been struggling. Analysts are anticipating a drop in third-quarter revenue in the company's earnings report, which is expected this week. One bright spot in the online advertising space could be Amazon after its digital ad business grew 18% in the second quarter, topping all of the major players in the industry. While retailers may be pulling back on spending on Facebook and elsewhere, Amazon is a stickier platform for them because people who use it are shopping for stuff. For companies to keep their brands visible on the largest e-commerce site, they have to pay the platform. But even Amazon's core business has suffered this year, with growth slowing dramatically from its boom days during the pandemic. Overall revenue expansion was in the single digits for three straight quarters and the stock is down 28% for the year. By the time Amazon closes out Big Tech earnings week on Thursday, investors should have a much clearer picture of the online ad market and how much companies are tightening their belts heading into the holiday season.

But some big names have defied the trend. Buybacks of stocks within the S & P 500 are down 21% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period a year ago, said Goldman Sachs' Ryan Hammond. The slide comes as the biggest corporations in America tighten their belts to contend with economic contraction and higher interest rates. For the full year, companies in the S & P 500 are expected to spend a total of $808 billion repurchasing shares in 2023, Hammond said. That would mark an approximately 15% fall from the $950 billion seen in 2022. Still, the 2023 projection is around 50% higher than the amount spent in 2020. Buybacks are an area of corporate spending that the analyst estimates should be particularly hard hit this year. In total, cash spending from companies in the S & P 500 is expected to fall by a relatively modest 1% in 2023, alongside decelerating earnings per share growth. Hammond expects companies to spend more on dividends, capital expenditures and research and development in 2023 versus last year, while the amount spent on buybacks and cash acquisitions is expected to shrink. ""The slowdown is already under way, particularly in buybacks,"" he said in a Tuesday note to clients. Hammond also said buybacks could be especially hard hit in a recession scenario as they are one of the ""most volatile uses of cash."" Still, he said investors will reward the companies that return cash to shareholders more than those investing in growth in the current environment. He noted that companies returning cash to shareholders have outperformed those investing excess cash in research and development by 3 percentage points since March 8. With this in mind, Hammond screened the 10 largest buyback-paying stocks in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the 10, only Meta Platforms and Microsoft have increased their buybacks in the first quarter of this year. META MSFT YTD mountain Meta and Microsoft Facebook-parent Meta increased its share repurchase authorization to $40 billion. By comparison, the company bought back about $28 billion in shares last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, increased its buyback by just 1% from the prior quarter, according to Hammond. Both announcements come as technology companies have tried to curb costs through measures like layoffs amid concerns over the broader economy and cooling advertising spending. Notably, Apple and Alphabet , the two companies with the most buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2022, both pulled back on the amount they put toward share repurchases this quarter, he said. ‚Äî CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report","Goldman says share buybacks on pace to tumble this year, but 2 stocks are bucking the trend",non-causal,"YTD, MSFT, CNBC, META",['A'],[],"['CNBC', 'YTD', 'META', 'MSFT']","['CNBC', 'MSFT', 'YTD', 'MET', 'META', 'A']",-0.9845389

Not all consumer staples will be impacted the same by currency fluctuations and changes in the international economy, said Goldman Sachs.

The headline earnings decline worsened, but the details were more supportive for stocks. The S&P 500 rose by 0.7% for the week. While the earnings from the smaller banks weren‚Äôt good, they outperformed the dour expectations, sending the KBW Regional Bank index 7.3% higher. This week will be the second busiest of this earnings season, with over 160 companies reporting. A more detailed preview of the earnings season is available here. While it is almost assured that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again this week, the next step remains unclear.

At this point in the reporting season, blended earnings, which combine actual with estimates of companies yet to report, are significantly worse than forecasts at the end of the quarter. The consumer discretionary sector is expected to post the highest year-over-year growth rate at 31.0%. This increase is primarily due to Amazon .com (AMZN), which had a loss in the second quarter of 2022 but is expected to report a profit for the same period this year. Amazon is over 20% of the sector‚Äôs market capitalization, so it has an outsized influence on its growth rate.

Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. With nominal GDP growth decelerating year-over-year for the second quarter, topline revenue growth for companies will be more challenging. So far, with a few companies reporting, sales growth has been consistent with expectations going into the earnings season.

The over 30% year-over-year decrease in the average oil price for the quarter has caused expectations for year-over-year revenues for the energy industry to contract similarly. Energy companies are expected to have the most significant year-over-year decline in earnings this quarter, driven by the plunge in topline sales. Expectations for the energy sector fell further this week, with the behemoths Chevron (CVX ) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) scheduled to report earnings on Friday.

Warren Buffett has remained upbeat on the sector as regulatory filings showed that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA, BRKB) bought more Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares in June and now owns more than 25% of the company. Berkshire has a significant stake in Chevron but has been trimming it in recent quarters in favor of Occidental. A previous piece discussed why Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum, which is scheduled to report on August 2.

So far, the blended earnings performance has slightly underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at -9.0% year-over-year, well behind the expectation of -6.8% at the end of the quarter and deteriorated sharply this week.

The headline earnings reading is worse than the details in this case. According to FactSet, a large earnings charge for Merck‚Äôs (MRK) acquisition of Prometheus was included in the estimates for the second quarter. This charge dragged down the healthcare sector and the index headline result. Outside of healthcare, more sectors had increases in earnings expectations for the week than decreases. The most considerable improvement came in consumer discretionary, where Tesla (TSLA) and D.R. Horton (DHI) reported better-than-expected results.

Generally, the smaller banks‚Äô earnings and outlooks weren‚Äôt as good as the mega banks. A significant number of smaller banks reported below consensus earnings. Despite the worse-than-expected earnings reports, the regional bank stocks soared for the week, outperforming the larger banks, which also did quite well. Low expectations, valuations, and declining risk of a banking crisis reescalation seem to have made up for the current earnings shortfalls. For more about the U.S. banking system, including the valuation of the stocks, a recent update is here.

Outside of earnings season, the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday will be closely watched despite the outcome being almost preordained. While the Fed is nearly certain to increase short-term interest rates by another 25 basis points (0.25%), the question remains whether this will be the last hike of the cycle. The bond market expects this to be the final hike, with cuts possibly commencing at the end of the year. With the labor market remaining resilient and second-quarter GDP likely to reflect continued momentum in the U.S. economy, Fed Chair Powell should push back against these dovish assumptions.

The second quarter GDP release, which comes a day after the Federal Reserve decision, should continue to reflect reasonable economic growth and may even be an acceleration over the first quarter‚Äôs pace. The Atlanta Fed estimates a 2.4% growth rate, while consensus is a bit lower at 1.8%. In any case, the report should reinforce that the short-term risks of recession remain low.

While the relationship pulled back a bit this week, the outperformance of cyclical stocks relative to staples since May underscores that markets have priced in the rising probability of the Fed being able to engineer a soft landing. The reverse in the trend this week is likely a function of the cyclical stocks needing a breather, but it bears watching if the trend persists.

This week will have many companies reporting and not likely to be subject to the same distortion as last week, so it will be instructive to see if the earnings performance resumes its relative improvement. In addition, the Federal Reserve rate policy outlook should impact how the markets weigh the odds of a soft economic landing.",Earnings Season Accelerates With The Fed Set To Hike Rates,causal,"KBW, OXY, BRKB, CVX, BRKA, GDP, DHI, XOM, TSLA, AMZN, MRK","['HPC', 'US']",[],"['GDP', 'BRKB', 'MRK', 'XOM', 'OXY', 'AMZN', 'KBW', 'DHI', 'TSLA', 'CVX', 'BRKA']","['GDP', 'BRKB', 'MRK', 'XOM', 'OXY', 'AMZN', 'KHC', 'HPC', 'KBW', 'DHI', 'TSLA', 'CVX', 'BRKA', 'US']",0.08505523

Oct 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Friday as gloomy forecasts from megacaps Amazon and Apple heightened fears that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes were finally slowing the economy and could hammer corporate earnings.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) joined a chorus of Big Tech firms that have disappointed investors this week by forecasting a slowdown in sales growth for the all-important holiday season and warned of a hit to consumers' purchasing power. Shares cratered 13.6% in premarket trade.

Apple Inc (AAPL.O) cautioned revenue growth could see some pressure in the December quarter but shares edged 0.6% higher as the iPhone maker's fourth-quarter results showed some resilience.

Shares of other megacap tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O), which reported downbeat earnings earlier this week, were down between 0.4% and 1.3%. Their shares are down between 6% and 25% for the week.

Tech sector earnings were viewed as a major test of the strength of corporate America in the face of decades-high inflation and the dismal results have fed into fears of a looming recession from aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve.

While another 75 basis point rate hike from the Fed next week is largely priced in, traders are now waiting for a key U.S. inflation data due at 8:30 am ET to gauge whether the central bank could ease its pace of rate hikes in December.

The report is expected to show the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), the Fed's preferred inflation measure, climbed 5.2% on a year-over-year basis in September when stripped of volatile food and energy costs.

At 4:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 97 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 30 points, or 0.79%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 130.75 points, or 1.16%.

A report on Thursday showing a rebound in U.S. economic growth in the third quarter had helped ease slowdown fears.

Twitter (TWTR.N) was set to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, a day after Tesla (TSLA.O) chief Elon Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company. Arch Capital Group (ACGL.O) will replace Twitter on the S&P 500 from Nov. 1.

The test, which Netflix said is a limited beta test, will be available for a small number of subscribers in Canada and the U.K. starting Monday. Users will be able to stream games over the internet via select TVs, and on Macs and PCs through the Netflix website.

""Our goal has always been to have a game for everyone, and we are working hard to meet members where they are with an accessible, smooth, and ubiquitous service,"" Netflix VP of games, Mike Verdu, wrote in a blog post. ""Today, we‚Äôre taking the first step in making games playable on every device where our members enjoy Netflix ‚Äî TVs, computers, and mobile.""

Cloud gaming allows users to stream games from a company's servers directly to their TVs, laptops, desktops, smartphones, and tablets. Since the servers handle the graphics processing, gamers can play on traditionally underpowered devices, meaning they don't have to spend money on high-end gaming PCs or pricey consoles.

But you need a steady high-speed internet connection to ensure games come through clearly and lag free. If an on-screen character doesn't immediately respond to a player's controller input, it throws off the entire experience.

Netflix is starting out with two games, Night School Studio's ""Oxenfree"" and ""Molehew's Mining Adventure."" Netflix also says gamers will use their smartphones as controllers when playing on a TV and a mouse and keyboard when playing on a laptop or desktop.

Netflix has been offering mobile games as part of its subscription for some time, and its clear from its latest move that it sees gaming as another possible growth area moving forward.

Microsoft is the leader in the cloud gaming space thanks to its Xbox Cloud Gaming service. A part of Microsoft's $16.99 per month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, Xbox Cloud Gaming allows players to stream a massive library of games to their TVs, smartphones, tablets, PCs, and Macs.

Microsoft also releases first-party titles via Xbox Cloud Gaming on the same day they go on sale at retail. Sony also has a cloud gaming service as part of called PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for $17.99 per month. Sony has also recently started testing streaming PlayStation 5 games via the cloud.

Both Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) also offer cloud streaming services, as well. But giving users the option to stream games isn't a surefire win for Big Tech firms.

Google previously offered its own cloud gaming service called Google Stadia, but folded the venture due to a lack of users. According to The Wall Street Journal, though, the company is looking at building cloud gaming into its YouTube business.

Cloud gaming is still in its early stages, but companies are banking on it as a major piece of their gaming portfolios moving forward. Part of the reason Microsoft is acquiring ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard is to build out its cloud offerings. The Federal Trade Commission initially filed a lawsuit seeking to block the acquisition.

The broad market index's average one-year gain in 17 post-elections windows has been about 15%. Those facts are on our minds this Election Day, as voters cast their ballots amid a rough year on Wall Street. Everyone is wondering when we'll see, or whether we've already seen, the bottom in the current bear market. Of course, past performance is not indicative of future outcomes, and right now many strategists are worried that inflation and recession fears could continue to weigh on stocks . We recognize the uncertain macro environment may complicate the usual post-midterm rally. Nevertheless, we think the history is worth pointing out to Club members. We also wanted to zoom in on it through a Club-specific lens, analyzing how the 31 stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust have done in the 12 months following recent midterm elections. Here's what we did, with some caveats. We looked at only the past five midterms ‚Äî 2018, 2014, 2010, 2006 and 2002 ‚Äî to see which current Club stocks had the biggest 12-month gains following the election. The S & P 500's average 12-month gain following those five elections is 8.3%. One limitation of the exercise is that not every stock in our portfolio was publicly traded in all five election cycles. Salesforce (CRM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) held initial public offerings in the summer of 2004, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) went public in May 2012. While we chose to highlight the best performers, there were also underperformers and stocks that were in the red in each of the past cycles we looked at. This exercise is designed to show how much stocks moved during these bullish cycles not why they performed as they did. 2018 election These are the five Club stocks with the largest gain between Nov. 6, 2018 ‚Äî when the midterms were held ‚Äî and Nov. 6, 2019: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Microsoft (MSFT), Qualcomm (QCOM), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Estee Lauder (EL). The S & P 500 advanced 11.7% in that stretch. 2014 election The S & P 500 rose 4.5% between Nov. 4, 2014 and Nov. 4, 2015. These are the five best-performing Club stocks over those 12 months: Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Constellation Brands (STZ), Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms. 2010 election Between Nov. 2, 2010 and Nov. 2, 2011, the S & P 500 climbed 3.7%. These are the Club's top five performers in that span: Estee Lauder, Starbucks (SBUX), Humana (HUM), Bausch Health (BHC) and Costco Wholesale (COST). Note: This list does not include Coterra Energy (CTRA), which soared 163% in the 12 months following the 2010 midterms. The company was known as Cabot Oil & Gas back then. In 2021, it rebranded as Coterra following an all-stock merger of equals with Cimarex Energy. 2006 election The S & P 500 rose 6.7% between Nov. 7, 2006 and Nov. 7, 2007. These 5 Club names registered the largest gains during those 12 months: Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Nvidia and Google parent Alphabet. 2002 election Over the past five midterm cycles, the S & P 500 saw its largest 12-month gain between Nov. 5, 2002 and Nov. 6, 2003, jumping 14.9%. These are the best-performing Club holdings in that stretch: Amazon, AMD, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Humana and Wynn Resorts. Final Club thoughts Only two Club holdings outperformed the S & P 500 in each of the 12-month windows following a midterm election: Apple, which was the biggest winner in the 2006 cycle, and Honeywell (HON), even thought it never cracked the top five in an individual yearlong span. Interestingly, there were five Club holdings ‚Äî Apple, Amazon, Honeywell, Costco and Estee Lauder ‚Äî that were positive in the 12 months after the midterms in each of the past five election cycles. Finally, it's also worth reminding everyone that performance over a 12-month period following a specific event ‚Äî in this case, a midterm election ‚Äî is just a snapshot in time and does not, necessarily, reflect how the company's underlying business did during the period. A wide range of factors ‚Äî some specific to a company, others more macro in nature ‚Äî affect how a stock trades in the near term. But over the long run, the best companies tend to get rewarded by the market. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer' Charitable Trust.)

 Today's top stories

If you read my dispatch from Berlin last week, or reporting from my colleagues about $30 billion of stalled buyouts, or haven‚Äôt been living under a rock all year, you‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs not pretty out there right now for private equity dealmakers.

Confidence is in short supply and it‚Äôs been hard to predict where the terminal rate will land‚Äîmaking it difficult for buyout firms to forecast when assessing a potential target. Still, you‚Äôll always be able to find an optimist out there.

Enter Henning Schneider, a partner at Latham & Watkins in Hamburg who specializes in private equity, among other things, who tells me why he‚Äôs not giving into the gloom just yet. ‚ÄîJan-Henrik F√∂rster

M&A is depressed. Public markets are shut. How are you feeling?

I would be less depressed and somewhat more optimistic. One thing I see, and that could boost volumes later this year, is that strategic buyers are coming back. And I also noticed that auctions are coming back after a hiatus. Private equity, despite a lot of dry powder, has been cautious this year for all the reasons you know‚Äîfrom geopolitics to financing. Strategics are often more comfortable in such an environment as valuations are coming down. They sometimes may have certain advantages when it comes to financing over private equity and their balance sheets are in good shape, generally speaking.



Forgive me, but that all sounds a bit overoptimistic‚Ä¶

Well, people love to talk about their pipeline. Let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs still moving slow. However, I noticed clearly over the last weeks that activity is picking up just as holidays are around the corner. What is true is that most auctions move slow‚Äîbuyers look at every detail to find the hair in the ointment and to discuss EBITDA adjustments.

How hard is it to price deals in this environment?

Many sellers still have price expectations that are too high. That has also to do with Covid as historic financial data is less reliable. Sellers would point at their EBITDA numbers from 2021, whereas buyers would say ‚Äúwait a second, those figures were high because of the Covid effect.‚Äù Sponsors are more careful as they are buying with other people‚Äôs money.

Aren‚Äôt they under pressure to sell as well, so they can return some of that money?

That is certainly the case. For corporates it is easier to buy or sell in such a volatile environment as they don‚Äôt have exit pressure. While sponsors have that pressure, they also don‚Äôt want to sell under pressure. That doesn‚Äôt make it a better deal.

I‚Äôll let you end as you started: on a positive. Where do you see the action?

Buyers focus on industrial sectors with more predictable revenues. Healthcare and life sciences is a good example, we are quite busy with several deals here. Companies are ready to deploy. Hospitals and other service provider will always have patients. People always need care. I see more willingness on the buyside here to spend money. The same is true for everything that is related to healthy living. It‚Äôs a safe bet for investors. Here, I see that sponsors are preparing exits too. Big trends are, for instance, digitalization as well as outpatient care. And, finally, the healthcare sector is still in a process of further consolidation and is also trying to become more efficient.

‚Ä¢ Apple shares closed at a record in the latest sign of big tech‚Äôs dominance
‚Ä¢ Oracle topped sales estimates as AI mania continues

A 65-year-old former official at Samsung Electronics Co., the world‚Äôs biggest memory chipmaker, was arrested for allegedly stealing blueprints and design plans and trying to replicate an entire factory in China. If true, it‚Äôs one for the history books.

The location of the alleged criminally designed fab? A mere 1.5 kilometers from Samsung‚Äôs existing memory plant in Xi‚Äôan. That‚Äôs close enough for staff at the original facility to watch its construction from their office windows.

But our intrepid intellectual property interloper did more, Korean prosecutors allege. The exec was accused of poaching more than 200 semiconductor experts from Korea and stealing data worth over $200 million. The person worked at Samsung for 18 years, then another decade at a different firm.

That‚Äôs quite a legacy to risk. The case illustrates the lengths people and businesses will go to to secure the semiconductors they need. It was an international operation, spanning chip companies in China and Singapore, investments from mainland China and elsewhere, and pledges of (an undelivered) $6 billion funding from a Taiwanese firm, according to the Korean authorities.

The stakes are high and it‚Äôs not just the US and China that are in the game. From Japan, which is spending billions subsidizing a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. factory within its borders, to Korea, India and the EU, just about every major nation is eager to secure a domestic share of chipmaking leadership.

In today‚Äôs world, chips are the nutrients required to make anything grow, whether it‚Äôs a private business or a national economy. Without them, you can‚Äôt build electric vehicles, cellular networks or the next great AI innovation after ChatGPT. Nvidia Corp. briefly became a trillion-dollar company because it has the best AI-training chips. Oracle Corp. shares also just hit a record thanks to sales to artificial intelligence developers.

At the same time, supply of the vital components is fragmenting, thanks to growing, US-led sanctions on China, the world‚Äôs single biggest market for semiconductors. In Washington, calls to reduce the world‚Äôs reliance on major chipmaking centers like Taiwan and Korea are growing, prompting efforts to re-shore manufacturing.

Will the future be one of escalating multibillion-dollar IP espionage? That‚Äôs a question I‚Äôd rather leave open, though maybe this case out of Korea is showing us a glimpse of of what‚Äôs possible.

Whether it‚Äôs the experience of the pandemic-induced supply crunch ‚Äî and the way it scarred nationally-important industries like automaking ‚Äî or increasingly polarized international trade, there are good reasons now to discard the old expectation that you‚Äôll simply be able to buy whatever chips you need.

Major events that could affect your portfolio

There were a number of key pieces of economic data released this week, which the Fed will be keeping a close eye on as they head into the next FOMC meeting next Tuesday.

The U.S. Housing Price Index made an unexpected jump in February, with the average house price gaining 0.5% during the month. This was a pretty sizable departure from the consensus projections, which expected to see a fall of 0.2%.

Another real estate data set, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index confirmed the trend, increasing for the first time in seven months with a gain of 0.2%.

But this was the only component of this week's economic data that showed positive signs, with both GDP and consumer confidence both continuing a downward trend.

Consumer confidence fell to a nine month low in April, hitting 101.3 from 104.0 in March. This was worse than analysts' predictions, which had suggested the figure would hold steady at 104.

GDP was the other big one this week, with the economy growing at an annualized rate of 1.1% in Q1. That‚Äôs below the expectation of 1.9% and significantly below last quarter‚Äôs rate of 2.6%.

Other than the unusual jump in property prices, which is likely to be short lived, the economic data is all trending downwards. That‚Äôs a positive for the Fed as it suggests inflation could follow, but a potential recession is something that investors will need to look out for closely.

Against that backdrop, it‚Äôs not actually been a bad start to the Q1 earnings season. This week saw a number of big name companies announce their financial results from the first three months of the year, and there have been some surprising numbers.

To start with, the big banks got the year off to a flying start, with very strong results for those banks with big retail businesses. Some had been concerned that we may see further evidence of cracks in the financial sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. While we did see some of that in regional banks (more on that in a second), the majors were apparently unaffected.

JPMorgan led the way with a 52% uplift in earnings, while Citigroup also increased its profit to $4.6 billion. Bank of America followed suit with a 15% bump in profits, and Wells Fargo grew net income by 30%.

Big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley make a large proportion of their income from mergers and acquisitions, and they‚Äôve been feeling the heat as this activity has dropped off a cliff.

Likewise, regional banks suffered, particularly First Republic Bank which announced a 40% drop in earnings and details of $100m in short term loans from the Fed.

In tech, Microsoft, Meta and Google posted strong results, with their stock prices bouncing 9%, 12% and 3% respectively after the announcements. On the flipside, Tesla stock sank 18% off the bank of a lackluster earnings call.

All signs (well, most signs) are pointing to a recession right now. Apart from the odd anomaly here and there, economic data is pointed firmly in that direction. The likelihood of further rate increases from the Fed is still high, which will continue to prod the economy in that direction.

For investors, it‚Äôs a difficult spot to be in. While we didn‚Äôt officially enter a recession last year, we saw how volatile markets can be during periods of economic turmoil.

So what can you do? One of the most common knee jerk reactions is to move assets to cash. It seems like a safe thing to do, because the nominal value of cash doesn‚Äôt change. But there are a number of problems with that.

Firstly, inflation is still high, meaning the purchasing power (or real value) of your cash is guaranteed to go down each year. If inflation is 6% and your bank account interest is 3%, it means you‚Äôre losing 3% in real terms.

Second, when do you decide the best time to get back in? Missing just a few big days in markets can mean a massive difference in your long term returns. Timing the market perfectly to move back in is almost impossible, even for professional investors with big teams and budgets.

The better option is to invest in assets that tend to perform better than most during a recession. This is why we‚Äôve just launched the Recession Resistance Kit, which does exactly that. Using the power of AI, it invests in recession resistant sectors like health care and utilities, to help you access gains, regardless of economic conditions.

It's also home to one of the worst airports, Dulles International.

Reagan is a gem for air travelers. It‚Äôs beautifully remodeled, usually easy to get through the TSA lines, and contains good restaurants and gates within a few minutes of the main terminal. Most importantly, there is no other major airport in the country that I know of where you can leave downtown and arrive at the airport in less than 20 minutes when traffic isn‚Äôt heavy. Dulles is almost an hour from D.C., is crowded, and has a crazy train system that doesn‚Äôt even get you close to the planes but can add another 30 minutes to the travel time.

CONSERVATIVE GROUP TARGETS BANK OF AMERICA IN NEW AD CAMPAIGN OVER ESG

That is all a prelude to saying that a new bipartisan proposal sponsored by Reps. Hank Johnson (D-GA) and Burgess Owens (R-UT), the Direct Capital Access Act, would increase the number of flights in and out of Reagan National Airport. It's a dream come true for air travelers. It‚Äôs long overdue.

Reagan was originally built to provide an easily accessible airport for members of Congress to fly in and out of. But it is still operating under archaic and outdated rules that were, believe it or not, written in 1966 ‚Äî more than a half-century ago when The Beverly Hillbillies was a hit television show. There are so many dumb rules that still apply to Reagan that there isn‚Äôt enough space in this column to recite them all.

Reagan is the only airport in the country that is subject to federal restrictions on the number of allowed daily flights. This makes no sense anymore because the airport has just been modernized with more gates. So, increasing the number of inbound and outbound flights during nonpeak times is a no-brainer.

Over the last 50 years, the amount of air travel in and out of D.C. has increased tenfold ‚Äî or about three times faster than the number of flights. Now you know why you‚Äôre getting stuck in the middle seats. If these trends continue, the airlines will have to stuff passengers in the baggage compartments.

Even worse is a ‚Äúperimeter rule‚Äù written when LBJ was president, which restricts the overall number of flights that can take off and land outside a 1,250-mile radius of Washington. That was a noise control regulation because back 40 and 50 years ago, jets were much louder and a nuisance to neighborhoods near the runways. But today, planes are much quieter, and so this issue is now moot (or mute). As a consequence, if you want to fly nonstop to the western cities such as Los Angeles or Seattle, with few exceptions, you have to trek out to Dulles, in the northern Virginia exurban parts of Fairfax and Loudoun counties. Or to even further out to BWI, near Baltimore, Maryland.

The House bill would add 20 to 25 inbound/outbound flights a day from Reagan as part of the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill this fall. You don‚Äôt have to be a Ph.D. in economics to realize instantly that the main impact of this pro-consumer reform would be to increase competition and lower airfares. Here is an Economics 101 lesson for members of Congress who oppose this reform: If you increase the supply of something, its price goes down. The reform bill would also allow more nonstop flights to Denver, LAX, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Francisco, and Seattle.

So, who would be opposed to this? The two loudest lobbying voices against the measure are United Airlines and American Airlines. Why? Because United has a hub at Dulles and so is hotly opposed to diverting air passengers to the rival airport across town. American has a hub at Reagan, and so it doesn‚Äôt want Delta and Southwest and JetBlue competing with its high-priced flights out of Reagan. They don‚Äôt have any legitimate public policy objection: It‚Äôs just about protecting their turf from competition.

Guess what major airport in the United States has nearly the highest ticket prices? Reagan. This measure won‚Äôt just increase the ease of travel for D.C. residents and business travelers. It will lower prices.

Why aren‚Äôt the Federal Trade Commission and the FAA, with leaders chosen by President Joe Biden, at the front of the line pushing this pro-passenger measure? Over the past year, airline costs have risen by 18% and are expected to rise even faster this summer. FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan is trying to blow up airline mergers, for example, the proposed JetBlue and Spirit marriage, because she wrongly says it will raise ticket prices. But she‚Äôs been silent on the Reagan Airport issue.

What is even more incomprehensible is that the two Democratic senators from Virginia, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, as well as the northern Virginia congressional delegation, are against the Reagan expansion plan. Hello! Reagan is in northern Virginia, where the population has tripled in 50 years. They don‚Äôt want more flights?

The bill is estimated to create more than 1,000 new jobs and generate up to $400 million in economic benefit to the capital region. And most of the travelers who will benefit from the lower airline prices live in Virginia. Has there ever been as clear-cut a case of House and Senate members misrepresenting the interests of their constituents? Perhaps they think United Airlines, not voters, is their most important constituent.

Someone ought to remind Congress that we are living in 2023, not 1966, and that today, airline travel is for everyone, not just the rich and powerful as it once was when Pan Am and its short-skirted flight attendants ruled the skies and served martinis to wealthy CEOs.

The Apple executives ‚Äî Eduardo Cue, John Giannandrea and Adrian Perica ‚Äî had argued in Washington, D.C., federal court that compelling them to testify at trial was ""duplicative"" and ""unduly burdensome,"" since they had already answered questions at an earlier stage in the case.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in a brief order on Monday denied Apple's effort to quash the subpoenas.

Companies often try to bar or minimize subpoenas seeking testimony or information from top executives.

Apple, which is not a defendant, said it has been the subject of ""overbroad"" demands in the case and that it already has disclosed more than 125,000 documents from senior executives.

Cue oversees Apple Music, Apple TV and other services. Giannandrea is the executive in charge of machine learning and AI strategy, and Perica oversees Apple's corporate development wing, including leading the company's mergers and acquisitions efforts.

Representatives from Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.

Google and its lawyers have denied any wrongdoing in the case, one of two Justice Department antitrust lawsuits against Google.

A lawyer for Google, John Schmidtlein, told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in D.C. at a hearing this year that ""offering a superior product, winning business on the merits is never unlawful.""

The Justice Department said its case centers on Google's sharing of billions of dollars in annual advertising revenue with business partners such as Apple in exchange for Google's search being default on other companies' devices.

The government has called Apple ""chief among Google's distribution partners"" and said Google's relationship with Apple through an information-services agreement ""will be a central issue at trial.""

Apple's attorneys warned recently that trial testimony would force the lawyers and Mehta to ""navigate the risks of inadvertent disclosure of its most competitively sensitive information.""

In a filing, Apple said it wanted to shield information concerning business negotiations, confidential contract terms and ""forward-looking product opportunities.""

Attorneys for Apple argued that the company had ""provided all the discovery (and more) that the parties could need for trial.""

The bench trial is set to begin on Sept. 12 in Mehta's court.

The case is United States v. Google, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:20-cv-03010-APM.

Nadella lauded the company‚Äôs accomplishments in a missive shared on Microsoft‚Äôs internal message boards on Thursday ‚Äî the last day of the company‚Äôs 2023 fiscal year, Insider reported.

‚ÄúAs we approach the end of FY23, I want to express my sincere appreciation to everyone working hard across the company for a strong close,‚Äù Nadella wrote in the post.

‚ÄúThe innovation and creativity you continue to show have made this a landmark year not just for Microsoft, but for our customers, partners, and communities around the world,‚Äù he added.

The rosy message came despite mounting discord among Microsoft employees, who have been rankled by the company‚Äôs cost-cutting moves, including a May announcement that full-time employees would not receive salary hikes this year.

The company also reportedly cut back on bonuses and stock awards.

Elsewhere, a federal judge‚Äôs ruling on the FTC‚Äôs bid to block Microsoft‚Äôs proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard is imminent ‚Äî with a hotly anticipated decision expected as soon as Monday. An injunction, if granted, could scuttle the deal entirely.

One disgruntled Microsoft worker received more than 250 upvotes after quipping that a ‚Äúgood way to show gratitude is to unfreeze pay raises,‚Äù according to the report.

The worker reportedly noted that top Microsoft executives responsible for the decision were millionaires.

‚ÄúHere employees take pay cuts as our company and leadership make record profits. It‚Äôs not right, no other way to look at it,‚Äù added another employee said in a comment that received more than 100 votes of approval.

A third employee lamented working long hours each day despite a halt to pay hikes and rising expenses.

‚ÄúI wonder where the record profits come from? For myself, I don‚Äôt feel privileged at all for working here,‚Äù the employee said, according to Insider.

While the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of employees who reacted to Nadella‚Äôs post gave it positive feedback, roughly half of the 130 comments written by employees were negative, the report said.

The Post has reached out to Microsoft for comment.

The company has a global workforce of more than 200,000 employees.

Microsoft shares have surged to a record high this year, driven by investor optimism over its investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The stock is up more than 42% since January.

In April, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company expected $54.85 billion to $55.85 billion in revenue in its fourth and final quarter of 2023.

Earlier this month, a leaked internal survey obtained by Insider showed that just 47% of Microsoft employees indicated they would stay with the company if they received a comparable offer from a rival firm.

The states filed their friend-of-the-court brief in San Jose, California, federal court, where the FTC in July asked a federal judge to bar Meta's acquisition of Los Angeles-based Within. Facebook last year agreed to buy private company Within, developer of the popular virtual-reality based fitness app Supernatural.

""Meta's acquisition of Within may substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly by eliminating both perceived and actual potential competition,"" the states said in their amicus brief, which was pending a court's submission approval on Tuesday. The states, joined by the District of Columbia and Guam, said the deal threatens to ""harm competition in the emerging virtual reality space.""

A Meta spokesperson on Tuesday called the FTC's antitrust complaint ""ill-conceived"" and said the amicus brief from the states ""does nothing to change the fact that there is vibrant competition in the VR space.""

Meta has opposed the amicus submission as untimely, but the states' attorneys said there was no established deadline for friend-of-court filings.

The New York Attorney General's Office did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment, and neither did a spokesperson for the FTC.

Meta has denied the FTC's allegations and urged U.S. District Judge Edward Davila to deny the agency's bid for a preliminary injunction and to dismiss the complaint.

New York is leading a separate antitrust lawsuit against Meta over its purchase of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, and its purchase of WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.

Lawyers for New York in September asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to revive the states' claims after a U.S. district court judge dismissed the case.

Utah, which also signed the amicus brief, is leading a group of states in an antitrust lawsuit challenging how Google runs its app store.

Google has denied the states' claims, saying that Google Play provides openness and choice that other platforms simply don't.""

The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Meta Platforms Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 5:22-cv-04325.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File)

CLAIM: A video shows a ‚Äútop-secret military stealth plane‚Äù at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas that was visible on Google Maps, but was removed by the company.

AP‚ÄôS ASSESSMENT: False. Military and mapping experts agreed that the image, which appears to show the outline of an invisible aircraft, is not evidence of a ‚Äútop-secret military stealth plane,‚Äù attributing it instead to a normal technical flaw in Google‚Äôs process for making high-resolution 3D maps. The image was created using this process, which involves stitching together multiple images, a company spokesperson told The Associated Press. The plane is visible on Google Maps when the program‚Äôs ‚Äúglobe view‚Äù feature is turned on, and on Google Earth.

THE FACTS: A video said to show an invisible military aircraft at an Air Force base just outside Abilene, a city 150 miles (241 kilometers) west of Fort Worth, Texas, has spread widely on social media in recent days.

The video shows an overhead image of Dyess Air Force Base as someone zooms in on an image of a jet and another more transparent object that resembles a jet. Text overlaid on a second image of a plane, which is not from either Google Maps or Google Earth, states that the probability of ‚Äúseeing an invisible military aircraft‚Äù is a miniscule percentage. Google Earth is a service similar to Google Maps typically used for online exploration rather than navigation.

‚ÄúTop-Secret Military Stealth Plane Spotted on Google Maps at Dyess Air Force Base in #Texas,‚Äù a popular Instagram post featuring the video claimed. ‚ÄúShortly After, Google Maps Has Been Updated w/o the Plane.‚Äù The post had received nearly 239,000 likes as of Thursday.

Earlier versions of the video, and similar ones, posted on TikTok have collectively received more than 1.9 million views.

But Google spokesperson Abigail Jaffe attributed the presence of the alleged aircraft to how the company creates images for Google Maps and Google Earth.

‚ÄúIn order to show high-resolution 3D imagery, we stitch together a variety of available images, taken at varying resolutions and times,‚Äù she told the AP in an email. ‚ÄúDuring this process, traces of large moving objects, like planes on a tarmac or in the air, can sometimes remain after the images are layered together. When this happens, we make updates using other available imagery from providers.‚Äù

A 2020 post on a blog run by Google explains that this process is called photogrammetry and that ‚Äúsometimes the way the images are collected can create optical illusions.‚Äù Images come from groups such as state agencies, geological survey organizations and commercial imagery providers, according to the post.

The anomaly at Dyess Air Force Base is visible on both Google Maps and Google Earth at the same coordinates.

Howard Veregin, the Wisconsin State Cartographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison‚Äôs State Cartographer‚Äôs Office, agreed that the image can be attributed to a normal technical flaw in Google‚Äôs digital map-making process, and is not evidence of an invisible plane.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs safe to say that the apparent ‚Äòstealth vehicle‚Äô is an artifact of the delay between the acquisition of several different kinds of data used to make Google Earth maps,‚Äù he wrote in an email to the AP.

Veregin also pointed out that other examples of ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù objects, such as cars, can also be seen in Google‚Äôs imagery near Dyess Air Force Base.

Gary McLeod, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation who specializes in military and space issues, told the AP that actual stealth military aircraft ‚Äúare primarily designed to be low observable to high-frequency radar sensors,‚Äù rather than invisible to the human eye.

‚ÄúIf the stealth aircraft flies over the radar, at some point it will be close enough to be detected by the radar, but it will be too late for the defenses to engage it,‚Äù he wrote in an email. ‚ÄúStealth aircraft also suppress the engine exhaust signature so that infrared sensors cannot detect the aircraft.‚Äù

McLeod added: ‚ÄúIf the plane was being developed under a classified program (such as a stealth program), it is highly unlikely that it would be left unprotected and out in the open during the day.‚Äù

From 2016 to 2021, roughly a third of 90 senior officials FTC owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of financial disclosures on Thursday.

Additionally, a quarter of the top officials were invested in big tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet and Meta, even as the sector came under heavy regulatory scrutiny over potential antitrust concerns.

One former FTC chairman, Joseph Simons, owned shares of Microsoft, Oracle and AT&T even while agency investigated the tech and telecoms sectors, the report said.

The FTC and the officials named in the report said all of their stock trades followed the law, as well as ethics rules for federal employees, and they have not been accused of wrongdoing.

However, the report raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest at the agency, which is charged with protecting American consumers from monopolies, economic cartels, and shady business practices.

Kent Cooper, a former government official and expert on ethics issues, told the Journal that although the officials' stock trades are in legal compliance, even the appearance of a conflict 'hurts the reputation of the agency and the government in general.'

'Are these decisions being made for the benefit of the public or the officials who have a personal benefit in the outcome?' he said of the questions the disclosures raise.

The newspaper's analysis was based on financial disclosure forms of about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees at 50 agencies.

It found that FTC officials, on average, were more active in trading individuals stocks than any other large agency included in the analysis.

An FTC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com, but the agency told the Journal that it has a 'robust ethics program' and follows the rules set by Congress and the Office of Government Ethics.

Simons, the FTC chairman from 2018 until January 2021, disclosed more than 1,300 trades during his tenure, though less than a dozen were in individual companies, rather than funds.

Simons sold shares of AT&T, Charter Communications, and Oracle during his time as chair, but held on to a stake in Microsoft, which increased 140 percent in value over his tenure.

Randolph Tritell, who recently retired as head of the FTC‚Äôs Office of International Affairs, reported more stock trades than any other FTC official in the review.

Since 2016, he reported more than three dozen trades in shares of Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle.

In one case, Tritell saw an 80 percent gain in his Amazon shares over nine months, due to well-timed trades, as the European Commission investigated whether the company violated antitrust rules.

Tritell said that his financial advisor handles his stock trades, and that he rarely provides any input.

Abbott Lipsky was named acting director of the FTC‚Äôs Bureau of Competition in February 2017 and later that year reported owning nearly 90 individual stocks, some of which were in a family trust.

In May 2017, Lipsky reported buying between $1,001 and $15,000 in JPMorgan Chase, adding to holdings in the company that he already owned, disclosures showed.

Just seven weeks later, on June 29, FTC antitrust regulators cleared an acquisition involving JPMorgan.

Federal ethics rules contain exemptions that allow the trading of individual stocks, and the FTC officials say that all of their trades followed guidelines.

An investment of up to $15,000 in an individual stock, or $50,000 an industry-specific mutual fund or ETF, isn‚Äôt deemed a conflict of interest under federal regulations.

The report comes as stock trading by members of Congress and their immediate family members comes under renewed scrutiny by ethics experts.

In July, some stock trades executed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, drew attention when he sold his shares of chipmaker Nvidia days before the House was expected to consider a massive stimulus bill to boost the US semiconductor industry.

Paul Pelosi sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia for about $4.1 million, suffering a loss of $341,365, according to financial reports.

Democrats have proposed legislation to regulate stock trades by members of Congress, but Republicans and even some Democrats say the measures do not go far enough to prevent conflicts of interest.

            In an early summer Merger Monday for champions, no less than three major acquisitions were announced in early Monday trading.

In the first deal, US supermajor Chevron said it will buy driller PDC Energy in a $6.3 billion all-stock deal, allowing Chevron to expand its holdings in shale basins in Colorado and West Texas. Chevron will pay $72 a share, a roughly 14% premium on a 10-day average based on May 19 closing prices. Based on Chevron‚Äôs May 19 closing price, PDC shareholders will receive 0.4638 shares of Chevron for each PDC share. The deal is expected to close by year-end, pending regulatory approval and PDC shareholder approval.

The total enterprise value of the deal including debt is $7.6 billion. Chevron said it expects the tie-up to add about $1 billion in annual free cash flow at $70 per barrel Brent oil and Henry Hub natural gas at $3.50 per thousand cubic feet. Morgan Stanley and Evercore advised Chevron, while JPMorgan advised PDC.

‚ÄúPDC‚Äôs attractive and complementary assets strengthen Chevron‚Äôs position in key U.S. production basins,‚Äù Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said in the statement. ‚ÄúThis transaction is accretive to all important financial measures and enhances Chevron‚Äôs objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon.

Oil and gas producers are flush with cash after raking in record profits over the past two years, leaving the US energy patch ripe for a takeover boom. Companies are looking to bulk up and consolidate, particularly in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most prolific US shale play.

The second major deal will see Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment and Fortress Investment Group buying 90% of the equity held by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group in the US asset manager. Mubadala will own 70% of the equity in Fortress, while Fortress management will hold a 30% equity interest and a class of equity entitling it to appoint a majority of seats on the board, the firms said on Monday.

The companies didn‚Äôt disclose terms. Bloomberg News has reported that a deal that could potentially value the US asset manager at more than $2 billion. SoftBank acquired Fortress in 2017, intending to use the New York-based firm‚Äôs expertise to help manage its behemoth Vision Fund which has been a catastrophic failure.

In the third, and perhaps highest profile deal of the day, Japan's Mizuho Financial Group expanded its reach into US investment banking through a deal to buy boutique investment bank Greenhill & Co. as it seeks to accelerate growth. The Japanese banking giant agreed to buy Greenhill for $15 a share - a whopping 121% premium to Friday's closing price of $6.78 - in an all-cash transaction, which values the firm at $550 million including debt, the firms said Monday in a statement. The lender will retain Greenhill‚Äôs leaders, including Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, who will be chairman of mergers, acquisitions and restructuring.



‚ÄúThe stock as recently as February was trading right around this price,‚Äù Jerry Rizzieri, the president and CEO of Mizuho Securities USA, said in an interview. ‚ÄúRegional banks are down 40%, this stock has taken a pretty big drop,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe think we‚Äôre paying a fair price for a premium brand.‚Äù

Mizuho joins its Japanese rivals to expand investment banking tie ups in the US, however it has one-upped them by going a step further in making an acquisition. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group last month said it will expand a tieup with Jefferies Financial Group to boost US capital markets and M&A advisory businesses. Japan‚Äôs largest bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group has a more than decade-old alliance with Morgan Stanley, a deal struck in the heat of the 2008 financial crisis.

According to Bloomberg, the deal gives Mizuho another 370 employees, and Greenhill will continue to operate in 15 locations around the world. Most locations overlap with Mizuho‚Äôs existing locations except Melbourne and Stockholm, according to Rizzieri. Mizuho plans to complete the transaction by the end of the year, and the Greenhill business will be within Mizuho‚Äôs larger dealmaking division run by Michal Katz, head of banking in the Americas.

Mizuho is betting the takeover will complement its investment banking teams. ‚ÄúWe only recently began hiring M&A bankers in the last few years,‚Äù Rizzieri said. ‚ÄúMizuho offers a full complement of products ranging from debt, equity, capital markets, derivatives, fixed income and equity sales and trading, securitization. The piece that‚Äôs been missing has been M&A,‚Äù he said.

Mizuho‚Äôs takeover ends a nearly two-decade run in public markets for Greenhill, an early boutique investment bank to go public in 2004 under its iconic founder, M&A veteran Bob Greenhill. Bok was tapped to co-lead the firm three years later, and became sole CEO in 2010. The stock traded at more than $81 per share at the end of that year.

In the past decade, Greenhill faced competition from a proliferation of boutiques, with Moelis & Co., Houlihan Lokey Inc. and PJT Inc. also among those going public.

According to a new report from Axios, Bloomberg is looking to expand his media empire and would prefer a Dow Jones acquisition due to its all-encompassing business coverage. The report said, however, that he would be willing to purchase The Washington Post if Bezos were willing to sell.

The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment, while a News Corp spokesperson declined to comment on the report.

Dow Jones is ultimately owned by News Corp's (NWSA) Rupert Murdoch, who is himself reportedly considering a recombination of Fox (FOXA) and the mass media and publishing company.

According to an October report from Murdoch-owned The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the 91-year-old businessman is in early discussions to rejoin the two entities of his media empire, which formerly split in 2013. Disney acquired the bulk of Fox's entertainment assets in a $71 billion deal back in 2019.

The WSJ report added that both companies have established special board committees to study a possible deal and evaluate potential financial terms.

Bloomberg, the Axios report said, believes the recombination will fail, thus creating a possible opening, although Bloomberg has reportedly not yet spoken to Murdoch about his interest.

Media mergers and acquisitions have been on the upswing, with major corporations like Paramount Global (PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently completing their own respective consolidations. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) closed its $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios in March.

Lack of cash and increased competition have served as catalysts to the recent activity, with many conglomerates searching for new revenue drivers and monetization opportunities.

""It's a pretty good inflection point,"" Jon Christian, EVP of digital media supply chain at Qvest, the largest media- and entertainment-focused consulting company, told Yahoo Finance. ""The game has changed. It used to be just subscribers at all cost ... but now [investors] need these services to be profitable.""

Bart Spiegel, partner of global entertainment & media deals at PwC, added: ""We're entering a chapter two of the streaming wars.""

""Only time will tell, but I think everything's on the table to try to improve profitability and make the platforms more creative to their overall business,"" Spiegel continued.

Other possible acquisition targets in 2023 and beyond include the embattled Warner Bros. Discovery.

Lionsgate's film and TV studio, which the entertainment giant plans to spin off into a separate company, will also be for sale, while AMC Networks (AMCX) continues to undergo a restructuring that could result in an acquisition.

Needham's Laura Martin wrote in a recent client note that Paramount could be attractive to unload, while smaller players like WWE (WWE), Curiosity Stream (CURIW), and Chicken Soup for the Soul (CSSE) will likely sell due to their respective sizes.

Disney CEO Bob Iger, who returned to the media conglomerate to much fanfare in November, will also face a slew of decisions ‚Äî including what to do with notable assets like Hulu (sell it to Comcast?) and ESPN (spin it off?)

Wojcicki has been a part of Google since the company‚Äôs beginnings in 1998 ‚Äî it was in her parents‚Äô Silicon Valley garage that Larry Page and Sergey Brin began building the search giant. Brin later married her sister, and Wojcicki stayed with the company, rising through the ranks and holding a number of major roles before being appointed head of YouTube in 2014.

Wojcicki is leaving to spend more time with her family and focus on her health and personal projects, according to a letter she sent to employees that was posted on YouTube‚Äôs corporate blog. She will be replaced by Neal Mohan, YouTube‚Äôs head of product, who first came to Google through the company‚Äôs acquisition of advertising tech platform DoubleClick in 2008.

Her departure is a major changing of the guard for Google. Wojcicki was seen by many Google employees as more or less a member of Brin and Page‚Äôs family, given her long relationship with them and status as one of the company‚Äôs founding employees. Her name was floated by some as a potential future CEO of all of Google, given her ties to Brin and Page and long tenure.

Wojcicki was also one of the most prominent women in the tech industry. With Mohan taking over, the CEOs of all the major social media and entertainment platforms ‚Äî Twitter, Facebook, Snap, Netflix, Disney and YouTube ‚Äî are now all men.

Wojiciki‚Äôs departure follows a string of other high-profile leaders who have left big technology companies at a time when the industry is struggling to diversify its workforce. Earlier this week, Meta Chief Business Officer Marne Levine announced she would be leaving after 13 years at the company. Last year, former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg announced she was stepping down after a 14-year stint at the social media giant.

Wojcicki oversaw tremendous growth, taking YouTube from around a billion users to the over 2 billion people who use it monthly today. During that time, the unit was one of Google‚Äôs most important revenue growth drivers, going from $3.6 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018, when the company first broke out YouTube‚Äôs financial numbers, to nearly $8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

But Wojcicki had her critics, too. Wall Street analysts sometimes pointed out that YouTube‚Äôs revenue per user was significantly lower than competitors like Facebook. YouTube has also faced years of criticism for how it deals with hate speech, misinformation and conspiracy theories on its platform. In the lead-up to the pandemic, anti-vaccine influencers had grown popular on the platform, and the site had become a key part of the ecosystem of vaccine skeptics that exploded when covid-19 began spreading around the world.

Wojcicki also made the decision, along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, to ban Trump from the site following the Jan. 6 attacks. When Facebook said earlier this year it would rescind its ban on Trump, the focus swung to whether YouTube would do the same. YouTube‚Äôs ban remains, for now.","YouTube‚Äôs Susan Wojcicki steps down, leaving Big Tech with no female CEOs",non-causal,CEO,['UAE'],['APD'],['CEO'],"['CEO', 'APD', 'UAE']",-0.9990397

 Buffett has been known to invest during difficult periods for the market, famously buying a stake in Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis and in Bank of America when that bank ran into trouble a few years later. Here is history on Buffett's involvement with banks and current holdings in his investment portfolio, via his firm Berkshire Hathaway.

 

 BUFFETT ENGAGEMENTS WITH BANKING

 

 Berkshire began investing in Wells Fargo & Co. in 1989, building an eventual $32-billion stake, but exited that stake in the first quarter of 2022 amid a series of scandals for the bank.

 

 Berkshire injected $5 billion into Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in September 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis in a vote of confidence for the Wall Street bank. The investment gave Berkshire preferred stock that paid a 10% along with warrants to pay $5 billion for 43.5 million Goldman shares at $115 each.

 

 Berkshire invested another $5 billion in Bank of America in August 2011, when investors feared that the bank could run short of capital because of losses from litigation and its mortgage business following the disastrous acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp.

 

 That investment gave Berkshire preferred stock with a 6% dividend and warrants to pay $5 billion for 700 million Bank of America shares at $7.14 each; Berkshire later made a $11.5 billion profit on that investment in 2017, not including the dividend payouts.

 

 The following are Berkshire's disclosed holdings in U.S.-listed banks and financial services companies as of Dec. 31, 2022:

 

 Ally Financial Inc. - $729 million

 

 American Express Co. - $22.4 billion

 

 Aon Plc - $1.32 billion

 

 Bank of America Corp. - $34.2 billion

 

 Bank of New York Mellon Corp. - $1.15 billion

 

 Citigroup Inc. - $2.5 billion

 

 Globe Life Inc. - $766 million

 

 Jefferies Financial Group - $15 million

 

 Markel Corp. - $616 million

 

 Marsh & McLennan Cos. - $67 million

 

 MasterCard Inc. - $1.39 billion

 

 Moody's Corp. - $6.87 billion

 

 Nu Holdings Ltd. - $436 million

 

 US Bancorp - $291 million

 

 Visa Inc. - $1.72 billion

 

 

 OTHER MATTERS

 

 Bank of New York Mellon Corp. is listed as trustee under an automatic shelf registration that allows Berkshire to periodically sell debt securities. Berkshire owns about 20% of American Express Co. It has an agreement with the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep the stake passive, meaning Berkshire will not seek to influence how the company operates, an agreement dating from 1995.

 

 Berkshire has financial services investments in other countries. They include stakes in Brazilian digital lender Nubank, whose U.S.-listed shares are known as Nu Holdings, and more than 5% stakes in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. and Sumitomo Corp.",Warren Buffett Likely Eyeing Financial Investments,causal,"US, WITH","['BG', 'FSTR', 'S', 'B', 'L', 'CVX', 'OR']",['BG'],"['WITH', 'US']","['BG', 'FSTR', 'S', 'B', 'L', 'WITH', 'CVX', 'OR', 'US']",-0.9999751

It‚Äôs unclear how much Apple paid for Mira, which raised about $17 million in funding to date. Jony Ive, Apple‚Äôs former design chief, was an advisor to the startup at one point, according to two former employees who requested anonymity to speak without the company‚Äôs permission.

1. The market crash could finally break Big Tech's addiction to subscriptions.

Paying for things with a subscription has become the norm, in our personal and work lives, Paayal Zaveri writes. But it is not always the most consumer friendly. In the business world, companies want to know exactly what they're paying for and why, especially during a downturn.

That's why industry experts told me usage-based pricing, or paying for only what you use, has gained ground. The market crash could push this to become even more popular.

Even if companies don't totally abandon subscriptions, they'll have to introduce some element of usage-based pricing, Tien Tzuo, CEO of billing-management company Zuora told me.

Many hope usage-based pricing is a positive change that forces software companies to earn customers' business each month and could break tech's reliance on subscriptions ‚Äî maybe finally bringing some innovation back to how we pay for software.

The Michigan Strategic Fund approved the grant during its Tuesday, March 28, board meeting. Funding will be awarded to the Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance for land acquisition, site development and wastewater upgrades.

‚ÄúThese kinds of activities are a critical component of our state‚Äôs overall strategy to develop more invest-ready sites to attract and retain generational projects that will create good paying jobs and provide greater opportunities for local small businesses, schools and communities,‚Äù said Michigan Economic Development Corporation CEO Quentin Messer.

Ford Motor Company plans to produce lithium-iron phosphate batteries at the plant dubbed Blue Oval Battery Park Michigan. The average salary for plant workers will be $45,000, according to estimates shared with lawmakers.

Related: Michigan could spend another $750M on Ford battery plant in Marshall

A patchwork of state incentives exceeding $1.7 billion have been awarded to the project.

Michigan gave Ford a $210 million grant and a Renaissance Zone tax break valued at $772 million plus a $36 million loan to the Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance. Additionally, a supplemental budget bill allocated $630 million for site preparation in Marshall.

The new $120 million grant comes from the state‚Äôs economic development fund called the Strategic Outreach and Attract Reserve Fund, created in 2021 to attract big business investments. The supplemental bill signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer earlier this month deposited another $170 million into the SOAR fund.

The grant dollars will be used to repay the loan to the Marshall economic development group.

Michigan used these incentives to win the Ford plan in a ‚Äúhighly competitive process,‚Äù according to Terri Fitzpatrick, chief real estate and global attraction officer for the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.

‚ÄúOne of the most important considerations in determining a location is state or condition of site readiness. Michigan was competing against other states and countries with shovel-ready sites and aggressive incentive offerings,‚Äù she said.

The Ford plant will cover 950 acres of a 1,900-acre Marshall mega site earmarked by the state for development. Fitzpatrick said all the land for the Ford project has been acquired from property owners.

A chorus of voices have pushed back on the Marshall plant raising concerns about environmental risks, destruction of historic farmsteads and transparency issues. Twelve people addressed the Michigan Strategic Fund board Tuesday to express their opposition.

‚ÄúI understand that you are tasked with helping Ford find incentives to maintain jobs in Michigan. But I maintain having a huge battery plant move into our small town will not accomplish these goals,‚Äù said Marshall Township resident Linda Smoot.

Opponents have proposed preserving the swath of farmland north of the Kalamazoo River by turning it into a state park.

Victoria McGuffin, a Michigan State University chemistry professor who has lived in Marshall Township since 1985, urged the state economic development board to ‚Äúwithhold financial support‚Äù of the plant.

‚ÄúThere are many other properties in Marshall Township and Calhoun County that are more suitable for this kind of venture and do not pose this environmental risk,‚Äù she said.

Related: ‚ÄòAt what cost?‚Äô Michigan communities fight mega sites despite promise of jobs

Ford has pledged to put 245 acres along the Kalamazoo River into a conservation easement to protect the land from future industrial development. No buildings on site were classified as historical, according to Fitzpatrick.

The Michigan Strategic Fund Tuesday OK‚Äôd funding for two other major auto investments.

BorgWarner, a global automotive auto supplier headquartered in Auburn Hills, was awarded a $1.86 million grant to support a $20.6 million expansion in Michigan.

The investment into three facilities will support electric vehicle product development and testing at the $11 billion, multi-national company. BorgWarner plans to pour $5 million into its Auburn Hills location, $5 million in Dearborn and $10.6 million in Hazel Park ‚Äì creating 186 jobs in total.

‚ÄúThe company will be designing and testing automotive solutions,‚Äù Messer said. ‚ÄúAnd Michigan is an attractive option for the project thanks to the automotive industry‚Äôs robust and legendary presence in our state. This project also represents the first semiconductor firm to create and expand an integrated circuit design team in the state.‚Äù

Michigan also gave AyDeeKay, a semiconductor company based in California, a $10 million grant to land its $12.5 million investment in Michigan. AyDeeKay plans to develop an engineering design center at its existing location in Auburn Hills creating up to 180 jobs.

The theme of the keynote was high-performance and adaptive computing to help solve problems. On-stage guests included representatives from HP, Intuitive Surgical, Lenovo, Magic Leap, and Microsoft. It also included a former NASA astronaut for a bonus.

Dr. Su made seven key product announcements spanning energy efficient PCs to extreme processors designed for supercomputers. With all the announcements and guests, it‚Äôs no wonder the keynote ran significantly longer than planned. It seemed that every group in AMD got a piece of the keynote.

Despite the current slump in PC sales, most of AMD‚Äôs announcements focused on PCs - both desktop and notebooks. Of particular interest was AMD‚Äôs decision to add a dedicated AI core to its new Ryzen 7040 series notebook processors. The AMD Ryzen 7040 is designed to fit into ultrathin notebooks with 15W to 45W TDPs (thermal design power) and is made using TSMC‚Äôs advanced 4nm process. The Ryzen 7040 has AMD‚Äôs most advanced Zen 4 CPU cores matched with the latest RDNA3 GPU architecture.

The Ryzen 7040‚Äôs embedded AI technology was developed by Xilinx, which AMD acquired last year. But even prior to the acquisition, AMD had engaged with Xilinx to license the technology. Xilinx developed the AI engine for its Versal ACAP adaptive computing product. The details of the Ryzen AI engine, as AMD is now calling it, are still to be revealed, but Versal AI Engines are 2D arrays of VLIW vector-vector and matrix-matrix compute engines. While AI workloads can be run on AMD‚Äôs CPUs and integrated GPUs, AMD claims that running these workloads on a dedicated AI engine is more power efficient, which is why the company has introduced it‚Äôs first in a notebook processor. Microsoft‚Äôs EVP & Chief Product Officer Panos Panay gave a great endorsement for Ryzen AI and how Microsoft plans to use it initially for Teams and for other features in the future. We encourage AMD to make access to Ryzen AI through open tool chains and APIs in addition to Microsoft‚Äôs Studio tools.

It‚Äôs great to see AMD really embracing the pervasiveness of AI in computing. AMD has GPUs and FPGAs/ACAP for AI acceleration, and now is incorporating AI technology into mainstream notebook processors. Intel will also incorporate an integrated AI accelerator in its Meteor Lake processors later this year.

AMD also brought its RDNA 3 architecture to mobile discrete GPUs by announcing the Radeon 7000M series. These new mobile GPUs can power 1080p gaming at the highest game settings and support graphically intensive content creation applications. When you combine the AMD Radeon RX 7000M series graphics with Ryzen 7000 Series processors, AMD SmartShift RSR technology intelligently distributes image rendering, upscaling, and presentation demands between APU and GPU resources to optimize performance. This capability is expected to be available in the first half of 2023.

Desktops are also getting a processor upgrade. The new Ryzen 7000 series X3D desktop processors are equipped with up to 144MB of cache and sport up to 16 cores and 32 threads. The new processors are a bit weird in that only one of the two CPU cluster chiplets in the package get the stacked memory, giving the CPU an asymmetric bias. For example, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D has one 8 core CPU chiplets without the 3D cache that can clock to 5.7GHz with boost, but the other 8 core chiplet in the processor with the stacked 3D cache have more cache memory but a lower boost clock. It will be interesting to see how well the OS thread manager and application developers handle such an asymmetric configuration.

The other PC-related announcements include a high-power Ryzen 7045HX notebook processor design for larger laptops, aimed at gamers and creative professionals. This processor uses the chiplet design from the desktop part to deliver as many as 16 cores.

There was also a low-key announcement of AMD Ryzen 7000 Series desktop processors coming soon. Built on the Zen 4 architecture and featuring a 65W TDP, this new lineup of Ryzen 7000 Series processors is optimized for both efficiency and performance. There are some cost-optimized AM5 motherboards coming before the spring as well.

There were three announcements on how AMD is working to advance AI for data center applications: AMD Vitis Medical Imaging Libraries, Alveo V70 AI accelerator, and the Instinct MI300 high-performance computing accelerator.

AMD announced its Vitis Medical Imaging libraries to bring premium medical imaging products to market faster by reducing development times. These software libraries run on AMD Versal SoC devices with AI Engines to deliver high-quality, low-latency imaging for medical applications.

AMD also displayed its XDNA adaptive AI architecture in a discrete PCIe add-in card with the Alveo V70. Based on AMD XDNA with AI Engine architecture, the Alveo V70 extends pervasive AI from edge to cloud.

Xilinx FPGAs presently are used in the Perseverance Mars rover, so AMD hosted an interview with former NASA astronaut Dr. Cady Coleman. Dr. Coleman was promoting NASA‚Äôs agenda on human space travel to the Moon and eventually Mars with the Artemis program. But the broader message was about promoting STEM education and inspiring more people, including women, to follow a career in science.

Dr. Su ended her keynote with a preview of the company‚Äôs next monster GPU for high-performance computing ‚Äì the MI300- which is composed of 13 chiplets and uses both 2.5D and 3D packaging techniques. It has a total of 146 billion transistors. The MI300 offers not just GPU cores, but also includes three Zen 4 CPU chiplets in the package. The goal of packaging the CPU cores in the GPU cluster is to be able to run tasks closer to the GPU and eliminate transaction latency with the main host CPU. The CPU/GPU cluster will be supported by 128GB of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) local memory in the package. This design is similar to Nvidia‚Äôs Grace-Hopper HPC processor, which combines Grace‚Äôs ARM CPUs in the same package with the Hopper GPUs. The MI300 should ship in 2H23.

The numerous introductions during Dr. Su‚Äôs keynote showed that AMD is continuing to provide leadership products in PCs and high-performance computing.

The new lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, alleges that Google has unfairly tried to control all sides of the digital ads market, operating on both the buying side and the selling side. Google, says the DOJ, sought to be ‚Äúthe be-all, and end-all location for all ad serving.‚Äù

‚ÄúWebsite creators earn less, and advertisers pay more, than they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools that would ultimately result in higher quality and lower cost transactions for market participants,‚Äù says the DOJ lawsuit.

Google‚Äôs strategy to dominate digital ads includes acquiring rival ad exchanges and servers, notably its 2008 purchase of DoubleClick. It also included the acquisition of yield management platforms, which allowed publishers to seek better prices outside of Google‚Äôs system. Google also changed the terms of its AdX platform to prevent participating publishers from using such tools.

A Google spokesperson defended the tech giant, arguing the DOJ is attempting to ‚Äúpick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector.‚Äù

The lawsuit comes amid tough times for Google. Last week, the tech giant announced plans to lay off 12,000 employees as the wider economic downturn in the tech industry. Morale is low among Google employees, who are complaining that their ‚Äúpsychological safety‚Äù is at risk.

The networking giant is known broadly for its Talos Intelligence Group, regarded as one of the world's largest commercial threat intelligence teams. However, many may not be familiar with its depth in endpoint, email, malware, firewall, router and workload security, among other areas.

To learn more, I recently spoke with Tom Gillis, who leads Cisco‚Äôs security effort. During our one-on-one, we discussed several topics ranging from his vision as the newly appointed leader to the challenges associated with zero-trust whitewashing, the convergence of networking and security and the sprawl of point solutions for security. It was an enlightening conversation that I am eager to share, so let‚Äôs dive in.

Gillis may be in a new role at Cisco, but he knows the company well. His first tenure with Cisco began more than 15 years ago when Cisco acquired IronPort Systems, antispam and antivirus startup that he co-founded and where he managed product and outbound marketing. More than a decade later, he has returned to the fold after with advisory board experience as well as nearly five years managing the networking and security business group at VMware.

It‚Äôs a perfectly tailored pedigree, especially given the continued convergence of networking and security. Gillis believes that this convergence must go deeper, given the need for context and visibility to harden security and eliminate gaps that continue to plague organizations of all sizes. These gaps are no small matter, because they leave companies vulnerable to malware, ransomware and denial of service (DDoS) attacks. To achieve his vision, Gillis is placing his bets on the cloud.

Cisco Security Cloud aims to deliver an open, integrated security platform for multi-cloud environments. Provided as a service, it leverages Talos threat intelligence, Cisco‚Äôs firewall capabilities, secure access from Cisco‚Äôs Duo acquisition and more. What I like about it is the ability for an organization to eliminate many point solutions and consolidate spending for security, treating all of it as an operational expense. This approach is especially compelling for customers given recent inflationary pressures.

Security point solution sprawl is a huge challenge. In speaking with Gillis and with leaders from many other companies over the last few years, I‚Äôve heard again and again that managing dozens (or more!) of security products has become untenable. No single security platform can address it all, but sharply reducing the number of solutions can make the lives of networking and security operators much more manageable, allowing them time to focus on more value-added activities. Another bonus of a security cloud approach is that it can facilitate a legitimate zero-trust deployment. This is realized through the resulting context and policy support to authenticate users to applications, versus the limitations of a flat network.

Cisco is on the right track with its security portfolio after a few starts and stops in the past. The company delivers a good balance of coverage while making it easy for customers to acquire, deploy and manage it all. I‚Äôve been pre-briefed, and Cisco will reveal more enhancements to its security portfolio at the upcoming RSA Conference, further strengthening its value proposition.

During our conversation, Gillis told me that his mother is a pianist, his father is an engineer and he‚Äôs a mix of both. In my mind, that makes him a great conductor for Cisco‚Äôs security strategy now and well into the future.",Tom Gillis And Cisco‚Äôs Vision For Security,non-causal,RSA,[],['STLD'],['RSA'],"['STLD', 'RSA']",-0.9956015

Shares of Alphabet were in line with the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past six months (+2.3% vs. +2.4%). The company's fourth quarter results were driven by its strength in the cloud business. Solid momentum across Other Bets segment was a positive. Its robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.



Also, strong focus on AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth. The company's growing efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Its deepening focus on its wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet's expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.



However, sluggishness in the company's advertisement business remains a major headwind. Declining YouTube and Network advertising revenues are concerns.

Shares of Tesla have declined -41.3% over the past year against the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry's decline of -46.3%. The company is facing inflation and economic concerns, which could pose near-term challenges, The Zacks analyst expects Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and the introduction of new models.



Nevertheless, though Tesla witnessed a massive sell-off last year, its shares have seen a sharp rebound of late. The company's long-term prospects remain solid. The electric vehicle (EV) king is set to benefit from the soaring popularity of its Models 3 and Y. We expect deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 33% in 2023.



Production ramp-ups at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and the introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth. Additionally, Tesla's energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising. Falling debt levels is another positive.

Amgen's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past six months (+2.4% vs. +0.4%). The company beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. Amgen is rapidly advancing its robust pipeline. The acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a strategic new growth asset, Tavneos, to Amgen's portfolio.



Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio with potential new products expected to drive long-term growth. While key drugs like Prolia, Repatha and Evenity are driving sales, increasing competition for its legacy products is hurting the same.



However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen's products including some biosimilars. Increasing biosimilar competition for some legacy products and weakness in key brands like Otezla and Lumakras, create potential revenue headwinds.

Why it matters: Alphabet and its stock thrived during the pandemic. Now, an ad slowdown and its big investment in headcount are challenging its earnings growth just as it's entering a new phase of competition with Microsoft and others in AI.
‚Ä¢ ""We have significant work underway to improve all aspects of our cost structure, in support of our investments in our highest growth priorities to deliver long-term, profitable growth,"" CFO Ruth Porat wrote in a letter to investors.

Details: The company blamed an ad slowdown at YouTube for missing estimates.
‚Ä¢ YouTube advertising was down more than 7% last quarter compared to the same quarter the previous year, causing Alphabet's overall revenue growth for the quarter to drop to just 1% year over year.

Be smart: For years, YouTube has been one of Google's strongest advertising growth engines. Executives said YouTube saw a slowdown in brand ads, or ads that tout a company's reputation, and direct response ads, which push sales.

Between the lines: Like rival Meta, Google said it would take a loss of $4.2 billion, mostly in the first quarter, for restructuring costs related to severance payments to 12,000 recently-laid off employees.
‚Ä¢ It also expects to take a roughly $500 million loss related to reduced office space plans this quarter.

By the numbers, via CNBC:
‚Ä¢ Earnings per share: $1.05 vs $1.18 per share expected, according to Refinitiv
‚Ä¢ Revenue: $76.05 billion, vs. $76.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv
‚Ä¢ YouTube advertising revenue: $7.96 billion vs. $8.25 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.
‚Ä¢ Google Cloud revenue: $7.32 billion vs. $7.43 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates
‚Ä¢ Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.93 billion vs. $13.32 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates

The big picture: Despite a slowdown in ads, executives pledged to continue Google's artificial intelligence push.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúOur long-term investments in deep computer science make us extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point, and I‚Äôm excited by the AI-driven leaps we‚Äôre about to unveil in Search and beyond,"" CEO Sundar Pichai said in the company's investor letter.

            Authored by Joseph Lord via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) says he has subpoenaed the CEOs of top U.S. Big Tech firms as part of Republicans‚Äô ongoing investigation into the weaponization of the federal government.

In November, House Republicans unveiled a 1,050-page report detailing whistleblower findings from FBI agents.

Since then, the House majority authorized the creation of the House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which held its inaugural hearing on Feb. 9.

Now, Jordan has sent subpoena requests to several major tech executives asking for documents and testimony.

‚ÄúToday, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan subpoenaed the chief executive officers of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft for documents and communications relating to the federal government‚Äôs reported collusion with Big Tech to suppress free speech,‚Äù Jordan‚Äôs office said in a statement emailed to the Epoch Times.

‚ÄúThe House Judiciary Committee has repeatedly attempted to engage with the five companies since last December,‚Äù the release continues. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the companies have not adequately complied with our requests.‚Äù

Jordan was referencing a series of Dec. 14, 2022, letters his office sent to various tech executives.

The CEOs‚ÄîAlphabet‚Äôs (Google) Sundar Pichai, Amazon‚Äôs Andy Jassy, Apple‚Äôs Tim Cook, Meta‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft‚Äôs Satya Nadella‚Äîhave until March 23 to provide any communications between them and the federal government‚Äôs executive branch on the subject.

‚ÄúBig Tech is out to get conservatives, and is increasingly willing to undermine First Amendment values by complying with the Biden Administration‚Äôs directives that suppress freedom of speech online,‚Äù Jordan wrote, in excerpts from the letter to the executives posted to his website.

‚ÄúThis approach undermines fundamental American principles and allows powerful government actors to silence political opponents and stifle opposing viewpoints,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúPublicly available information suggests that your companies‚Äô treatment of certain speakers and content may stem from government directives or guidance designed to suppress dissenting views.

‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äôs role in shaping national and international public discourse today is well-known. In some cases, Big Tech‚Äôs ‚Äòheavy-handed censorship‚Äô has been ‚Äòuse[d] to silence prominent voices‚Äô and to ‚Äòstifle views that disagree with the prevailing progressive consensus.‚Äô

‚ÄúBecause of Big Tech‚Äôs wide reach, it can serve as a powerful and effective partisan arm of the ‚Äòwoke speech police.‚Äô Although the full extent of Big Tech‚Äôs collusion with the Biden Administration is unknown, there are prominent examples and strong indications of Big Tech censorship following directives or pressure from executive branch entities.

‚ÄúThese examples raise serious concerns about how and why tech companies suppress, silence, or reduce the reach of certain political speech and speakers. The collusion of Big Tech and Big Government to advance censorship undeniably undermines liberty and jeopardizes our country‚Äôs First Amendment values and protections.‚Äù

Jordan cited long-held concerns among conservatives that their viewpoints are disproportionately stifled on social media platforms through outright bans, removal of certain posts, and ‚Äúshadow banning,‚Äù which dramatically reduce a person‚Äôs reach on most social media platforms.

President Donald Trump considered the issue a concern as early as 2019, and attempted at the end of his presidency to gut the legal liability protections currently enjoyed by Big Tech platforms.

With Elon Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter and the release of documents from the platform‚Äôs previous management, it‚Äôs become clear that these concerns were well-founded, and have been proven that the firms were engaging in censorship of certain viewpoints.

Beyond large corporations, worker shortages and higher wage pressures have prompted roughly 30% of small businesses to implement new technology systems, according to a poll from Morning Consult conducted last year. Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act three months ago, creating a Fast Food Council empowered to raise minimum wages for the industry up to $22 per hour, representing an increase of over 40% from the $15.50 per hour minimum wage slated to take effect in 2023.","McDonald‚Äö√Ñ√¥s revealed a test restaurant near Fort Worth, Texas, earlier this month in which automation technology replaces many positions formerly held by employees, drawing mixed reactions from conservatives and liberals.

Under EU rules, the Dane has to take a temporary leave of absence that could be made permanent if she is confirmed as the new president of the bloc‚Äôs lending arm ‚Äî a job scheduled to start on Jan. 1 following the departure of incumbent Werner Hoyer.

‚ÄúI will take unpaid leave from the European Commission to focus on my candidacy,‚Äù Vestager said in a statement on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter.

Vestager, who is seen as one of the leading candidates to oversee the Luxembourg-based bank, with annual financing last year totaling more than ‚Ç¨65 billion ($69.7 billion). She faces stiff competition for the EIB post from Nadia Calvino, Spain‚Äôs deputy prime minister and an ex-EU competition policy official. Former Italian finance minister Daniele Franco is also considered a front-runner.

EU member nations will approve the appointment and the decision could come as soon as mid-September when the bloc‚Äôs finance ministers meet in Spain to discuss the names currently on the table.

Justice commissioner Didier Reynders will take over Vestager‚Äôs competition duties until EU commissioners break up for the European elections, which take place in June 2024. Vera Jourova, the commissioner for values and transparency, will be promoted from vice president to executive vice president, taking over Vestager‚Äôs role dealing with other institutions.

During her 10-year tenure as EU competition chief she has slapped Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google with more than ‚Ç¨8 billion in penalties for a string of anticompetitive practices related to its search business, mobile operating system and display adverts, while also calling for the company to sell its profitable advertising technology arm.

She told Apple Inc. to pay ‚Ç¨13 billion to Ireland‚Äôs government over an allegedly illegal tax break ‚Äî which Apple boss Tim Cook slammed as ‚Äúpolitical crap.‚Äù She‚Äôs also spearheaded probes into how bank traders swapped information in chatrooms.

Despite protestations from France‚Äôs President Macron and former German chancellor Angela Merkel, Vestager also blocked a ‚Ç¨15 billion railway deal between French company Alstom SA and Germany‚Äôs Siemens AG in 2019 and also stood against a ¬£10.25 billion deal between CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and Telefonica SA‚Äôs 02.

When Illumina Inc. bypassed regulatory approval from Brussels on its $7 billion acquisition of cancer-test provider Grail Inc., Vestager told it to unwind the deal and slapped the biotech firm with a ‚Ç¨432 million penalty.

After the EU was hit by successive economic crises during the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine, Vestager faced pressure from French and German governments to loosen the purse strings on Europe‚Äôs economy.

She was forced into ushering in wholesale reforms to the bloc‚Äôs state-aid framework ‚Äî allowing national governments to pump more cash into their ailing European industries, ultimately to the benefit of larger economies.

Vestager‚Äôs potential departure from Brussels also follows the rollout of new antitrust rules for the digital economy in the form of the Digital Markets Act, which lays out dos and don‚Äôts for the world‚Äôs largest tech platforms. She has also ushered through new checks and balances on foreign cash into the EU, with rules that combat anticompetitive subsidies from third countries.

Her leadership of the EU‚Äôs powerful competition portfolio was however recently tainted following a public outburst from Macron over her appointment of American academic Fiona Scott Morton to the prestigious role of the commission‚Äôs chief economist.

If unsuccessful in her bid for the EIB presidency, Vestager could find herself lacking political backing for another role commensurate with her high EU profile.

After a brutal bear market, an economic slowdown, or a recession takes place, an influx of mergers and acquisitions is one sign that business is picking up again. Why is this? When a larger company acquires a smaller company, the larger company must have the following:

1. The cash or stock on hand to complete the deal.

3. An idea that economy has turned or will be healthy enough to sustain the thought process behind the deal.

‚ÄúMerger Monday‚Äù is a term used on Wall Street to label the tendency for companies to announce large deals at the start of the week. Today, details of two potential mega-deals were announced.

Amgen Inc (AMGN), a $147 billion-dollar therapeutic company, is embarking on its largest acquisition, Ireland-based Horizon Therapeutics HZNP. While the acquisition news is not a huge surprise, there were some twists and turns in the road before the deal was agreed upon. Unless the agreement changes last minute, Amgen will buy Horizon for a whopping $26 billion or $116.50 a share (shares closed at $97 Friday).

Late last month, Zacks reported that Horizon held preliminary discussions with industry giants Sanofi (SNY), Johnson and Johnson JNJ, and Amgen. The interest from three of the biotech industry‚Äôs juggernauts sent shares of Horizon jumping 27% last month. Eventually, Sanofi and Johnson and Johnson backed out of the deal due to valuation concerns, leaving the door open for Amgen.

Both Horizon and Amgen have had positive momentum in recent years. In early 2020, the FDA approved Horizon‚Äôs biggest drug, Tepezza, a treatment for thyroid eye disease. Meanwhile, Amgen‚Äôs deep pipeline of drugs has propelled the company to earn billions in profits and outperform most of its peers. Amgen and Horizon are members of the Medical ‚Äì Biomedical and Genetics Group, a top 22% Zacks ranked group.

Pictured: AMGN (green) & HZNP (blue) have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year.

Private equity giant Thoma Bravo sees the recent tech crisis as an opportunity. Earlier today, Coupa Software (COUP) announced that Thoma Bravo would purchase the company for 6.15 billion in cash or a 30% premium to last week‚Äôs close. Coupa, a cloud-based enterprise software company, saw its shares slide this year as macroeconomic concerns and slowing growth took their toll on the software industry.

Pictured: While COUP's stock has fallen over the past year, Zacks Revenue Estimates suggest the company is turning the corner.

Despite the rough year in 2021, Zacks Revenue estimates show the company turning the corner in 2023 (revenue for the forward 12 months pictured above). Early in today‚Äôs session, investors welcomed the deal. Box Inc BOX vaulted higher by more than 7% after a JP Morgan JPM upgrade.

The four dozen exchange-traded funds and mutual funds in the Bloomberg database that have the word ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù in their description -- many of them introduced in the past 12 months -- have plunged in the bear market. The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, the biggest of them, has fallen 51% in the past year.

The declines accelerated Thursday after shares of Zuckerberg‚Äôs rechristened Meta Platforms Inc. plunged the most in eight months. The chief executive officer and co-founder asked investors to be patient with the huge investments in the metaverse even as the company reported a slowdown in its main source of income, digital advertising.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to rebrand it, it‚Äôs another thing to say, well, we don‚Äôt see substantial profits from the metaverse‚Äù for years, said Dennis Dick, head of market structure and a proprietary trader at Bright Trading. ‚ÄúInvestors in this market aren‚Äôt going to wait eight years to see substantial profits.‚Äù

The performance of the metaverse funds shows the risk of piling in to an unproven industry regardless of the price you pay: The companies that are seen as the building blocks of the metaverse -- digital worlds where users can socialize, play and do business -- are just the kind of stocks that investors are fleeing right now. Many of them have little or no earnings and sell for high valuations, with the promise of rapid growth and big profits far in the future.

The 18 metaverse funds that have been around for a year or more are down 33% to 66% over the past 12 months. Some of the stocks that are popular with the funds have gotten equally hammered: Meta is down 69%, while games company Roblox Corp. has fallen 42% and graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp. has tumbled 46%.

And fund industry heavyweights are still rolling out products, along with marketing materials to explain the sector. Allianz Global Investors introduced a fund just last week, while Legal & General Group Plc and Invesco Ltd. also have done so over the past few months.

The metaverse is still as much an idea as an actual product for many companies. But the dramatic change in the market environment means that most investors lack the stomach for long-term bets and are looking for firms with steady growth rates and tangible profits.

Even bulls consider metaverse a long-term bet. Matthew Kanterman, the director of research at Ball Metaverse Research Partners, said it‚Äôs still the ‚Äúvery early innings.‚Äù

For Meta, changing its name and ‚Äúgoing all in and investing the amount they are investing in it today‚Äù is a big commitment given that the return might not come around for 10 to 15 years, said Kanterman. That‚Äôs ‚Äúan investment cycle that is pretty much two to three times longer than the average cycle for any new product.‚Äù

Big tech firms are accruing billions in costs from exit packages as mass layoffs continue to sweep the industry.

Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet will collectively spend up to $4.7 billion on severance costs alone, earnings reports posted this week show.

Meta's severance costs totalled $975 million for the fourth quarter, but it said some of the cost will be offset by ""decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses."" Facebook's parent company axed more than 11,000 employees ‚Äî about 13% of its headcount ‚Äî in November.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post on November 9 that his decision to increase its investments ""did not play out"" the way he had expected.

Meta could see its severance cost climb higher in coming months, with growing speculation that more layoffs are likely. The company said in an earnings call this week that it ""may incur additional restructuring charges as we progress further in our efficiency efforts."" Zuckerberg also said that the November layoffs were ""the beginning of our focus on efficiency.""

Microsoft will incur costs of $800 million from severance pay, it said in its second quarter results. The company laid off around 1,000 employees in October after it ended contracts of hundreds of recruiters and others working in talent-acquisition in August. In January, it announced 10,000 job cuts, warning employees of ""times of significant change.""

Amazon's severance package spend amounted to $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. CEO Andy Jassy said on January 4 in a memo that the company would cut 18,000 jobs from across its Amazon Stores and People Experience and Technology Solutions divisions.

Jassy said at the time: ""This year's review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we've hired rapidly over the last several years.""

Alphabet expects its exit package costs to range from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet, announced the company would lay off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its global workforce, on January 20.

Pichai told employees in an email that the company had seen ""dramatic growth"" over the past two years and that it ""hired for a different economic reality"" compared to what it faces today.

Apple aficionados are buzzed about a possible debut of the company‚Äôs AR/VR headset, which has been years in the making, at WWDC 2023.

Apple‚Äôs acquisitions in the virtual reality space, coupled with the trademark filing for ‚ÄúReality‚Äù-themed names, has signaled that the Cupertino giant is up to something. Now, there are more details available than ever.

Initially meant to look like innocuous everyday glasses, the device has morphed into something ski goggle-like with a separate battery pack, Bloomberg reports. It‚Äôll run on a powerful software called xrOS, and be controlled by gaze and hand gestures.

But sleek style aside, the product apparently one-ups existing headsets on functionality, too. According to Vox, the device has a ‚Äúcopresence‚Äù feature that allows someone wearing the headset to share what they‚Äôre looking at a fellow headset user. The headset is also meant to feature exterior screens so the eyes of the wearer are visible to those in their proximity. While this might sound creepy, it‚Äôs apparently a feature meant to make the device more social and less dystopian.

Apple wants the product to become a mainstay for everything from gaming to workouts to FaceTime Calls, among other things, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, who spoke to those working on the project under the condition of anonymity.



The king of closed-loop ecosystems when it comes to tech companies, Apple intends to port several of its existing iOS apps to the new device, according to Bloomberg. Last year, a New York Times report said Jon Favreau of behind Iron Man and Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian fame will make content for the device.

The company is yet to divulge any official information.

According to Bloomberg‚Äôs Gurman, Apple has made significant investments in the headset, and it‚Äôs expecting big rewards from it, too.

$3,000: How much Apple‚Äôs headset is expected to cost. For comparison, Meta on June 1 unveiled its new-and-improved rival product Quest 3, starting at $499. But Apple‚Äôs specs are far superior. And its costing is not so exorbitant as compared to Microsoft‚Äôs $3,500 HoloLens or the $3,299 Magic Leap 2.

900,000: How many units Apple estimates it could sell a year out the gate, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Gurman. The estimate has been drastically reduced from an initial 3 million.

$25 billion: How much the headset could contribute annually to the company‚Äôs revenue eventually, according to Gurman‚Äôs reporting

The reason it fell short of earnings expectations was ""driven by weaker results in chicken, pork, and beef.""

""And our tray pack or fresh chicken business didn't materialize as we had expected,"" he explained. However, he said, ""we still have tremendous opportunity and upside as we execute this business.""

Several factors led to incorrect projections regarding the meat market in the first quarter.

Shares of DWAC were up more than 18% Thursday.

The change means that the app is now available on the app store for the 44% of smartphone users in the United States who have an Android device. Android users could previously access the platform through their web browser or through ""side-loading"" the application through the Truth Social website.

The app had previously been barred from the Google Play Store for violating Google's guidelines for moderating user-generated content.

""Apps may be distributed on Google Play provided they comply with our developer guidelines, including the requirement to effectively moderate user-generated content and remove objectionable posts such as those that incite violence,"" a Google spokesman said Wednesday.

Truth Social agreed to enforce content moderation and to remove and block users who publish posts that incite violence, according to Google.

The platform was founded by Trump after he was banned from Twitter in January 2021 ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" after hundreds of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol.

Shares of DWAC fell in early October when Elon Musk said he would buy Twitter. The billionaire has previously said that he would reinstate Trump's account. The former president had over 80 million followers on Twitter, but he has only around 4 million on Truth Social.

Investors have cited these anemic numbers among their reasons for pulling funding from the DWAC-Trump Media merger. The company lost $138 million of its $1 billion private investment after a key deadline passed in September.

DWAC is currently pushing to extend the deadline for the merger, which is currently set for Dec. 8. The company needs 65% of shareholders to approve a yearlong extension, but it has thus far failed to get adequate support. Without the extension or the completion of the merger, DWAC would liquidate Dec. 8. The shareholder vote has been delayed until Nov. 3.

The deal is also the subject of a Justice Department probe into possible securities violations relating to undisclosed discussions between the companies prior to the merger announcement. A whistleblower and founder of Trump Media and Technology Group, Wiliam Wilkerson, flagged the potential violations to the SEC.

""One way or another, this company is going to go bankrupt,"" Wilkerson recently told the Miami Herald. ""I don't think the company is going to be approved by the SEC.""

In the suit, filed in federal court in Virginia, the Justice Department alleges Google has ‚Äúcorrupted legitimate competition‚Äù in the online ad space through a ‚Äúsystematic campaign to seize control of‚Äù online tools used to facilitate advertising. Specifically, the suit alleges Google has purchased its ad tech competitors and continues to ‚Äúwield its dominance‚Äù online, forcing advertisers to use the site and ‚Äúdisrupting their ability to use competing products effectively.‚Äù Google‚Äôs alleged monopoly creates disadvantages for website publishers and other online advertisers ‚Äúwho dare to use competing ad tech products‚Äù for ‚Äúhigher quality or lower cost matches,‚Äù according to the suit. The suit, filed by the DOJ along with California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia, violated the federal Sherman Act‚Äîwhich prohibits monopolization and the attempt or conspiracy to monopolize‚Äîand seeks to break up the company‚Äôs ad tech service by forcing it to shed some of its ad business.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes, though the company has denied previous accusations that it had monopolized the digital ad space, as well as an earlier antitrust complaint that it cut out rivals through its search engine. Google argued in late 2020 that its ad tech prices had fallen in recent years, which it called ‚Äúthe hallmarks of a highly competitive industry.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoogle, a single company with pervasive conflicts of interest, now controls the technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale, the leading tools used by advertisers to buy that advertising space, and the largest ad exchange that matches publishers with advertisers each time that ad space is sold,‚Äù according to the suit.

The lawsuit is the second filed by the DOJ against Google. An October 2020 suit filed under the Trump Administration claimed Google had violated antitrust law by stunted competition in internet searches through a series of ‚Äúexclusionary practices‚Äù that have been ‚Äúharmful to competition.‚Äù That case is set to go to trial in September.

Shares of Google parent company Alphabet have fallen nearly 1.2% on the day, decreasing to $98.63 as of 2 p.m. The company‚Äôs share price has taken a major hit since peaking at $148.93 in November 2021, part of a broader decline in tech stocks.

 The news comes a day after it was learned Google Cloud is cutting back office space, forcing employees in five offices, including New York and Seattle, to report for duty on two alternate days of the week and to share desks in workstation ‚Äúneighborhoods.‚Äù

 

 Some of the 200 Everyday Robots employees and the technology will be transferred to Google Research, said Denise Gamboa, communications director for Everyday Robots.

 

 This is the latest failure for X, which also spun out a number of other busts, including Loon balloons offering internet connections, and Makani power-generating kites.

 

 Alphabet lost $6.1 billion last year on Everyday Robots and Waymo, it autonomous driving car technology now operating in test mode in three cities, including San Francisco. Each robot is estimated to have cost tens of thousands of dollars, according to robotics experts.

 

 The cuts are no surprise, as Alphabet‚Äôs profit fell 21% last year to $60 billion, primarily due to Google ad spending slowing down. While in the past, Alphabet was able to raise outside funding from venture capitalists and other investors for its subsidiaries, today‚Äôs economy is making that nearly impossible.

Last month, Alphabet announced it will lay off 12,000 workers, or 6% of its staff, which ballooned to nearly 187,000 people during the pandemic from 119,000 at the end of 2019, according to regulatory filings.

 

 Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook parent Meta, Salesforce and Snap are among other Big Tech giants making making major job cuts.

 

 X nevertheless is still betting on other cool technologies dogged by regulatory and engineering challenges that threaten their financial viability. These include Waymo and Wing grocery delivery drones.

 

 Everyday Robots was the result of a minimum of eight robotics acquisitions Google made over the past decade, with the hope that machine learning would revolutionize robotics.

 

 Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin hoped robot ‚Äúarm farms‚Äù and ‚Äúplaypens‚Äù driven by artificial intelligence (AI) rather than engineering code would breed sophisticated androids.

 

 The problem, Wired says, is that the premise worked initially for simple tasks, but the machines failed to handle subtleties or variations when responding to human commands. When asked to deal with complexities, like the type of lighting in a room or hand a person who expressed hunger something other than a bag of potato chips ‚Äî the robots malfunctioned.

 

 Eventually, Google could not determine whether Everyday Robots should pursue advanced research or create commercially viable everyday robots.

Iger said at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference the company may have hurt its image among its most loyal customers with a series of pandemic-era shifts driven by its ‚Äúzeal to grow profits.‚Äù The company recently rolled back several Chapek-approved moves to boost revenue from Disney theme parks, like charging for parking at resort hotels, charging for photos on Disneyland rides and requiring park reservations for Disney World annual passholders, which many customers viewed as nickel-and-diming moves by the entertainment giant. Iger also said Disney is looking ‚Äúvery, very carefully‚Äù at what to do with the company‚Äôs controlling stake in Hulu, giving his latest indication that he‚Äôs open to selling the platform, after Chapek repeatedly said the company planned to buy out Comcast‚Äôs stake. Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu, but it has the option to buy Comcast‚Äôs third of the platform for a minimum of $9.2 billion in January, valuing Hulu as worth at least $27.5 billion as a whole‚Äîa deal Comcast also has the option of forcing to happen if it chooses. It‚Äôs been speculated Iger‚Äôs public comments on Hulu‚Äîincluding his suggestion last month that ‚Äúeverything is on the table‚Äù for the streaming service‚Äîmay be a negotiating tactic to soften the price for a platform Comcast CEO Brian Roberts recently plugged as a ‚Äúphenomenal business,‚Äù though the $27.5 billion valuation is at the high end of analysts‚Äô estimates.

‚ÄúThe environment is very, very tricky right now and before we make any big decisions about our level of investment, our commitment to that business, we want to understand where it could go,‚Äù Iger said of streaming services.

What To Watch For

Iger said he‚Äôs ‚Äúvery bullish‚Äù on the future of the Disney+ streaming platform, despite posting its first subscriber loss since it launched in 2019 in last year‚Äôs fourth quarter. The CEO added he believes the service, currently $7.99 a month with ads and $10.99 a month without, needs a ‚Äúpricing strategy that makes sense,‚Äù as the company continues to lose money on streaming.

One of Iger‚Äôs top focuses since reassuming his CEO role in November has been on cost cutting. Disney in January announced it was laying off 7,000 workers‚Äîabout 3% of its global workforce‚Äîas part of a restructuring to cut $5.5 billion in spending. Iger has also made significant changes like reinstituting the company‚Äôs stock dividend and requiring hybrid staff to work in the office at least four days a week. Iger previously served as CEO from 2005 to 2020, overseeing a massive corporate expansion that included acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and most of 21st Century Fox‚Äôs assets. Chapek succeeded him as his hand-picked replacement, but his two-year tenure was a rocky one, which included a public spat with actress Scarlett Johansson over releasing Black Widow on streaming instead of in theaters. Chapek was also blasted for post-pandemic price hikes at Disney resorts, and faced criticism from conservatives over denouncing Florida‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù bill‚Äîafter getting blasted from the left and some company employees for supposedly taking too much time to condemn the legislation.

A month after completing his acquisition of Twitter, his iconoclastic gaze appears to be trained on the entire city. Mr Musk wants to build a super-app. Whether called ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe everything app‚Äù or ‚ÄúX‚Äù, his plans are still super-vague. A series of slides containing hardly any information tweeted on November 26th did little to shed light on his plans. Doting references to Tencent‚Äôs WeChat provide some clues‚Äîearlier this year Mr Musk described the Chinese super-app as ‚ÄúTwitter, plus PayPal, plus a whole bunch of other things, and all rolled into one with actually a great interface‚Äù. What is clear is that Mr Musk will face obstacles in his path.

A Twitter super-app would join a growing field. Launched in 2011, WeChat rode the wave of Chinese smartphone adoption. Today it boasts 1.3bn users and stunning ubiquity. Adding payments, e-commerce and gaming capabilities on top of its messaging platform made the app wildly popular. The launch of ‚Äúmini programs‚Äù, the millions of third-party applications which exist within WeChat-proper, in 2017 cemented the platform as the real operating system of the Chinese internet. There is no shortage of super-app-building across other developing economies. In South-East Asia Grab competes with GoTo, formed by a tie-up between Gojek, a ride-hailing giant, and Tokopedia, an online marketplace. Both have lost over half of their market value this year, but the concept remains a resilient one. So much so that India‚Äôs richest man, Gautam Adani, recently indicated plans to get in on the act, too.

The idea is not new. Super-app ambitions have been a staple of buzzy management presentations at American firms for years. Even Walmart touted plans to develop one. Most involve fitting as many closely related services inside the same app as possible. PayPal, a payments-giant, and Uber, a ride-hailing and delivery firm, have attempted to build narrower sector champions rather than WeChat-equivalents. These limits have not always been self-imposed. Investors have balked at attempts to push boundaries much further. When details of PayPal‚Äôs talks to take a $45bn leap into e-commerce by purchasing Pinterest, another marketplace, leaked last year, its shares plunged and the discussions were quickly abandoned. Such conglomerate-building activity would be even less acceptable to shareholders today. Mr Musk, who took Twitter private, will have no public-market investors attempting to clip his wings, but he will face more fundamental challenges if he seriously wishes to pursue a super-app strategy.

The greatest impediment to super-apps are, unsurprisingly, app stores. Apple, which makes more than half of America‚Äôs smartphones, is the incumbent gatekeeper to the country‚Äôs eyeballs. It guards this position jealously, and with good reason. The total fees it collects from its app store are not disclosed but are thought to make up a large chunk of a services segment with revenues of $78bn a year. This infrastructure, including a remarkably successful run in the payments business since the launch of Apple Pay in 2014, is the closest thing America has to a true super-app.

Mr Musk has already hit his head on this ceiling. In November he used a dispute over Apple‚Äôs advertising on his site to complain about the fees Apple extracts from apps doing business in its ecosystem (a ‚Äúsecret 30% tax‚Äù, as he put it). Mr Musk is far from the first mogul to gripe about this skimming, but it will be a particularly unwelcome squeeze on the profit margins of Twitter‚Äôs new subscription-based model. After meeting Tim Cook, Apple‚Äôs boss, at the firm‚Äôs headquarters in Cupertino, Mr Musk came away placated. But the skirmish is unlikely to be the last if Mr Musk follows through with his plans: any attempt to expand Twitter to integrate a payments system or create a platform for ‚Äúmini programs‚Äù to run within the app would ignite a more fundamental conflict. It is, however, a battle that Mr Musk would be likely to lose. Twitter will need to be far bigger before it can begin giving orders to the rule-makers. By contrast it is hard to imagine WeChat‚Äôs users abandoning the app if it was removed from Apple‚Äôs iPhones in China.

Larger platforms are more capable of becoming super-apps and of standing up to Apple. According to The Information, a news website, Microsoft has considered building its own super-app, a platform combining shopping, messaging and web search that would dip further into consumers‚Äô wallets as its business customers slow spending. Maybe Meta can rise to the challenge even as investors demand a halt to its Metaverse ambitions, the logic behind which was presumably to bypass the Apple ecosystem in the first place. Facebook‚Äôs parent company has begun to integrate the firm‚Äôs social-media properties and WhatsApp, a messaging service, is rolling out payments services in India and Brazil. Consolidation of such a sprawling estate is likely to be a quicker route to super-app success than the organic approach Mr Musk would have to take given his firm‚Äôs crippling debt burden.

Have faith in me

Another obstacle is trust. The concentration implicit in the super-app model requires trust from regulators, consumers and the developers who choose to operate their businesses within a platform. Regulators may welcome Mr Musk‚Äôs iconoclastic approach to Big Tech and the creation of another large platform. Consumers will be trickier to win over. Of all the potential cornerstones to a digital life, Mr Musk‚Äôs Twitter is hardly a compelling prospect: it is neither as vast as Meta nor as staid as Microsoft.

Persuading firms to partner with Twitter or participate in any ‚Äúmini programs‚Äù platform Mr Musk might create could be harder still. Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover of Twitter so far has come with lots of drama and erratic policymaking, which briefly spooked large advertisers. If Mr Musk is to make the transition from rule-breaker to rule-maker, he will need to defy both the business challenges to his super-app ambitions and expectations of what he might do as the boss of one.

‚ÄúGoogle has leveraged its data and acquisitions to dominate the adtech market,‚Äù Rod Rims, the former head of Australia‚Äôs competition and consumer protection agency, told POLITICO. ‚ÄúThe huge number of acquisitions that companies like Google and Facebook have made raises the question: Do you need any extra hurdles if you‚Äôre so dominant?‚Äù

The tech giants simply grew too fast over the past two decades for antitrust law to keep up. And while the U.S. is now trying retroactively to keep them in check, regulators elsewhere can now do so in advance.

For the world of antitrust officials, this shift ‚Äî known as ex ante rulemaking, or efforts to stop potentially anticompetitive behavior before it gets out of hand ‚Äî is a recognition the current enforcement system is too slow, too complex and too cumbersome to stop companies from scooping up smaller rivals or crowding out new markets before policymakers can respond in time.

In Europe, for instance, the European Commission has already fined Google roughly 10 billion euros for three separate charges of antitrust abuse dating back a decade. Yet those investigations linked to the company‚Äôs respective Android mobile software, search products and online advertising services took years to complete, giving the company time to build up an overwhelming dominance.

Alphabet ‚Äî Google‚Äôs parent company that denies any wrongdoing in its stable of antitrust cases worldwide, including the most recent charges from Washington ‚Äî also appealed Brussels‚Äô decisions, dragging out those rulings for years.

That‚Äôs why European policymakers shifted gears to create a new competition rulebook aimed at clamping down on problems before they even arise.

The goal: to create rules more akin to ongoing oversight within the financial services industry that can pinpoint potential abuse before it requires lengthy investigations. For international authorities, it‚Äôs less about dawn raids and glitzy press conferences, and more about everyday regulatory supervision to take the sting out of Big Tech‚Äôs dominance.

Here‚Äôs how it will work. Within the EU, a small number of (almost exclusively American) companies will be defined as so-called gatekeepers, or firms that hold a disproportionately dominant position within markets like search, online advertising or mobile app stores. These tech giants will then have to abide by a tougher set of rules than smaller rivals, including bans on so-called self-preferencing, or treating their own products and services more favorably compared with those of others.

That means Apple will likely have to allow people to download apps from rival online stores. Alphabet will almost certainly be forced to open up its online advertising ‚Äî and the lucrative data that underpins it ‚Äî to outsiders. And Meta must allow other messaging services to connect, directly, to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

‚ÄúLarge gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefits of competitive digital markets,‚Äù Margrethe Vestager, Europe‚Äôs competition czar, said when announcing the changes last year. ‚ÄúWhat we want is simple: fair markets also in digital.‚Äù

U.S. policymakers are well aware they are behind their international counterparts.

Stalled bipartisan legislation, known as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act supported by the likes of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), would similarly outlaw much of Big Tech‚Äôs alleged anticompetitive behavior. That would include stopping these companies from preferencing their own services over those of rivals, as well as banning current limits on how smaller competitors use the dominant services to target potential customers.

Yet even before Republicans regained control over the House last month, the new U.S. antitrust proposals had run into industry-led efforts that claimed they would harm innovation, restrict consumer choice and undermine national security. Now, expectations are that U.S. enforcers like Jonathan Kanter, head of the Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust unit, will have to work with the powers they already have ‚Äî and not bank on upgraded rules fit for the digital world.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to work with the rules we have,‚Äù a Capitol Hill staffer told POLITICO on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

Still, the new antitrust powers dreamed up in Brussels, London and Canberra aren‚Äôt the slam dunk that many of those countries‚Äô officials are hoping for. And while some in the U.S. would welcome such bespoke enforcement regimes, U.S. judges would almost certainly throw them out because existing domestic law makes it illegal to treat some companies differently from others.

In the U.K., for instance, regulators plan to create bespoke competition rules for specific tech giants ‚Äî with so-called strategic market importance, according to the upcoming British legislation that may be published as soon as the week of Feb. 13.

That follows repeated evidence from British authorities that the likes of Apple, Alphabet and Meta hold disproportionate power in the local market in everything from advertising to app stores to social media. The companies deny any accusations they have abused their dominance positions.

U.K. officials believe regulating Amazon and its e-commerce empire will require a different set of rules to overseeing Apple and its increasingly digital empire. That requires individual antitrust guardrails for each firm, or a customized playbook to keep a close tab on how each company expands.

For Brussels, whose enforcers still have a series of legacy antitrust cases into Silicon Valley‚Äôs biggest names (the likes of Meta, Apple and Alphabet deny any wrongdoing,) the shift from lengthy investigations to more hands-on daily supervision is also still a work in progress.

European officials are currently deciding which tech giants will be designated as so-called gatekeepers. EU lawyers and their counterparts at the companies are haggling over whether a firm‚Äôs entire operations or only specific services like an app store or social network should be included in the new rules, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take time to stop people thinking that‚Äôs just about investigations,‚Äù said one of the EU officials who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a new era. We have to get our heads around that.‚Äù",Washington launches a new Google battle ‚Äî with an old playbook,non-causal,EU,"['T', 'S', 'COVID', 'U']",['US'],['EU'],"['EU', 'U', 'TMUS', 'S', 'COVID', 'T', 'US']",-0.9729278

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., The Procter & Gamble Co. and Linde plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today‚Äôs research reports here >>>



Alphabet shares have outperformed the broader market this year (+36.3% vs. +18.9% for the S&P 500 index), though they have performed essentially in-line with the Zacks Tech sector. The company‚Äôs strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.



Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Also, Alphabet‚Äôs expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Its growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. We expect to hear more about the company's AI efforts on the Q2 earnings call on July 25th.



However, sluggishness in the company‚Äôs advertisement business remains a major headwind. Also, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.

Shares of Procter & Gamble have modestly outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past six months (+8.1% vs. +7.2%). The company continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Also, sales and earnings grew year over year.



The company‚Äôs organic sales grew, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. It has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. Consequently, it raised the sales view to 1% growth compared with our estimate of a 1.1% rise for fiscal 2023.



However, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation. As a result, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023. Also, an unfavorable currency has been concerning.

Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+35.6% vs. +14.9%). The company is making the world more productive by the day with wide range of applications for its industrial gases. Linde‚Äôs primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.



Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.



However, declining free cashflow is a concern, reflecting weakness in operating activities. Moreover, the company is extremely vulnerable to uncertainty associated with the slowdown of economic growth, as this could hurt demand for its industrial gases.

Artificial general intelligence, a system in which computers have human-level cognitive abilities, could be achievable within a few years, said Google DeepMind Chief Executive Officer Demis Hassabis .

Mr. Hassabis, speaking Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Future of Everything Festival, said the speed of AI research could accelerate from its already-rapid pace.

‚ÄúThe progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible,‚Äù Mr. Hassabis said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any reason why that progress is going to slow down. I think it may even accelerate. So I think we could be just a few years, maybe within a decade away.‚Äù

Researchers haven‚Äôt yet agreed on a suitable definition for artificial general intelligence, Mr. Hassabis added.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll have very capable, very general systems in the next few years,‚Äù Mr. Hassabis said.

The development of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a hot-button issue in the AI research community. While some observers have described it as a science-fiction concept, Mr. Hassabis and other executives, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have openly stated ambitions to develop the technology while safeguarding humanity from the consequences.

Google made Mr. Hassabis CEO of Google DeepMind last month, combining parent company Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs two main AI research groups under his leadership. The company said the move would accelerate its progress in AI.

DeepMind previously operated as a separate company under the Alphabet umbrella, following its roughly $500 million acquisition in 2014. DeepMind told staff two years ago that Google had called off talks about giving the company more autonomy from its parent, the Journal reported.

Last year DeepMind researchers said they had predicted the structure of nearly all known proteins using an algorithm called AlphaFold, a development that could help accelerate drug discovery. DeepMind has also worked on algorithms known as large-language models, the technology behind chatbots such as ChatGPT.

Mr. Hassabis said part of his new job was to integrate AI developments into Google products. Software programs such as computer assistants will be improved by recent advancements, he said.

‚ÄúThis next generation of assistant technology built on these types of AI algorithms will be a complete shift,‚Äù Mr. Hassabis said, comparing the moment to the debut of Apple‚Äôs iPhone.

Development of AI technology will require coordination between researchers, academics and governments on a large scale, Mr. Hassabis said, while adding that he thought Google was a responsible actor.

‚ÄúI would advocate developing these types of AGI technologies in a cautious manner using the scientific method, where you try and do very careful controlled experiments to understand what the underlying system does,‚Äù Mr. Hassabis said.",Google DeepMind CEO Says Some Form of AGI Possible in a Few Years,non-causal,"CEO, AGI, AI","['EIA', 'S', 'U']","['S', 'U']","['AI', 'AGI', 'CEO']","['AGI', 'U', 'S', 'VLO', 'CEO', 'EIA', 'AI']",-0.4790308

TD SYNNEX enables enterprise customers from 60 additional global markets, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay to gain access to its cloud experts and solution portfolio incorporated with Google Cloud‚Äôs capabilities in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, infrastructure, collaboration and many more things. This will enable the business partners to generate positive business outcomes in the cloud market. The GOOGL Cloud solutions, devices and cloud infrastructure will enable enterprise clients to create new core competencies and boost business growth.

Alphabet‚Äôs Google Cloud provides users with a suite of cloud computing services that businesses can use to enhance productivity and workflow. It comprises Google‚Äôs infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Currently, it has 29 cloud regions and 88 availability zones. With the latest move, TD SYNNEX not only strengthens its existing partnership with Google Cloud, but also increases scalability and enhances its global reach.

SNX offers extensive resources to support organizations in building cloud practices and delivering cloud offerings, including Cloud Practice Builder programs, Rapid Risk Security Assessments, Google Cloud Migration Assessments, and a growing roster of professional and managed services. Coupled with Google Cloud offerings, devices and cloud infrastructure, TD SYNNEX positions partners to grow new core competencies and accelerate business growth.

SNX continues to witness strong demand for its technology products and services. A steady IT spending environment, backed by rapid digital transformations, is its upside. During third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company‚Äôs revenues jumped 194.9% year over year to $15.36 billion. This was driven by the inclusion of revenues from 2021‚Äôs merger of Tech Data Corporation.

However, TD SYNNEX‚Äôs near-term growth prospects are likely to be hurt as organizations push back their investments in big and expensive technology products on growing global slowdown concerns amid the present macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Persistent inflationary pressure resulting to a substantial increase in component costs and wage is anticipated to hurt the company‚Äôs profitability in the next few quarters.

TD SYNNEX and Alphabet currently carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of SNX and GOOGL have decreased 14.8% and 38.3%, respectively, in the past year.

However, as the series is a product of MGM, which last year was acquired by Amazon in a multi-billion-dollar deal, reports have surfaced in recent weeks that rival streaming service Prime could land season two as its own.

However, it‚Äôs now been reported that Wednesday season two, if it‚Äôs renewed, will still have its home on Netflix. After all, Amazon had already stated that it wouldn‚Äôt be making all MGM content exclusive to its own services, according to Deadline.

Wednesday‚Äôs future has been surrounded with uncertainty not least because of the Amazon rumours but also the fact Netflix is yet to officially greenlight a second run. Season two does seem inevitable, however, given the rating figures Wednesday returned after dropping on the streamer.

Within its first week on Netflix, Wednesday racked up an incredible 341.23 million hours viewed among subscribers. This saw off the previous record holder Stranger Things season four which had accrued 335 million hours. However, this is the record for an English language series as the record for the overall series belongs to the South Korean drama, Squid Game.

The investigation is ongoing, and no decision has been made on whether to file a case or on what to include in a complaint, those three people said.

The timing of antitrust cases such as this is always shifting and often delayed. Unlike merger reviews, other antitrust cases are not subject to any time constraints. Reports that the DOJ was preparing an advertising-focused case against Google , but it took more than two more years before a lawsuit materialized. Still, the map investigation is a priority for the department‚Äôs antitrust division, and prosecutors are working quickly to reach a conclusion, the people said.

The investigation is broadly focused on Google‚Äôs control of digital maps and location data, in this instance the precise location of a host of different places, which is a key part of its search results, the people said.

A lawsuit challenging Google‚Äôs maps business would open up an unprecedented third front in as many years in the Justice Department‚Äôs antitrust war against the company.

The investigations date back to the Trump Justice Department when it opened a wide-ranging antitrust probe into every part of the company‚Äôs business in early 2019.

The DOJ and a group of state attorneys general first sued Google in October 2020, accusing the company of illegally monopolizing the online search market. That case is currently set to go to trial in September. Then in January, Google was hit with a second case from the DOJ and an overlapping group of states targeting its online advertising business.

Google is also facing an advertising-related lawsuit from a Texas-led group of states, and litigation over conduct involving its Google Play mobile app store from a Utah-led group of states. The latter is also slated for trial in the Fall.

Google‚Äôs trove of map data is often used in search queries, such as ‚Äúpizza near me.‚Äù However, Google Maps is also a key part of the underlying technology used in apps such as delivery services and ride-share companies.

The DOJ is examining whether Google illegally forces app developers to use its mapping and search products as a bundle, rather than choose competing options for different services, the people said. For example, Google has extensive data on the locations of businesses and other places, and prosecutors are examining how the company may prevent developers from using that data with a competing mapping service.

Google has said its policies are designed to improve user experience, saying that combining Google and non-Google information could cause errors and safety risks. It also says it licenses some mapping data from third parties and faces restrictions on how that data can be shared.

‚ÄúDevelopers choose to use Google Maps Platform out of many options because they recognize it provides helpful, high-quality information,‚Äù said Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels. ‚ÄúThey are also free to use other mapping services in addition to Google Maps Platform ‚Äî and many do.‚Äù

The DOJ is also scrutinizing the Google Automotive Services offering for automakers, which packages together Google Maps with the Google Play app store and the company‚Äôs voice assistant, the people said. It can be difficult for carmakers and the companies that manufacture the information and entertainment systems to mix products and services such as voice assistants offered by competing companies if they also use Google Maps.

‚ÄúThere is enormous competition in the connected car space, including an array of companies offering car infotainment systems,‚Äù Schottenfels said, including hundreds of car models supporting Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa. ‚ÄúEven if automakers choose Android Automotive OS, they aren‚Äôt required to use Google Automotive Services for their cars.‚Äù

Reuters on some parts of the DOJ investigation. Germany‚Äôs antitrust authority is Google‚Äôs mapping business.

Google‚Äôs mapping business has also faced congressional scrutiny. According to the House Judiciary Committee‚Äôs 2020 staff report on antitrust issues in the tech sector , Google is ‚Äúeffectively forcing [developers] to choose whether they will use all of Google‚Äôs mapping services or none of them.‚Äù

The government is also scrutinizing contract provisions that require customers to share app data with Google. As an example, Google requires food delivery apps to share data on customer searches and deliveries.

The House report also goes into detail on how Google built its map business through acquisitions, including its 2013 purchase of competitor Waze. Those deals could also get attention in an eventual lawsuit.

The DOJ‚Äôs advertising case filed in January focused heavily on a number of Google‚Äôs acquisitions in that sector, and is seeking to break up major parts of the company‚Äôs ad business.

Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ‚Äôs antitrust head ‚Äî and a longtime critic of Google while in private practice ‚Äî has said the largest tech companies are looking to use their various lines of business to boost their monopoly power in a core market, in this case search, as well as leverage that core market power to build dominant positions in new markets.

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen has been speaking to advisers about a possible purchase of the company, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Reata, which is also speaking to advisers, may attract interest from other suitors, according to the people.

Shares of Reata have nearly tripled this year, giving the company a market value of about $4.1 billion at Thursday‚Äôs close. They jumped as much as 15% in pre-market US trading Friday.

No final decisions have been made, and there‚Äôs no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said. Reata could opt to remain independent or pursue a partnership instead of an outright sale, some of the people said.

The Betaville blog wrote on Thursday about market speculation that Reata had attracted takeover interest. Representatives for Biogen and Reata didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.

Biogen is in transition as it attempts to broaden its focus and come up with new growth sources to replace aging multiple sclerosis drugs. Chief Executive Officer Christopher Viehbacher, who took over last year, has promised to redesign the company and reduce its dependence on risky neurology research without eliminating the ability to pursue hard diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs. Viehbacher has highlighted rare disease as an area the company wants to expand in.

Reata, based in Plano, Texas, develops drugs that target chronic and genetic neurological conditions. It received US Food and Drug Administration approval in February for Skyclarys, the first approved treatment for Friedreich‚Äôs ataxia, a rare inherited disease that can affect children as young as five and causes impaired walking and coordination.

The treatment could generate peak sales of $1.5 billion, according to Barclays Plc forecasts . A sale to a larger pharmaceutical company would give Reata more resources to successfully roll the drug out to patients.

Biogen hasn‚Äôt been the most acquisitive company over the years. In 2013, it bought the remaining stake in the multiple sclerosis medicine Tysabri for $3.25 billion in cash from its partner Elan Corp. In 2020, it acquired a minority stake in Sage Therapeutics Inc. for about $1.5 billion. Biogen‚Äôs shares have fallen about 5% this year, giving it a market value of around $38 billion.

Earlier this week, Biogen said it would cut 1,000 jobs, or more than 11% of its workforce, and reduce operating expenses in an attempt to grapple with declining sales from treatment for multiple sclerosis, its biggest drug category.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched higher by 0.07%, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked higher by 0.68%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by as much as 0.44% in premarket trading amid disappointing results from some of the U.S.'s biggest tech companies.

The downturn snapped three straight days of gains for the indices. Stocks had rallied as of late on positive signals from Federal Reserve officials concerned with the pace of the interest rate hikes ahead of their November meeting, as well as a slew of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.

But the rally ran out of steam amid two lackluster reports from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which raised concerns about slowing economic growth.

On Wednesday, shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) plunged in after-hours trading as the tech giant posted a second quarterly revenue decline.

‚ÄúLook, across the board, tech continues to miss. And they're disappointing‚Äî I think what's most disappointing are the expenses,‚Äù Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday after Meta‚Äôs earnings.

‚ÄúI think everyone wants Zuckerberg to hit the air brakes on expenditures. The fact that they're holding headcount flat is good, but I think everyone is calling for more severe measures in terms of trimming headcount, trimming expenses to get a hold of what's happening in this macro storm,‚Äù Thill added.

Wall Street is also watching for third-quarter GDP data, which will reveal how the U.S. economy fared last quarter after recording two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate that the economy grew 2.4% annual rate in July through September, while the Atlanta Fed forecasts 3.1% expansion.

Investors also digested earnings from Ford (F) that narrowed its profit forecast for the year and took hefty charge from its autonomous-driving venture Argo AI. Shares of the automaker are lower by 3% in pre-market trading.

Also on the earnings front Thursday:
‚Ä¢ None Southwest Airlines (LUV) posted results before the bell on Thursday forecasting a higher fourth-quarter revenue as travel demand still holds strong.
‚Ä¢ None Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) also posted earnings that topped expectations even with slowdown of sales growth in Asia.
‚Ä¢ None McDonald's (MCD) beat Wall Street estimates for its third-quarter earnings and revenue.
‚Ä¢ None Shares of British oil major Shell (SHEL) rose in pre-market trading after the company reported quarterly profits which more than doubled from the same period last year. The oil giant announced it would buy back $4 billion worth of shares and increase its dividend by 15%.
‚Ä¢ None And on the bank side of earnings, shares of Credit Suisse (CS) fell over 10% in pre-market trading after the Swiss firm posted a $4 billion loss as the investment bank radically restructures over the next three years.

Also on Wall Street‚Äôs plate is Twitter‚Äôs drama-filled acquisition deal. Elon Musk paid a visit to Twitter‚Äôs headquarters ahead of his Friday deadline as banks have started to send $13 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. A move indicating that the deal is on track to close.

‚ÄúThe $44 billion price tag for Twitter will go down as one of the most overpaid tech acquisitions in the history of M&A deals on the Street in our opinion,‚Äù Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. ‚ÄúWith fair value that we would peg at roughly $25 billion, Musk buying Twitter remains a major head scratcher that ultimately he could not get out of once the Delaware Courts got involved.‚Äù

The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rebounded, as the benchmark for the US yield has retreated more than 20 basis points over the past two days, while the dollar has held steady.

Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week (and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here).

Not a huge amount has been confirmed by Google about its upcoming Pixel Fold, but a double-shot of leaks this week makes things a little clearer. First up is the aspect ratio, and this is perhaps the most curious. Rather than the thin folded design of the Galaxy Z Fold or Honor Magic, Google is going for a more Surface Duo-styled double-notebook look:

""...the Pixel Fold is considerably wider and has a squarer aspect ratio than the Galaxy Z Fold 4‚Ä¶ In the past, one of the biggest design issues of the Galaxy Z Fold series was the narrow cover screen. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 addressed that problem to a reasonable degree, but it looks like Google may have gone too far in the other direction. The Pixel Fold may be too wide for a smartphone and could prove unwieldy/.""

We also have a closer look at what will be in the heart of the Pixel Fold, and this is where it gets a touch more interesting, if not mainstream. The Pixel Fold is going to come with the latest chip technology in Google‚Äôs Tensor G2 - it might not win the raw benchmarks, but the potential for machine learning will be high:

""The Geekbench 5 listing (shared by TheGalox(opens in new tab)) for an unknown ""Google Felix"" device shows results for a phone using a Tensor G2 chip, 12GB RAM and Android 13, just like the Pixel 7 Pro. It scores slightly worse than the Pixel 7 Pro in the single-core portion of the test, although it does a little better in the multi-core test.""

Not to be outdone in the leak stakes, the ever-reliable FCC‚Äôs documentation confirms the Galaxy S23 ultra‚Äôs charging and battery potential, and something is missing. Around 20 watts of fast charging:

""The FCC describes the Galaxy S23 Ultra as being capable of 25 W fast charging, a 20 W downgrade on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. With this downgrade also applying to the Galaxy S23 Plus, it seems that Samsung is not looking to distinguish between Plus and Ultra models. Instead, it has harmonised charging wattages across its Galaxy S lineup, although it is unclear why at this stage. Potentially, Samsung has dropped 45 W support because of its instability.""

Industry watchers have been expecting it for some time, but the latest handsets from iQOO have been launched, packing in high specifications alongside the top-end Qualcomm system on chip:

""iQOO revealed its new flagship line in China and Indonesia after numerous speculations and leaks. It includes the mobile devices iQOO 11 and 11 Pro. So, the Pro version adds 200W charging, along with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip from Qualcomm, a 144 Hz refresh rate screen, and the Vivo V2 ISP processor.""

Nothing Tech has cut through the smartphone market with the Nothing Phone (1) this year. Right now, this does not look like the first in a stream of smartphones, with Co-Founder Carl Paid writing on Twitter that the focus on a smaller portfolio and maximizing what is out there already:

""Phone (2) isn't launching anytime soon. We're focused on doing a few things well, and won't churn out dozens of products a year like many others. Phone (1) is our main focus. We're cooking something really great in terms of software, Android 13 and beyond.""

Following the purchase of the mapping company Waze, Google ran it as a separate unit. That‚Äôs no longer the case and the Waze team will now be part of the Android Auto experience moving forwards.

""The Geo division will absorb over 500 Waze employees, which has otherwise been independent from Google since its acquisition in 2013 and maintained a separate culture. Waze offers an Android Auto experience, though we‚Äôre waiting for it to support the split-screen redesign, while it just announced an Android Automotive app that will see wider availability next year. Meanwhile, Google services, like YouTube Music, integrate with Waze for in-app audio controls.""

There are many email solutions out there. With the purchase of K-9 Mail by Mozilla, the popular indie email client is in the process of becoming Thunderbird for Android thanks to significant engineering time and a development process taking in as much feedback as possible. This week‚Äôs feedback topic is around the messaging preview layout:

""The road to bringing you a great Thunderbird email experience on Android devices begins with K-9 Mail, which joined our family earlier this year. And we‚Äôve been busy improving K-9 Mail as we prepare its transition to Thunderbird for Android in Summer 2023. Last week we showed you the new Swipe actions in K-9 Mail 6.400. Today, it‚Äôs something even more exciting: a completely redesigned message view!""

iRobot cofounder Colin Angle ranked No. 28 on the 2022 Tech Power Players 50. See the full list here .

But as iRobot launches the new Roomba Combo j7+on Tuesday, it‚Äôs also looking over its shoulder toward Washington, where federal regulators may try to block its pending $1.7 billion acquisition by online giant Amazon.

Last week, the Federal Trade Commission asked Amazon and iRobot to provide additional details about the deal, a signal that the agency may step in to challenge the acquisition in court.

‚ÄúThis deal really does raise concerns,‚Äù said Krista Brown, senior policy analyst at the American Economic Liberties Project, an organization that favors more aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the fact that Amazon fundamentally has too much power.‚Äù

Brown is especially worried that Amazon is interested in collecting sensitive data about millions of households that use iRobot vacuums and floor mops. These machines use artificial intelligence to create data maps of the users‚Äô homes. Brown said that Amazon could combine this data with information about millions of online shoppers. This might tighten Amazon‚Äôs stranglehold on the online retailing market, Brown said.

For decades, the FTC and the US Department of Justice have applied a ‚Äúconsumer welfare‚Äù standard to the enforcement of antitrust law. Pioneered by law professor and federal judge Robert Bork, this view holds that the government should only file antitrust suits against companies when their business practices can be shown to do specific harms to the wellbeing of consumers. For example, a company with a monopoly might set its prices too high for many consumers to afford.

Under this approach to antitrust law, it‚Äôs very hard to bring cases against the big tech companies. Some, like Google and Facebook, don‚Äôt charge consumers for major products, like social networking, search services, and e-mail. Then there‚Äôs Amazon, a huge company, but not exactly a monopoly. For instance, according to PYMNTS.com, Amazon last year held 51 percent of all US online sales, and less than 10 percent of total US retail spending.

But Lina Khan, chosen by the Biden administration as chair of the FTC, believes antitrust law should be used to prevent companies from stifling competition, even if their policies don‚Äôt directly harm consumers. ‚ÄúWe should replace the consumer welfare framework with an approach oriented around preserving a competitive process and market structure,‚Äù Khan wrote in a 2017 Yale Law Review article.

Until recently, Khan wasn‚Äôt able to act on her vision, because the FTC was evenly divided between two Republicans and two Democrats. But in May, after much delay, a third Democratic commissioner was appointed, giving the Democrats a working majority.

Two months later, the FTC sued Meta, parent company of Facebook, to block its acquisition of Within, a little-known maker of virtual reality software. The FTC alleged that Facebook was trying to ‚Äúbuy its way to the top‚Äù of the virtual reality market.

Will Duffield, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, thinks it‚Äôs probable that the FTC will file a similar lawsuit to block the Amazon-iRobot deal. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a very tempting target,‚Äù he said.

But Duffield thinks such a lawsuit would be tough sledding for the FTC, because for decades courts have relied on the consumer welfare standard.

‚ÄúI think it would face an uphill battle,‚Äù he said.

IRobot chief executive Colin Angle refused to discuss the possibility of an antitrust showdown during a recent conversation with the Globe. But he was happy to talk about the Roomba Combo j7+, which uses a mopping pad that retracts into the top of the machine. The pad automatically deploys when the Roomba is mopping an area with hard floors, then lifts away to let the vacuum cleaner take over on carpeted surfaces.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an entirely new class of robot,‚Äù said Angle. ‚ÄúYou never have to worry about what gets mopped and what gets vacuumed.‚Äù

The robot will be powered by a new version of iRobot‚Äôs software, which features new abilities to recognize common household obstacles. For instance, Roombas will automatically detect items to be avoided, like backpacks or a child‚Äôs toys. But when it spots a toilet, stove, or dishwasher, the Roomba doesn‚Äôt avoid them. Instead, it cleans the floor space directly in front of them with extra care.

The idea isn‚Äôt merely to recognize household objects, but to deal with each object intelligently, as a human would. Angle said it‚Äôs a crucial step toward more advanced robots with hands capable of putting items where they belong.

‚ÄúOne day the robot will say, ‚ÄòI know what that is. I‚Äôve got to pick it up and put it away for you,‚Äô‚Äù Angle said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a little ways away, but you can see we‚Äôre on the journey.‚Äù

The United States' billionaires lost $660 billion collectively, the highest of any country by Forbes's count, as tech stock prices took a nosedive fueled by rising interest rates, soaring inflation and a worsening economy.

Of America's billionaires, Tesla, SpaceX, and newly minted Twitter CEO Elon Musk saw his fortune diminish the most. Musk's net worth dipped by about $115 billion this year, according to Forbes.

In October, when Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, he sold off about $23 billion in Tesla shares to fund the acquisition. He has since acknowledged this deal was an ""obvious"" overpayment. More recently, he confirmed his plans to step down as CEO of the social media platform once he finds a suitable replacement.

Tesla's stock price is down nearly 70% year-to-date, as of Dec. 27. Longtime Tesla investors are calling on its board of directors to get Musk to refocus on the electric vehicle company.

Although Musk lost his spot as the richest person in the world this year, he's still the wealthiest person in the United States, with a net worth of nearly $139 billion as of Dec. 27, according to Forbes.

And while Musk is ""the biggest loser of 2022,"" according to that publication, he's not the only billionaire whose net worth took a hit. Here's how much five other U.S. billionaires lost in 2022 according to Forbes.

Title: Founder and chair, Amazon

Estimated 2022 losses: -$80 billion

Net worth: $106.8 billion as of Dec. 27

Title: Co-founder and board member, Google

Estimated 2022 losses: -$40 billion

Net worth: $76.8 billion as of Dec. 27

Title: Chair emeritus , The Est√©e Lauder Companies

Estimated 2022 losses: -$9.8 billion

Net worth: $22 billion as of Dec. 27

Some high-profile moguls completely dropped off of the billionaires list in 2022. Rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, fell from the ranks after Adidas cut ties with him on Oct. 25 amid his continued anti-Semitic remarks, for example.

And Sam Bankman-Fried went from Fortune magazine cover star to potential felon. The founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform FTX, who is now charged with fraud, saw his net worth plummet by billions after FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11.

Treasury yields backed off their highs to close out the week following a Wall Street Journal report that some Federal Reserve officials are growing uneasy with the pace of the central bank's interest rate hikes.

With interest rates soaring, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday that U.S. mortgage demand has dropped to a 25-year low. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to 7.15%, its highest level since 2002.

U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned on Thursday after just a month and a half on the job. Truss' fiscal plan, which included aggressive tax cuts and investment incentives, sent the British pound tumbling to a record low against the U.S. dollar and created extreme volatility in financial markets, prompting her to reverse course and ultimately step down from her position.

The Washington Post reported Friday that influential Tesla CEO Elon Musk is planning to lay off 75% of Twitter's workforce once he completes his $44-billion acquisition of the social media platform. The same day, Bloomberg reported the Biden administration is considering a review of Musk's Starlink satellite internet service and his Twitter buyout deal on national security grounds.

Shares of Snapchat parent company Snap traded lower by 31% on Friday after the social media company reported just 6% revenue growth in the third quarter, down from 57% growth in the same quarter a year ago.

The groundbreaking was followed by a launch party to kick off the construction of 10 buildings on the site, which had been occupied for decades by the Allstate Insurance campus. The Logistics Campus will provide more than 3.2 million square feet of business space, company officials said.

‚ÄúThe story is just starting,‚Äù said Dermody Properties President Douglas A. Kiersey of Winnetka.

‚ÄúWe feel a great sense of duty to carry on the legacy of Allstate to honor tens of thousands of folks who worked here for years or perhaps decades,‚Äù Kiersey said.

Community leaders and elected officials turned out for the groundbreaking.

‚ÄúI believe that Dermody will be a good neighbor and we‚Äôll see some good results out of this campus,‚Äù Glenview Village President Michael Jenny said.

Glenview village trustees unanimously approved an Allstate land development and tax incentive package at the July 19 board meeting. The former Allstate headquarters was annexed into Glenview under an agreement with Prospect Heights.

Dermody announced Oct. 19 the official purchase acquisition of the 232-acre parcel, paying $1 million per acre.

The Logistics Campus is a planned logistics park. Dermody has started construction of five buildings totaling 1.2 million square feet, scheduled for completion in the second and third quarters of 2023. The remaining acreage has flexibility for build-to-suit applicants.

Kiersey said that Amazon, as a distribution center, is still not on the table as a potential occupant. Residents living near the site were concerned about the possibility of a 24-hour trucking warehouse type of center.

‚ÄúThat status has not changed,‚Äù Kiersey said about Amazon.

According to the Village of Glenview, the Dermody development tax return would be (from 2023 to 2040) $134.5 million shared by recipients such as Glenbrook High School District 225 ($41 million-plus) and West Northfield School District 31 (which serves Glenview) at nearly $53 million in new tax revenue.

Kiersey confirmed that Dermody intends to sell loosely four acres to the adjacent Gertrude B. Nielsen Child Care and Learning Center of Glenview.

The Gertrude B. Nielsen Child Care and Learning Center submitted an offer to Dermody last July 19 to purchase the acres of land east of the learning center along Willow Road and next to the center‚Äôs playground.

Originally, the 3.89 acres were considered for a gas fueling spot by Dermody but became residential zoning.

Once the sale is closed, the learning center, which has a nearly 35-year history, would consider uses such as outdoor classroom space and a teaching garden, as examples.

While the learning center contract amount has never been revealed by either party, Kiersey indicated the public domain value for the Allstate land is $1 million per acre.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our intent, we‚Äôre trading documents, we haven‚Äôt quite got everything tied up, but that‚Äôs their expectation and our expectation,‚Äù Kiersey said, of honoring the land sale to the child care center.

As part of the deal with Prospect Heights, Lake Michigan water will be sold from Glenview to Prospect Heights.

Glenview gets its water from Wilmette and Glenview officials have confirmed that Wilmette officials are aware of the potential wholesale water resale intention.

‚ÄúIt was good foresight by prior administrations and village staff to provide the infrastructure to the water main hookup to this property,‚Äù Jenny said on Thursday.

Dermody Properties Midwest Partner Neal Driscoll of Wilmette said about the water, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty tremendous.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the biggest benefits of this whole relationship to the communities is their ability to work out that water agreement,‚Äù Driscoll said.

During the program, a $10,000 donation was presented from Dermody to the Northfield Township Pantry based in Glenview.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a show of good faith,‚Äù said Northfield Township Supervisor Shiva Mohsenzadeh of Glenview.

The pantry was recommended as a donor recipient by Village of Glenview trustees, said Dermody Properties Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Michael C.

We‚Äôve contacted Alphabet for confirmation and will update this story if we hear more details about the exact number of jobs affected.

Alphabet has been cutting costs this year, with Google laying off approximately 12,000 workers in January. That same month, another Alphabet robotics venture, Intrinsic was also hit by a roughly 20 percent cut to its headcount, or around 40 employees.

Everyday Robots launched in 2019, with an aim of designing armed robots that could help out in domestic and office settings; taking on light custodial work like sorting trash and cleaning tables. The project‚Äôs prototype, single-armed, wheeled robots were tested in Google‚Äôs offices from 2021, and in 2022 received an upgrade courtesy of Google‚Äôs AI language research, letting them process natural language commands.

You can see the robots in action in the demo video below:

However, building robots that can take on such work in unstructured and unpredictable environments like offices is notoriously difficult. After decades of research and huge success in the creation of industrial robots, we‚Äôve only really managed to conquer one domestic task using mobile machines: vacuum cleaning. (Are regular appliances like dishwashers robots? You can argue that one out in the comments.)

It‚Äôs a disappointing end for another of Alphabet‚Äôs ambitious hardware ventures. A decade ago, Google embarked on a robotics acquisition spree, buying numerous companies like Boston Dynamics. However the initiative was led by exec Andy Rubin, who left the company the following year after being accused of sexual misconduct while reportedly under the protection of Google‚Äôs leadership.

It's a bird! It's a plane! It's the 11 biggest US banks to the rescue!

Did you feel that? That's the weight of the biggest banks in the country putting their proverbial foot down.

The largest US banks ‚Äî headlined by Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo ‚Äî just pledged a total of $30 billion in deposits to First Republic Bank.

The move was made to not only stabilize First Republic Bank ‚Äî which recently saw its credit rating downgraded as its share price dropped and clients pulled money ‚Äî but also to show confidence in the wider banking ecosystem.

As detailed in a release announcing the news, the 11 banks, which also included Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, believe the move ""demonstrates their overall commitment to helping banks serve their customers and communities. Regional, midsize and small banks are critical to the health and functioning of our financial system.""

It's a fitting end to what was one of the wildest banking weeks in recent memory. What started off with a crisis focused on a specialized, albeit powerful bank, eventually spilled out to regional banks across the country.

While the move should calm the markets, it's not a long-term solution, per se. The money is committed to First Republic for at least 120 days, which puts us at about mid-July. I can't imagine the big banks looking to pull the rug out from First Republic four months from now, but this money was a deposit, not a donation.

As Insider's Hayley Cuccinello reports, First Republic's problems are far from over. The deposits are moreso a lifeline, not a fix-all.

I also wonder what this means for Silicon Valley Bank. (Remember them?) The bank, errr the FDIC, is still looking for a buyer. But now that some of the potential buyers have all pledged significant capital to First Republic, I wonder if that diminishes its chances of getting acquired.

Read more about how big banks came to the rescue of First Republic with $30 billion in deposits.

But here's why it's not smooth sailing for First Republic.

It's no wonder the European Commission wants AI companies warning their users that the content they generate can lead to disinformation.

Not to be outdone, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wants his own government to play a leading role in the international regulation of AI. Meanwhile, the top AI adviser to US President Joe Biden left the administration on Thursday -- just as the White House is weighing how to grow and police the technology.

In a Bloomberg TV interview, Todd McKinnon, the chief executive officer of software company Okta Inc., said it's ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù for AI regulation anyway, warning that restricting the technology without fully understanding it is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and could allow other countries to win the race. The head of Scale AI similarly said the US risks losing its edge to China.

Meanwhile, OpenAI Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman continued his world tour with a stop in New Delhi where he said governments should actually be funding AI efforts and integrating the technology with their services. During another stop in Abu Dhabi, he said he isn't interested in taking his startup public because he wants to maintain full control over the technology.

Maybe he's missing out: The AI frenzy has catapulted the warehouse robotics firm Symbotic Inc. to become the top performing company that went public through a SPAC merger in the past five years.

Cord cutting, a trend begun one decade ago is escalating. Streaming video, an alternative to cord cutters, has had a financially difficult third quarter. With churn rate (the percentage of customers ending their subscription) reaching an all-time. As a result, in fourth quarter media companies announced a series of layoffs, cutbacks and restructuring impacting thousands of employees

At a time when consumers are concerned about the economy, home video costs continue to rise, one bright spot has been digital antennas. In third quarter the household penetration of digital antennas reached an all-time high, as consumers seek a less expensive alternative to home entertainment.

Cord Cutting: The rate of consumers dropping their cable/satellite subscription, a trend begun more than a decade ago, has been escalating. With consumers expressing concerns about the cost-of-living and spending, they continue cancel their pay TV subscription. A recent study from U.S. News and World Report, sourcing a variety of public information, says the average monthly cable package is $217.42 more than what the average home pays for all other major utilities combined ($205.50).

The numbers dropping their pay TV subscribers are stark. In MoffettNathanson‚Äôs latest ‚ÄúCord-Cutting Monitor‚Äù points out, this third quarter, 655, 000 subscribers cancelled their cable subscription. A figure higher than the third quarter 2021 falloff of 617,000 and second quarter 2020 of 91,000. (Pay TV subscription includes cable, satellite operators and virtual MVPDs such as YouTube TV and FuboTV). Leichtman Research had similar findings reporting a loss of 785,000 net pay TV subscribers in third quarter 2022. Compared to a loss of 650,000 in third quarter 2021.

The household penetration of pay TV subscribers is now at 61% its lowest in nearly thirty years. By comparison, in 2011 nine in ten households were pay TV subscribers. Ad agency GroupM forecasts ‚Äútraditional pay TV‚Äù will have a U.S. household penetration of 50% in three years.

Subscribers that cancel pay TV subscriptions present financial challenges to cable owners. According to the 2021 THEME Report from the MPA, the cable TV subscription market totaled $96.7 billion in 2021, a 3% decline from 2020. Also, in a first, the revenue of online video surpassed satellite TV. In addition, with a cutback in original programming, the ratings for many top tier cable entertainment networks continue to decline impacting ad dollars.

Streaming Video: Another reason consumers have cut the cord is the same content on cable is also available on streaming video. Nonetheless, streaming video is having growing pains with production costs in the tens of billions and a new round of monthly rate increases, resulting in the launch of ad supported tiers on Netflix and Disney+ and more expected.

In analyzing quarterly earnings reports, Bloomberg found in the first nine months of this year, Disney, Paramount, Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery have reported a greater revenue loss compared to both 2020 and 2021. So far this year, Disney‚Äôs streaming has recorded a net revenue loss of $3.4 billion. Netflix is the only prominent streaming service projected to make a profit this year. (Amazon and Apple do not break out streaming revenue in their corporate earnings report.)

While production costs in the billions continue to impact the bottom line. Another reason is churn. According to research company Antenna, in third quarter of 2022, the rate of streaming video subscriptions being cancelled grew to 6%, nearly double the rate from 2019. In third quarter, there were 32 million cancellations among the ten largest SVOD providers with 37.2 million new sign-ups. Hence, for the quarter there were only 5.2 million net new subscribers less than half the 11.4 million net new subscribers from one year prior.

Nonetheless this is an improvement compared to second quarter when there were only 3.1 million net new SVOD subscribers, when 28.0 million subscriptions were dropped. Antenna reported the second quarter subscriber growth of 1.5% was the lowest since they began measuring it in 2019.

The churn for individual streaming providers varies; but overall, the percentage of churn rates has been on the upswing with more competition. Perhaps, a merger of SVOD services, similar to HBO Max and Discovery+, would help to bring about a slow down to the churn rate.

Digital TV Antennas: As the number of cable subscriptions continues its freefall and streaming video works on a viable revenue model, one area of growth has been the number of households with digital antennas. In the most recent ‚ÄúState of OTA‚Äù report, Horowitz Research, found 18% of households have digital antenna, up from 14% in 2021. (Nielsen reports in fourth quarter 2021 that 15% of households used antennas or 18.6 million homes). In its report Horowitz noted that at 23%, the more cost conscious younger viewers, were more likely to have a digital antenna than persons age 50+ at 15%.

A one-time cost of a single digital TV antenna is affordable. The price range can be as low as $10 or up to over $150. Owners can receive, for free, all local over-the-air broadcast channels (the typical range of a digital antenna is 60 to 75 miles) as well as multicast TV stations (or subchannels) such as Me TV, Cozi and dozens of others. Linear, over-the-air television has been around for 75 years and continues to be the most affordable viewing source available especially during economic slowdowns.",As Cord Cutting Grows And Streaming Video Struggles; Viewers Are Buying Digital Antennas,non-causal,"MPA, TV, OTA, HBO, SVOD",[],[],"['SVOD', 'HBO', 'OTA', 'MPA', 'TV']","['SVOD', 'HBO', 'OTA', 'MPA', 'CAG', 'TV']",0.99398786

Let me explain.

Executives at Alphabet on May 10 will host the annual Google I/O developers conference. This is an important opportunity to reset the narrative about artificial intelligence projects at Google.

Contrary to popular belief, Google has not fallen behind Microsoft (MSFT) in the race for artificial intelligence supremacy. While Microsoft has made some impressive AI strides thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, Google still has a formidable edge in several key areas of AI research and development.

One of these areas is natural language processing, the ability of machines to understand and generate human language. Google has been a pioneer in NLP since its inception, with products like Google Search, Google Translate, and Google Assistant. These cutting-edge applications rely on sophisticated NLP algorithms. And Google‚Äôs state-of-the-art NLP models BERT, T5, and Meena have set new benchmarks for question answering, text summarization, and conversational agents.

Google also excels in computer vision, an AI field devoted to teaching machines to recognize and analyze images. The development of CV at Google began in 2006 with the acquisition of YouTube. The video sharing service gave Google engineers access to a massive amount of image data. Engineers soon leveraged CV expertise to create innovative products such as Google Photos, Google Lens, and Waymo, a subsidiary that uses advanced object detection for self-driving cars.

Artificial neural networks may not be a phrase that rolls easily off the tongue like ChatGPT, yet this technology is foundational to most AI applications. Google has been a leader in ANNs since its launch of Google Brain in 2011, one of the first large-scale projects to use deep learning.

The AI problem at Google is not about engineering. It‚Äôs about marketing.

ChatGPT seems so important because a human-like chatbot seems impossible given the perceived state of technology. Computers are not supposed to be ‚Äúthink‚Äù, let alone carry on reasoned conversation.

At Google I/O executives must reset the conversation about AI and Google.

Admittedly, this is not where top brass at Google shine brightest. Sundar Pichai, chief executive is an engineer‚Äôs engineer. He quietly gets the work done. Pichai came to Google in 2004 after working as a materials engineer at Applied Materials (AMAT), and a stint as a management consultant at McKinsey and Company. He later oversaw the development of Google Chrome, Chrome OS, Gmail and Google Maps. Pichai is affable yet staid, and his management style reflects this temperament. The current conversation about AI demands more. Investors believe Google is facing an existential threat from ChatGPT. Pichai must change that narrative. He needs to turn up the AI wow factor.

Google Assistant is a personalized, AI virtual assistant launched in 2016 at Google I/O. Assistant lives in every Google smart home product, Android-based mobile device, Android Automotive-equipped car and truck, and even on iPhones via popular Google applications like Chrome, Search and Maps. This is billions of devices. Assistant is the perfect vehicle for Pichai to show off what Google AI engineers can do.

At Google I/O on May 10 Pichai is expected to reveal the latest incarnation of Bard, Google‚Äôs answer to ChatGPT. Bard is the natural evolution of Assistant because the AI software is ubiquitous, and already capable of fully duplexed conversation.

More importantly, expectations for Bard are low. Pichai rushed a Bard demo in February to get ahead of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing/ChatGTP reveal. It did not go well. The presentation was riddled with errors and glitchy playback. Shares plunged and the narrative about Microsoft‚Äôs AI lead was born.

At a share price of $107.34, Alphabet trades at 17.3x forward earnings and 4.8x sales. The company has gross profit margins of 55.5% and profit margins of 20.6%. Shares could rally to $122.40 heading into May 10, a gain of 14% from current levels.

By the numbers: 2022 saw a record number of new activist investors, and a record share of activists' activity targeted large companies ‚Äî including Alphabet, Meta and Salesforce.

Driving the news: Last week, Trian Partners claimed victory over Disney in a proxy fight that showed what lies ahead in 2023.
‚Ä¢ Irenic Capital's attack on News Corp last fall captured two key activist trends in a single campaign: Irenic was a first-time activist, and it targeted a large, blue-chip industry name.

Details: Easing volatility and low valuations are keeping activists on center stage. And a drop in M&A volume is among the drivers for big-ticket activist campaigns.
‚Ä¢ 2022 saw a record number of new activist investors, with 55 first-timers representing 36% of all funds waging campaigns, according to Lazard. The prior record was 48 newcomers for 30% of campaigns in 2018.
‚Ä¢ The Lazard data also showed that large cap companies accounted for a record share of activist targets (18%) in 2022.

What they're saying: ""The activists‚Äô play with large caps is, increasingly, break it up, divest, spin it off,"" said Evercore Managing Director Zach Oleksiuk. ""Activists are pushing for M&A opportunities where a buyer isn‚Äôt needed.""
‚Ä¢ Whipsawing markets and tight financing prompted the M&A slowdown, and that meant CEOs were stuck if they wanted to sell or buy a division, or put the whole company on the block.
‚Ä¢ ""Volatility and valuations have come down, and that's created opportunities"" for activists, Oleksiuk said.

What we're watching: The seemingly ideal conditions for dissident shareholders are not lost on the dozens of funds that launched campaigns for the first time last year.
‚Ä¢ These include Mithril Capital's March campaign vs. Adagio Therapeutics, Mill Road's April campaign vs. Big Lots, and Pacific Point's January campaign vs. CH Robinson.
‚Ä¢ Lazard data show that the number of new, overall campaigns last year (235) rose 36% from 2021, nearly reaching 2018's record of 249.

""What had always held back the expansion of activism was boards who supported management teams come hell or high water. That's changing,"" says Jim Rossman, Barclays' global head of shareholder advisory.

The big picture: Another factor fueling activism is the growing support of other shareholders. The negative stigma that used to dog activists is fading, Rossman notes.
‚Ä¢ In addition, most companies today have a small amount of institutional investors holding a significant amount of stock.

It‚Äôs a label the company lost a long time ago after a series of small startups grew to become Microsoft‚Äôs biggest competitors. Google, for example, started out as a nimble, innovative upstart and eventually bested Microsoft in browsers, email, and mobile operating systems. But now Microsoft might be the nimble, innovative company that bests Google in artificial intelligence. And it‚Äôs all thanks to OpenAI.

OpenAI is the hottest AI lab out there with one of the buzziest and most exciting products: ChatGPT. And Microsoft is its very good friend. On Monday, the two companies announced that Microsoft was investing $10 billion into OpenAI (that‚Äôs on top of the $3 billion Microsoft has given OpenAI since 2019), and Microsoft is rumored to be adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine. Yeah, that‚Äôs right: The much-maligned, little-used Bing might finally become a real competitor to Google‚Äôs search.

Following the news of Microsoft‚Äôs $10 billion investment, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that ChatGPT is a ‚Äúpotential game changer‚Äù for Microsoft, and that the company was ‚Äúnot going to repeat the same mistakes‚Äù of missing out on social and mobile that it made two decades ago. Microsoft ‚Äúis clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind,‚Äù Ives wrote.

There are parallels here, at least on the surface. Microsoft was once the dominant player in computer technology, with its Windows operating system being used by the vast majority of personal computers and its Internet Explorer browser being used by the vast majority of web surfers. And then it got in trouble with the US government, which sued Microsoft for using its dominant position to unfairly drive out competition and take over the then-nascent browser market by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. The lawsuit tied up Microsoft for years. In that environment, companies like Google emerged, putting out better products that people preferred in an exponentially growing market.

Microsoft still did just fine ‚Äî it remains one of the most valuable companies in the world and is still more valuable than Google ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt have the same consumer-facing cachet it did before. Its enterprise clients drive the vast majority of its revenue, through products like Microsoft 365 and Azure. Google, by contrast, is very visible to and much-used by the general consumer, owning everything from Chrome to Gmail to YouTube. Its main revenue source is the digital ads that consumers see as they navigate the internet, and the majority of them are using Google services while they do it.

But now Google is the company that‚Äôs having antitrust issues, facing multiple lawsuits from the federal government and almost every state and territory in the country that target core parts of its business, including one that was filed just yesterday. Those may well clear the way for Microsoft to be the leader in a burgeoning industry with a ton of potential: AI. Companies like OpenAI have made significant advancements in the technology and are now showing it off to the general public, while Google‚Äôs competing products are practically nowhere to be found beyond updates on Google‚Äôs blog. (Microsoft isn‚Äôt entirely in the clear, as the Federal Trade Commission is currently trying to block its massive merger with the gaming company Activision Blizzard, but it‚Äôs in a much better position, antitrust-wise.)

That‚Äôs not to say that Google doesn‚Äôt recognize AI‚Äôs potential and increasing importance. It‚Äôs been working on AI offerings for years, and has some of the best ones. It acquired the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, before OpenAI even existed. And it developed the Transformer technology that ChatGPT is built on (GPT stands for Generative Prediction Transformer).

But Google has held back on giving them the kind of public demonstration that OpenAI has, saying it wants to ensure that its products are responsible and safe before unleashing them. Not helping matters was a claim from a (now-former) engineer that Google‚Äôs chatbot technology, LaMDA, had become sentient. That‚Äôs been widely dismissed (and denied by Google), but it underlined how advanced the technology has become. And it showed the risks not of the technology becoming sentient, but of it being so good that people would think it was and start to treat it as such.

Now that ChatGPT is out there, Google has to play catch-up and figure out how it wants to integrate its AI technology into its own offerings. It‚Äôs even, reportedly, brought back founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help out. The company also recently published a paper outlining its approach to AI and how important it is for that approach to be responsible (or Google‚Äôs definition of responsible, given the lack of government regulations).

‚ÄúGoogle is, I think, justified and correct in taking this seriously and taking Microsoft‚Äôs bid to use this tech to seriously compete with them in advertising, search engines, and other products,‚Äù said Derek Leben, a professor at Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs business school who focuses on AI ethics. ‚ÄúI think this is a very brilliant move from [Microsoft CEO] Satya Nadella. This is something that is definitely going to position Microsoft very well.‚Äù

But, Leben warned, there remains the question of whether the benefits of these products outweigh their risks ‚Äî and if rushing them to market to compete will enhance those risks.

‚ÄúThat is indeed the problem with arms races,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey tend to motivate actors in them to move faster, and accept risks that they otherwise would not have accepted.‚Äù

Maybe OpenAI‚Äôs technology is a game changer. Maybe it‚Äôs just a party trick. Either way, Microsoft‚Äôs got it, and a lot of people think it‚Äôs amazing. That perception is important. Google now finds itself in a similar position that it helped put Microsoft in two decades ago: hoping it can release something better before it gets passed by.

‚ÄúSo many people want to say Thrasio is a rocket ship. But they go really fast, then stop and just hang out in space. There‚Äôs no winning,‚Äù Greeley, 59, told Forbes in his first interview since joining the company in August. ‚ÄúSome rocket ships blow up, which is even worse.‚Äù

Thrasio didn‚Äôt blow up, but it did come back to earth earlier this year. After a period of soaring growth, the company hit a rough patch after pandemic lockdowns loosened up. Thrasio buys online brands that sell on the Amazon marketplace and uses its expertise to goose sales and profits by upgrading marketing, supply chain and other operations. With e-commerce slowing, the company conducted a round of layoffs and endured a period of turnover among its executive ranks, with both cofounders departing and its chief financial officer leaving after just three months. It even paused acquisitions for the first half of the year, according to Greeley.

Greeley said Thrasio is once again doing what it‚Äôs meant to do ‚Äî actively evaluating new deals. He said a number of conversations with sellers are in progress.

He did acknowledge the company made mistakes, which he said stemmed largely from an assumption that demand for online goods would remain at heightened, pandemic-era levels. Thrasio has since had to ‚Äúrecalibrate expectations,‚Äù he said, and make sure it‚Äôs not hiring too many people, holding too much inventory or offering multiples for new acquisitions that are too high.

However, he said the steps the company is taking to get back on track are nothing more than service changes on a race car, like changing the tires or refilling the gas tank. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really just course corrections,‚Äù Greeley said. ‚ÄúOur north star remains the same.‚Äù

Instead of a rocket, Greeley said he‚Äôd rather describe Thrasio as a race car that can go ‚Äúsuper fast,‚Äù a nod to the company‚Äôs turbocharged early growth that quickly made it the largest acquirer of Amazon brands. Since 2018, it has raised $3.4 billion in funding from blue-chip investors like Silver Lake, Advent International and Oaktree, which it used to acquire over 200 brands and hire hundreds of employees. Its founders sought to fashion it into a type of Procter & Gamble for the digital age, accumulating online brands that sell everything from cleaning products to pillows to bike pumps.

Thrasio‚Äôs success prompted a wave of copycats, with dozens of other Amazon aggregators like Perch, Heyday and Acquco springing up and raising billions from investors during the pandemic. But funding in the space dried up this year and there have been few new entrants. Many existing companies have struggled to manage a growing portfolio of brands at a time of supply chain challenges, inflation and the slowdown in e-commerce spending.

‚ÄúThe craze has basically evaporated,‚Äù said Juozas Kaziukƒónas, founder of e-commerce data firm Marketplace Pulse. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs up to them [aggregators] to figure out how to do the thing they promised to do. It‚Äôs a proving ground.‚Äù

reeley spent the better part of his career at Amazon, joining in 1999 when it was a small online bookseller. A few years into his tenure, he was part of a discussion with founder Jeff Bezos that led the company to try a membership program with unlimited two-day shipping. They called it Amazon Prime. Greeley then led parts of Amazon‚Äôs international business, managing affairs in Europe and launching the site in India, Australia and Brazil.

He took over Amazon Prime in 2013, adding dozens of additional features, like same-day delivery, music and audiobooks. Under his watch, the Prime program grew tenfold to over 100 million members.

In 2018, Greeley left to join Airbnb as a vice president, helping to expand the number and types of homes on the platform. He then spent a brief stint at a startup called Opentrons Labworks, which created inexpensive Covid-19 tests.

He joined Thrasio earlier this year after being struck by the size of the Amazon seller community, which numbers over two million. Thrasio has helped many of those sellers cash out by buying their businesses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to be a destination for them,‚Äù said Greeley, who is based in Seattle. ‚ÄúTo help them take their dream and the products they invented, bring them into our platform and help continue to drive improvements and make them more successful.‚Äù

The company recently estimated that one in three American households have purchased something from a Thrasio brand, up from a prior estimate of one in six. When Greeley was considering taking the job, he realized he already owned several Thrasio products, including a Hi-Coup wine decanter and a Mixology & Craft bartending set that he uses to make Aviation cocktails. He has since replaced all the pillows in his house with ones from Beckham Hotel Collection, and a glow-in-the-dark football from GlowCity has become a hit with his family.

It‚Äôs still unclear whether Thrasio and others have been able to grow sales and profits across the companies they‚Äôve acquired by operating them at scale. Greeley declined to disclose financials, saying that the company has more brands that have topped expectations than have underperformed. He declined to share what percentage of sellers have received the portion of their payout tied to performance.

Greeley said that Thrasio will remain in acquisition mode and continue to buy more companies of all stripes, adding to its portfolio in a wide range of categories.

Another key priority will be to continue to diversify away from Amazon, which has seen a slowdown in online sales this year. It wants customers to have the option of purchasing products in stores and on other retailers‚Äô websites. It already has some products at Target and Walmart. Its B-Six nipple covers are sold in Nordstrom, Bloomingdale‚Äôs, Urban Outfitters and Revolve. In May, its pet deodorizer brand Angry Orange launched nationwide at PetSmart stores.

‚ÄúA big part of our focus is getting the right products where customers want to find them,‚Äù Greeley said.","In His First Interview, Thrasio's New CEO Puts Company Turmoil In The Rear-View Mirror",non-causal,CEO,"['SLB', 'P', 'S']",['SLB'],['CEO'],"['SLB', 'P', 'S', 'CEO']",-0.9991587

The agency accuses the company of abusing ‚Äúmonopoly power‚Äù at the disadvantage of websites and advertisers who use other advertising tools, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday (PDF). A press conference is scheduled for 2PM ET to announce the lawsuit.

‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google‚Äôs few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,‚Äù the lawsuit reads.

It goes on to allege that Google‚Äôs various acquisitions allowed it to ‚Äúneutralize or eliminate‚Äù competitors. According to the government‚Äôs lawyers, when you add up the alleged anti-competitive moves, ‚Äúthese interrelated and interdependent actions have had a cumulative and synergistic effect that has harmed competition and the competitive process.‚Äù

Google knew this was coming. Last year, the company attempted to avoid a potential lawsuit from the DOJ by offering to separate its ad auctions business, which sells and puts ads on customers‚Äô websites, from Google‚Äôs digital advertising arm. But instead of making it a separate company altogether, the move would‚Äôve put the division under the umbrella of Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet.

That and the other concessions Google reportedly offered obviously weren‚Äôt enough to convince the DOJ that it‚Äôs not engaging in anti-competitive practices. The DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit asks the court to force Google to divest its advertising businesses. Eight states, including New York, California, Connecticut, and Virginia, also signed on to the suit. Google didn‚Äôt immediately respond to The Verge‚Äôs request for comment.

The DOJ sued Google for similar reasons in 2020, accusing it of illegal monopolization of the search and ad markets. At the time, the agency asked the court to ‚Äúbreak Google‚Äôs grip on search distribution so that competition and innovation can take hold.‚Äù Earlier this month, Google filed a motion to dismiss a complaint from the agency that alleges Google leverages its Android operating system and general grasp on the search market to further limit competition in the industry.

The DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit comes as part of a wider governmental crackdown on the grasp of Big Tech. In May of last year, a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats introduced the Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act. The bill could force companies and Google and Meta to divest their advertising businesses, as it would bar companies processing over $20 billion per year in digital ad transactions from partaking in multiple parts of the digital ad industry.",Google is being sued by the US government and eight states over online advertising,non-causal,"ET, PDF, US, DOJ",['COVID'],[],"['DOJ', 'ET', 'PDF', 'US']","['PDF', 'DOJ', 'ET', 'COVID', 'HUM', 'US']",0.95202965

On Tuesday, Twitter CEO Elon Musk closed the loop on this decade-spanning aphorism as he delivered his latest business pitch. ""There are about 120 to 130 million hours of human attention per day on Twitter,"" Musk told the audience at a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco.

The only problem, Musk went on to explain, is that Twitter isn't getting a good return on this massive hoard of human attention. The company currently only generates ""about 5 or 6 cents per hour,"" Musk said. It's worth much more than that, Musk said.

""We can probably at least get it to like 15 cents an hour, 20 cents an hour,"" he said ‚Äî perhaps even 25 cents an hour, he added.

The new performance metric, if that's what it can be called, is classic Musk. The business model is no different than that of other consumer internet companies like Facebook, Snapchat, or Google, which sell advertising space to marketers seeking to reach their users. But Musk, who acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October, is looking for fresh new ways to stand out from the pack, even as his chaotic stewardship of the company leaves many observers dumbfounded.

Moments before taking the stage at the conference on Tuesday, Musk publicly feuded with a laid off Twitter employee, dismissing the employee's contributions and mocking the person's disability (Musk later apologized for the comments and said the employee, who has muscular dystrophy, may remain at Twitter after all).

Musk's appearance at a Wall Street investment bank conference was unusual in itself, given that Twitter is now a privately-held company. The roughly hour-long on-stage interview with Morgan Stanley star tech banker Michael Grimes represented some of Musk's most extensive public comments about his vision for Twitter and the state of its business since he took over.

Twitter could break-even on cash flow basis in the second quarter of the year, and even has a ""shot"" at being cash flow positive, Musk said. The social media app currently has 250 million daily active users and 500 million ""active"" users, he said, without specifying the criteria for the latter category.

But Musk, who is also the CEO of electric car maker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, did not discuss (nor was he asked by Grimes), some of the company's controversial financial practices such as media reports that Twitter is not paying rent for some offices and has refused to pay vendors for private jet flights that company executives took before his acquisition.

Twitter's service has suffered several outages since Musk took over, something he has ascribed to the site's ""brittle"" technical infrastructure erected by his predecessors but which critics say are the result of deep and haphazard layoffs that have eliminated roughly 75% of the staff. And Musk's loosening of content moderation rules, as well as re-instating banned users including former President Donald Trump, have led to an uptick in certain types of misinformation according to some studies.

Musk says Twitter is the ""best source of truth""

Musk described Twitter on Tuesday as the ""number one news app,"" and said his goal is to make it the ""best source of truth."" On top of that, he reiterated his plans to make Twitter an ‚Äúeverything app"" with a ‚Äúvery powerful finance experience‚Äù that is better than PayPal, a financial company he founded and was subsequently ousted from at the beginning of his entrepreneurial career.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs possible to become the biggest financial institution in the world, just by providing people with convenient payment options,"" Musk said of Twitter.

Musk and prior Twitter management have had a notoriously hard time turning a profit. It was profitable in 2018 and 2019, but not in any other years since its inception. Musk's first tangible attempt at monetizing users to turn a profit was revamping the firm's $8 subscription service Twitter Blue, which only netted 180,000 U.S subscribers two months after its launch.

Musk claimed during the interview that the firm is profitable based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda), he underlines that the ""D"" component is rather large and that they should concentrate on the ""E"" part. Again, he didn't delve into financial specifics, which he isn't bound to do since he took the company private.

While Musk has explored various revenue streams, including the $8 per month Twitter Blue subscription service, advertising appears to be the main lever with which Musk is thinking about to achieve the company's ""gigantic"" revenue potential.

Twitter will stop serving ads that are ""annoying, strident, or ugly,"" he said, and is making it easier for marketers to bid on the best keywords to reach users.

The new Twitter will be a ""win win situation,"" he said, as advertisers tap into Twitter's audience and pay the company more money for the privilege.

""Your time is incredibly valuable,"" Musk said.

The top and bottom lines advanced year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results have been bolstered by robust global demand, continued strength in the Nutrition unit and a solid product portfolio.



Shares of ADM have lost 8.8% in the past three months compared with the industry‚Äôs 9.4% decline.

Archer Daniels‚Äô adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share in the fourth quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64. The figure also jumped 28.7% from $1.50 in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels‚Äô earnings were $1.84 per share, up 33.3% from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs $1.26.

Revenues advanced 13.6% year over year to $26,231 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,224 million. Solid sales across all segments contributed to the top line.



Segment-wise, revenues for Ag Services & Oilseeds grew 16.3% year over year, whereas Carbohydrate Solutions‚Äô revenues rose 1.9% year over year. Nutrition witnessed year-over-year revenue growth of 7.3%.



The gross profit increased 6.8% year over year to $1,762 million, while the gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 6.7% in the quarter under review. SG&A expenses rose 14.1% to $897 million.



Archer Daniels has reported an adjusted segmental operating profit of $1,665 million in fourth-quarter 2022, up 17.8% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, ADM‚Äôs segmental operating profits grew 16.1% year over year to $1,611 million.

Adjusted operating profit for Ag Services & Oilseeds rose 46.2% year over year to $1,184 million. This can be attributable to strength across the South American region, driven by higher margins and volumes, while low water conditions reduced North America export volumes. The Global Trade performance was drab due to lower ocean freight, partly offset by robust results in EMEA origination and destination marketing.



Crushing results have been sharply higher year over year. Strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins in North America. Solid oil demand in EMEA led to strong rapeseed margins, which more than offset higher energy costs.



Refined Products and Other results have been strong year over year, benefiting from healthy demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the United States and biodiesel globally. Also, equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher than that in the year-earlier quarter.



The Carbohydrate Solutions segment‚Äôs adjusted operating profit declined 39% to $261 million. The Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, has recorded improved year-over-year results. This was mainly owing to solid volumes and strong margins in the North America region, which partly offset lower ethanol margins. Meanwhile, robust margins aided the EMEA region. The global wheat milling business witnessed higher margins, driven by solid demand.



Vantage Corn Processors‚Äô results have been soft due to higher ethanol inventory levels, which, in turn, dented the margins.



In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $131 million fell 18.1% from $160 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit remained dismal year over year. The Flavors unit remained flat, while the continued momentum aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health & Wellness business witnessed year-over-year growth, driven by the bioactives portfolio, including the results of the Deerland acquisition.



The Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids due to a recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results have acted as an upside, driven by APAC and Latin America, partly offset by the impacts of sluggish demand in EMEA.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,037 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,677 million; and shareholders‚Äô equity of $24,317 million. In the nine months ending Dec 31, 2022, ADM used $3,478 million in cash for operating activities.



The board raised its quarterly dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents, payable on Mar 2, 2023, to shareholders as of record as of Feb 9. This marks the 365th consecutive quarterly payment and 50th dividend hike.

Here are some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely e.l.f. Beauty ELF, Conagra Brands CAG and Campbell Soup CPB.

The reduction in roles is probably higher given many tech companies have not been replacing staff members who have resigned.

Atlassian‚Äôs cuts come just months after a recruitment drive, showing the volatility of a sector that tends to record extraordinary growth and sharp pullbacks, depending on economic conditions.

Many tech companies recorded strong growth throughout the three pandemic years, as consumers bought gadgets, binge-watched streaming services and had web meetings with colleagues.

‚ÄúThe tech sector got an incredible boost and they went on a hiring spree,‚Äù said Dr Nathalie Collins, a senior lecturer at Edith Cowan University‚Äôs business and law school.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a normalisation and a market correction and they are going back to delivering on their core businesses.‚Äù

Atlassian‚Äôs business is tightly linked to the broader health of the economy given the business-focused nature of its software.

The changes, described in the memo as a ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù, largely affect talent acquisition, program management and research roles, the company said.

While many technical staff have been affected by recent sector cuts, non-tech roles like human resources divisions have also been targeted.

Atlassian said the cuts were not a reflection of its financial performance and it said it would reinvest in priority areas.

The company‚Äôs share price is down more than 60% from its record high in 2021. Shortly before that, it announced plans to construct the world‚Äôs tallest hybrid timber tower, located next to Sydney‚Äôs Central Station, which is now under construction.

It passed by a vote of 242-184. The passage of the bill, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, marks a significant step in a deeply divided Congress. A version of the bill already passed the Senate and the House package gained the support of the White House in a statement this week. The bill would increase the fees businesses pay to federal agencies when a large merger deal requires government review, which would raise money for the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Antitrust Division. But for smaller deals that still require review, it would lower the fees. The antitrust agencies have complained of being severely under-resourced for years, even as many lawmakers have increasingly expected them to bring more cases enforcing antitrust statutes and the rate of dealmaking has soared. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated the measure would save the federal government $1.4 billion over the next five years. The package passed by the House also included what were once two separate bills. The first, the Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act, would require merging companies to disclose to federal agencies subsidies by foreign adversaries, like Chinese and Russian entities. The second, the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, would give state attorneys general more control over which court will hear their antitrust cases. That legislation, a version of which passed the Senate, would solve the sort of issue attorneys general faced in their antitrust lawsuit against Google in Texas, which the company was able to move to New York. Attorneys general around the country largely support the measure so companies can't move lawsuits to what they feel will be more favorable jurisdictions.

Despite the largely simple and bipartisan nature of the legislation, they still sparked infighting among GOP representatives shortly before the votes. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, questioned why Congress should give an agency like the Federal Trade Commission a way to make more money when he believes it is run by a ""woke radical"" in Democratic Chair Lina Khan. Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., the ranking member on the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee who has championed the antitrust reforms, pushed back on Jordan's critiques. After the House Judiciary Committee's GOP page tweeted that ""Democrats want to set aside more money for the Biden FTC and DOJ to target conservatives,"" Buck tweeted back that last he checked, he and several other Republicans who have supported the measures are not Democrats. Meanwhile, a handful of California Democrats critiqued the state venue act as well, even as their state attorney general supported it. The divides underscore just how big a hurdle lawmakers face in trying to pass an even more sweeping bill in the American Innovation and Choice Online Act. Also referred to as the self-preferencing or anti-discrimination bill, the legislation would prevent large tech platforms like Amazon, Apple and Google from favoring their own products over others that rely on their marketplaces. That could mean Google couldn't unfairly show its own local search results over a rivals' like Yelp's. And Amazon couldn't simply choose to rank its first-party products over competitors. That bill seemed to have momentum at the beginning of the summer, but optimism about its passage slowly deflated as it became clear Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would not schedule a vote before the August recess. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who's led the legislation in the Senate, said she hasn't lost hope. But time is running out and the fierce debate over the much less complicated legislation passed by the House on Thursday shows there will still be steep hurdles to overcome.

The industrial average is up 2.3% on a weekly basis at the time of this deadline. The last time the index had a winning streak this long was 2017.

The tech sector is not telling the same success story, and the Nasdaq Composite felt the blow of disappointing results from companies like Netflix and Tesla. The index was down 0.5% on a weekly basis at press time.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk lost almost $20 billion on Thursday as investors rushed to dump the carmaker‚Äôs stock. Shares were down almost 10% on Thursday and are closing the week on a negative note. The company lost over $90 billion in value despite presenting successful quarterly results that surpassed analyst expectations and featured an all-time high quarterly revenue figure.

Analysts blamed Musk‚Äôs poorly chosen focus points during the conference call. The CEO spoke about possible price cuts for Tesla vehicles and failed to provide specific details over key future developments, such as a launch date for the company‚Äôs long-awaited Cybertruck. Musk also mentioned likely cuts in production output due to summer factory shutdowns.

Netflix posted better-than-expected earnings per share but missed estimates on revenue. Analysts praised the company‚Äôs recent crackdown on account sharing, which resulted in almost 6 million new accounts being opened on the platform after more than 100 million people were found to be sharing their password with persons outside their household. Netflix shares had lost almost 4% on the week at the time of deadline. In spite of the sell-off, most analysts raised their price targets for the streaming stock.

Retail sales across the U.S. continued to grow in June, yet at a slower pace than before. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed that retail sales were up 0.2% over May, showing healthy spending power across the country.

Good quarterly results from major banks helped maintain a positive sentiment across the market as the sector shows resilience in a volatile macroeconomic environment. Bank of America shares are up 8.2% weekly as the company‚Äôs results beat consensus estimates from analysts. Revenues climbed to $25.2 billion this quarter.

Morgan Stanley shares are up 9.6% on the week after also beating estimates. Charles Schwab was the winner of the gang, with stock climbing 15.2% on a weekly basis at the time of this deadline. The bank had its best trading session in three years on Tuesday, climbing 12% in one day.

Apple shares rose on Wednesday after it became known the company is working on its own AI engine that could compete with OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard.

ExxonMobil surprised investors by announcing plans to begin mining for lithium, a key component in electric car batteries, in Arkansas. The event marks a clear strategy of diversification into the EV industry for the oil giant.

Climate instability continues to take its toll on corporate America. This week, a production plant for pharma giant Pfizer, Inc. suffered heavy damage from a tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

A hurdle was removed this week in the high-stakes $69 billion merger of Microsoft with gaming giant Activision Blizzard after the Federal Trade Commission agreed to pause an antitrust lawsuit that was blocking what could become the largest-ever deal in the gaming industry.

The Justice Department and six states are suing American and JetBlue in federal court over their regional partnership in the Northeast, which government lawyers call a de facto merger. Isom defended the arrangement, which has been in effect for well over a year, as JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes did last week during a trial in federal court in Boston.

The Justice Department is trying to convince U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin to kill the partnership, under which American and JetBlue work together to set schedules and share revenue, although they are not allowed to collaborate on prices.

American and JetBlue say the government has no evidence that the deal is hurting consumers. To the contrary, they say it will help travelers by creating a stronger competitor to Delta and United in New York and Boston.

Musk explained that he cofounded OpenAI in reaction to Google cofounder Larry Page‚Äôs lack of concern over the danger of AI outsmarting humans.

He said the two were once close friends and that he would often stay at Page‚Äôs house in Palo Alto where they would talk late into the night about the technology. Page was such a fan of Musk‚Äôs that in Jan. 2015, Google invested $1 billion in SpaceX for a 10% stake with Fidelity Investments. ‚ÄúHe wants to go to Mars. That‚Äôs a worthy goal,‚Äù Page said in a March 2014 TED Talk .

But Musk was concerned over Google‚Äôs acquisition of DeepMind in Jan. 2014.

‚ÄúAt the time Google had acquired DeepMind, and so Google and DeepMind together had about three-quarters of all the AI talent in the world. They obviously had a tremendous amount of money and more computers than anyone else. So I‚Äôm like we‚Äôre in a unipolar world where there‚Äôs just one company that has close to a monopoly on AI talent and computers,‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúAnd the person in charge doesn‚Äôt seem to care about safety. This is not good.‚Äù

Musk said he felt Page was seeking to build a digital super intelligence, a digital god.

‚ÄúHe's made many public statements over the years that the whole goal of Google is what's called AGI artificial general intelligence or artificial super intelligence,‚Äù Musk said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has not disagreed. In his 60 minutes interview on Sunday, while speaking about the company‚Äôs advancements in AI, Pichai said that Google Search was only one to two percent of the way Google can help users, but that he welcomes regulation of the technology.

Musk said Page stopped talking to him when he launched OpenAI in Dec. 2015 with Y Combinator CEO Sam Altman and PayPal alums LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman and Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, among others.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt spoken to Larry Page in a few years because he got very upset with me over OpenAI,‚Äù said Musk explaining that when OpenAI was created it shifted things from a unipolar world where Google DeepMind controlled three-quarters of the world‚Äôs AI talent to a bipolar world. ‚ÄúAnd now it seems that OpenAI is ahead,‚Äù he said.

But even before OpenAI, as SpaceX was announcing the Google investment in late Jan. 2015, Musk had given $10 million to the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing existential risks from advanced artificial intelligence, founded in March 2014 by AI scientists from DeepMind, MIT, Tufts, UCSC and others. The same organization that issued a petition calling for a pause in AI development that Musk signed last month.

In 2018, citing potential conflicts with his work with Tesla, Musk resigned his seat on the board of OpenAI.

‚ÄúI put a lot of effort into creating this organization to serve as a counterweight to Google and then I kind of took my eye off the ball and now they are closed source, and obviously for profit, and they‚Äôre closely allied with Microsoft. In effect, Microsoft has a very strong say, if not directly controls OpenAI at this point,‚Äù Musk said.

Ironically, Hoffman, who is Musk‚Äôs former PayPal chum and became an independent director at Microsoft in 2017, sold LinkedIn to Microsoft for more than $26 billion in 2019, is likely how the San Francisco startup got Microsoft‚Äôs backing. The company invested its first billion dollars into OpenAI in 2019 and has since invested billions, as much as $10 billion this past January. An OpenAI cofounder, Hoffman only recently stepped down from OpenAI‚Äôs board on March 3 to clear the way to start investing in the OpenAI startup ecosystem. Hoffman is a partner in the venture capital firm Greylock and an prolific angel investor.

All sit at the top of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. As of April 17 5pm ET, Musk was the world‚Äôs second richest person valued at $187.4 billion, Page the eleventh at $90.1 billion. Google cofounder Sergey Brin is in the 12 spot at $86.3 billion. Hoffman ranks 1570 with a net worth of $2 billion.

Musk said he thinks Page believes all consciousness should be treated equally while he disagrees, especially if the digital consciousness decides to curtail the biological intelligence. Like Pichai, Musk is advocating for government regulation over the technology and says at minimum there should be an off switch to cut power and connectivity to server farms in case administrative passwords stop working.

Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen that movie.

Musk told Carlson that he‚Äôs considering naming his new AI company TruthGPT.

‚ÄúI will create a third option, although it's starting very late in the game,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCan it be done? I don't know.‚Äù

Why it matters: CVS is among the retail giants in an arms race to add capabilities like primary care or telehealth across the health care continuum. It's vying with Amazon, Walmart, Dollar General and Walgreens, among others.
‚Ä¢ The pharmacy giant already owns Aetna, pharmacy benefit manager CVS-Caremark and health care service brands MinuteClinic and HealthHUB.
‚Ä¢ In January, CVS Health announced a plan to buy Oak Street Health, a primary care group focused on Medicare patients, for $10.5 billion.

What they're saying: ""If you think about what's happening in health care today, people are accessing health care in various ways,"" Lynch told Axios‚Äô Hope King.
‚Ä¢ ""They're accessing it in the home. That's why Signify. We've seen primary care as an underutilized health care service. That's part of why we're extending into primary care with Oak Street. Technology is really the enabler.""

Between the lines: CVS plans to use a ""payer-agnostic"" model, believing patients will access services through both insurers and provider recommendations, Lynch said.
‚Ä¢ Signify Health uses technology to support in-home care and service coordination for employers, physician groups, health systems and health plans. It has about 10,000 providers across all 50 states, Lynch said.
‚Ä¢ ""One of the things they are able to see is what is going on in the home,"" Lynch said. That includes visibility of what kinds of foods patients stock in their refrigerators or whether there are household hazards that could increase the risk of a fall.
‚Ä¢ ""How do we use the assets of CVS Health to make sure that they're taking the right meds? We can do pharmacy reconciliations,"" she said. ""If they need follow-up care, we can recommend they go to a Minute Clinic. We can recommend if they need specialty infusions, we can bring our nurses in. If you think about our asset as a company, we can really improve their access and quality of care.""

Be smart: CVS Health has its work cut out as it integrates Signify and Oak Street Health while tending to its other business segments, some of which are affected by declining COVID business, Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson wrote in a note last month, noting the company has ""lots of wood still to chop.""

What to watch: Both the Signify deal and the Oak Street purchase are part of a focus on serving an aging population.
‚Ä¢ ""If you look around the corner, there's a tsunami of aging Americans. There are more people today between the ages of 50 and 64 than there are in the Medicare population,"" Lynch said.

The same with the sell side of digital advertising. And then they bought the auction house. They bought ad tech, so that they own the entire spectrum of digital advertising.

""They control the flow of information in this country,"" Buck said. ""And when you control the flow of information, you control elections. And that's what's so dangerous.""

According to The Hill, the DOJ this week filed its second lawsuit against Google. The DOJ argues that Google used a ""'simple but effective' strategy to acquire power in the digital ad space."" The complaint alleges the tech giant blocked ad tech rivals via acquisitions and wielded its market dominance to ""force more publishers and advertisers"" to use its products while ""disrupting their ability to use competing products effectively.""

Though we may hear regulatory noise tied to Alphabet this year, it's unlikely there will be material risks to the company's bottom line, according to Martin.

""Our top investment conclusion from our meetings in Washington, D.C. last week is that nothing bad will happen to Google on the legislative, regulatory or litigation fronts during 2023,"" she wrote in the March 8 note. ""Based on our conversations, we perceive that headline risks are bigger than substantive risks.""

However, that doesn't mean there's no chance something could go wrong for Google on the judicial front.

""The most urgent risk for Google is the current U.S. Supreme Court case called 'Gonzalez v. Google,' for which arguments were heard in February 2023,"" Martin wrote. Section 230, a law that allows tech companies to moderate their platforms as they see fit, is at the center of that case. Still, Martin said that D.C. experts are confident Google will win the case, that legislators won't act, and Section 230 will continue to stand.

Google, challenging federal protections for internet and social media companies freeing them of responsibility for content posted by users in a case involving social media giant Google and its subsidiary YouTube, whom they argue bear some responsibility for their daughter‚Äôs death.

""There was a consensus in D.C. that Section 230 legislation, which allows YouTube and Search to moderate content on their platforms however they see fit, will not get reformed (ie, or pass the House and Senate) during 2023, thereby retaining the status quo into next year,"" she wrote.

Meanwhile, Meta, despite its most recent standoff with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is also likely to be relatively safe from regulatory risks this year, Martin determined.

""Because its primary pursuer is the FTC, which is in disarray, Meta will be largely protected from regulatory harms in 2023,"" she wrote, adding that she also expects the Department of Justice to be neutral on Meta after the two parties recently settled a case surrounding how housing advertisements work on the platform.

The FTC last year tried to block Facebook owner Meta's acquisition of VR app Within, a battle the regulator lost. The company finally closed the deal in February, with financial terms undisclosed.

In part, DC may back off because Meta ‚Äì which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp ‚Äì simply isn't as ""big"" of a target as it once was.

""Two separate D.C. experts believed that regulatory scrutiny of Meta had moderated because its share price has fallen,"" Martin wrote. ""Because 'big is bad' in DC, some DC insiders believe Meta should be more regulated at a $1T market cap than today's $475B market cap. (This must be a lawyer's view, because it makes no sense to us.)""

Supporters of efforts to revamp antitrust laws, as well as update kids‚Äô online safety regulations, hoped to add such measures to the omnibus funding bill in a last-ditch effort to pass them this year, but a swath of tech bills were left out, according to text released early Tuesday.

A couple of less controversial antitrust reform bills, including one to update merger filing fees and another to let states choose the venue for antitrust enforcement cases, made it into the text. But on the whole, the multi-year bipartisan effort to reform competition bills to target tech giants appears to have failed as the current Congress winds down.

Supporters had been pushing for two other antitrust bills, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which aims to limit tech companies from preferencing their own products and services, and the Open App Markets Act, which aims to impose additional regulations on dominant app stores. The proposals came out of a House Judiciary Committee investigation into the market power of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, now under the parent company name Meta.

Both of the bills advanced out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with bipartisan support, but appear to be falling by the wayside without coming up for a vote on the floor of either chamber as the 117th Congress comes to a close.

The Open App Markets Act particularly faced a last-minute opposition push from the tech industry. The Chamber of Progress, which names Apple, Google, Meta and Amazon as corporate partners, launched an ad on connected TV earlier this month slamming the bill over accusations that it would ‚Äúforce companies to provide a soapbox to dangerous extremists.‚Äù

Supporters of the antitrust bill said accusations like the one Chamber of Progress pushed were red herrings and not an accurate portrayal of the legislation.

Although the antitrust bills had support on both sides of the aisle, House Republicans set to take control next year have set their sights on prioritizing content moderation concerns. The focus of top House GOP members like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is slated to chair the Judiciary Committee next year, on allegations of anti-conservative ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù will likely push the antitrust bills to the back burner.

In addition to antitrust reform, there was bipartisan support in Congress this year for efforts to improve kids‚Äô online safety laws. Two bills in particular, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) 2.0, gained steam. The bills advanced with bipartisan support out of the Senate Commerce committee.

Parent advocates whose children‚Äôs deaths were tied to social media met with lawmakers throughout the past couple of months in a last-minute push to pass the bills. But they ultimately failed to make it into the omnibus spending bill.

KOSA in particular faced an opposition campaign near the end of the year from a group of human rights and LGBTQ organizations, as well as the Center for Democracy and Technology, who argued that the bill would actually make kids less safe online and disproportionately harm marginalized youth.

But parent advocates who spoke to members of Congress, as well as kids‚Äô safety groups such as Fairplay and ParentsTogether, said the proposal would make the internet safer for kids by adding new requirements for how companies treat young users.

KOSA would create a duty of care for social media platforms to prevent and mitigate harm to minors, and require them to put the strictest privacy settings in place as the default for such users.

COPPA 2.0 would update the 1998 children‚Äôs privacy law to include protections for minors aged 12-16, who are not covered by the existing law. It would also add new protections such as a ban on targeted advertising to minors.

Some less controversial tech bills did make it into the omnibus text, including two of the antitrust proposals spawned by the House investigation. The spending bill includes the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, which would update filing fees to increase them for larger deals, and the Venue for State Antitrust Enforcement, which would allow states to choose where antitrust cases are heard, including cases that are pending by the date of the bill being enacted.

The INFORM Act, which aims to verify the identity of online sellers on virtual marketplaces, is also included in the bill.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. have dropped by more than 9 percent in intraday trading.

YouTube, owned by Google, announced a drop in advertising revenue for the first time since reports began.

Shares in Alphabet Inc. have fallen by more than 9 percent as of 3:00 p.m. eastern today, following these poor reports for the tech company, which reflect a wider downturn in tech stocks.

The Google results point to continued fragility for the digital-advertising industry, which has been clobbered in recent months. Some of Google‚Äôs core properties, including YouTube and search, which have long been drivers of the company‚Äôs overall performance, showed surprising weakness. In a period when the company‚Äôs executives have talked about becoming more disciplined in hiring, Alphabet‚Äôs full-time employee base increased by almost 12,800 workers in the quarter, the biggest change on record. Alphabet shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading. ‚ÄúTimes like this are clarifying,‚Äù said CEO Sundar Pichai, in a call with analysts after earnings were announced. He said Google has begun a push to become more efficient ‚Äúby realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities‚Äù and that employee growth will be ‚Äúsignificantly lower‚Äù in the fourth quarter.

Pichai emphasizing a reduction in employee growth is in line with other trends in the industry. Facebook recently announced a hiring freeze amid continued economic woes, and Amazon plans to close all but one of its U.S.-based customer call centers.

More prominently, Twitter has been in the news over Elon Musk‚Äôs plans to cut 75 percent of the company‚Äôs workforce when he takes over the company, with the acquisition deal currently expected to close at the end of this week. Even if the deal somehow does not go through, Twitter‚Äôs current management was independently planning to cut employee numbers by approximately a quarter.

To save money, companies have been conducting layoffs, eliminating employee perks, such as free laundry service, catered meals and snacks, and pulling back on travel expenses. CFOs are reevaluating the return on investments for their myriad of software tools and tech-subscription services. Hiring freezes and rescinding job offers have become more commonplace compared to a couple of years ago.

Chief executives David Solomon (Goldman Sachs), James Gorman (Morgan Stanley) and Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan) never fully embraced remote work. With a contracting economy, the power dynamic has shifted from employees back to the employer, and the CEOs can call for a return to the office. Workers no longer have the same bargaining power they possessed during the Great Resignation and subsequent labor shortage. The days of employee-centric policies are over, and the bosses are back in charge again.

Going Back To The Office

Bob Iger, the former and now once-again CEO of Disney, made one of his first orders of business to bring back workers to the office four days a week starting March 1. Starbucks‚Äô interim CEO Howard Schultz was displeased that employees disregarded his return-to-office request and is now requiring office workers to return for three days a week.

Elon Musk, upon acquiring Twitter, immediately put an end to former CEOs Jack Dorsey and Parag Agrawal‚Äôs pledges to allow workers at the social media platform to work remotely ‚Äúforever.‚Äù Similarly, he requires employees of SpaceX and Tesla to come into the workplace. Skeptical of working from home, he tweeted last year, ‚ÄúAll the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don‚Äôt actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!‚Äù

Similar to Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù management style, Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff openly complained in a companywide Slack memo that newly hired remote workers are not being productive. He lamented that the subscription-as-a-service leader left the new employees isolated at home without the benefit of an office culture.

In an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs CEO didn‚Äôt mince words about his thoughts on the prevailing permissive work culture, stating that working remotely is ‚Äúnot an employee choice.‚Äù Gorman said, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt get to choose their compensation. They don‚Äôt get to choose their promotion. They don't get to choose to stay home five days a week. I want them with other employees at least three or four days.‚Äù However, despite promoting the return to office, Gorman acknowledged that it's not a one-size-fits-all declaration. Managers need to make decisions on the specific role and circumstances of the employee. ‚ÄúThere are different kinds of jobs. Five days in the office for everybody is not going to happen again.‚Äù

JPMorgan‚Äôs CEO told an audience in Davos that remote work ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work‚Äù for bosses. Dimon, similar to Benioff‚Äôs assertions, said that younger employees are not benefiting from this work style. However, he did offer a caveat, stating that working from home may be helpful to some people. Dimon thinks that business leaders should ""modify your company to help women stay home a little,"" as working mothers disproportionately bear the brunt of childcare. The chief executive is also concerned that people who work remotely may be unfairly targeted for layoffs. On the topic of returning to the office, Dimon acknowledged that ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt like commuting, but so what?‚Äù

Goldman Sachs‚Äô CEO shares the same sentiment as Dimon. Solomon famously said early on during the pandemic that remote work is an ‚Äúaberration.‚Äù Under his remit, a number of young bankers complained that they were forced to work 100 hours a week, which led to alleged sleep deprivation and lack of work-life balance. In response, he increased their compensation and allowed them to take off on Saturdays.

As more layoffs are announced, it's reasonable to conclude that CEOs and executives will flex their muscles. Just as Benioff and Musk make assumptions about the productivity of remote workers, it's logical that they‚Äôll rescind that option. Over-the-top perks and unjustifiable expenses will be reigned in. C-suite management teams will contend that the pandemic-induced changes to the workplace led, in part, to the problems firms are currently facing. Never mind that companies were too optimistic in their excessive hiring, believing the euphoria of ever-increasing stock and real estate prices would continue indefinitely. They overlook this fact and place the blame on supposed lazy remote workers.

This month, banking giant Capital One slashed around 1,100 jobs in its technology department. This is a warning sign that the layoffs and cost cutting in the tech sector will soon spill over into other sectors, as Silicon Valley is usually the canary in the coal mine when it comes to business trends.

It looks like the boom times are over for investment banking, and big layoffs are back on Wall Street. The news of Goldman Sachs laying off 3,200 well-paid, white-collar workers sheds light on the challenging environment on Wall Street. Declines in initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and deal-making have caused a drop in revenue. Global IPO activity fell 45% year-over-year, according to data from Ernst & Young.

Morgan Stanley announced around 1,600 job cuts. Citigroup let go of dozens of people within its investment banking division, as dealmaking continues to slow down. One of the largest money managers in the world, BlackRock, said it would lay off around 500 professionals. Coinbase, a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange, is once again reducing headcount, slashing 950 positions, in its third round of layoffs within a year.

Policy advocates who have been pushing for new legislation reining in Big Tech's power have seen their hopes lifted and shattered several times throughout the past few months.

Last week marked one of the brighter notes for those supporting the push for new antitrust laws, when the House passed a package of bills giving enforcers more resources to go after anti-competitive mergers and giving state attorneys general more power over in which courts they can bring antitrust lawsuits.

While the legislation that passed 242-184 is less ambitious in scope than some of the more sweeping proposals making their way through both chambers of Congress, it is cause for hope, according to a new memo from the Tech Oversight Project, a nonprofit that advocates for antitrust reform.

""Big Tech never loses a legislative fight ‚Äì and they just did,"" Executive Director Sacha Haworth said in a memo to allies Thursday that was shared exclusively with CNBC. Recipients included Democratic offices on Capitol Hill, think tanks and a coalition of advocacy organizations, according to the group.

The Tech Oversight Project receives funding, as The Washington Post has reported, from the Omidyar Network, created by regulation advocate and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and from the advocacy arm of the Economic Security Project, a nonprofit led by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes who has called for his former company's break up.

Haworth, a Democratic political campaign veteran, makes the case that the decisive passage of the legislation last week shows there is still a chance for two other key bills to pass in the lame-duck session later this year. Those bills are the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICO) and the Open App Markets Act (OAMA), which would essentially bar large platforms like Amazon, Apple and Google from favoring their own products over rivals that rely on their marketplaces (the latter bill is focused squarely on mobile app stores).

Earlier this summer, antitrust reform advocates looked to the lame duck only as a Hail Mary, since many felt there was still a chance to schedule a vote before the August recess, an informal marker of when midterm electioneering gets into full swing, making it harder to pass new laws. But as the legislative days ticked away, it became clear advocates would need to refocus their sights on the weeks following the midterms.

According to Haworth, last week's vote provided some reason for optimism.

She notes House Democrats who voted against the package were not among those in the top 20% most competitive districts in the country, based on data from the Cook Political Report. That runs counter to speculation that congressional leaders may be hesitant to schedule a vote on AICO and OAMA to spare Democrats in competitive races from having to vote on an issue that could be used against them.

Haworth goes as far as to say, ""if this voting pattern holds, AICO and OAMA will breeze past both chambers with ease.""

She contends Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., the key Republican champion of tech antitrust reform in the House, delivered on his promise of ""a tidal wave of Republican votes,"" despite opposition from other prominent party members like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.

""Despite attempts by Big Tech to discredit Grassley and Buck's efforts, they proved their hypothesis right: If brought to the full floor, a significant portion of Republicans would cross over to join Democrats in holding Big Tech accountable,"" Haworth wrote, referring to Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has championed the bills in that chamber.

Haworth wrote that the contradictory reasons given by Jordan and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., to oppose antitrust reform should prove that ""their argument is a red herring meant to muddy the waters."" While Jordan contended the bills on the table would help platforms censor information, Lofgren argued it would do the opposite, making it harder for them to moderate content.

Finally, the memo contends that lame-duck legislation is becoming more common, citing a Pew Research Center article from last year that found a significant percentage of legislation passed in recent years has been in the lame-duck period. In the 116th Congress spanning from 2019 to 2020, for example, nearly 44% of bills passed did so in the lame duck.

""Big Tech and their allies will continue to push the narrative that bipartisan antitrust reform is dead,"" Haworth wrote. ""Not so fast. While anti-Big Tech advocates remain clear-eyed about the task at hand, the outcome is not set in stone.""

The broad market index dropped 0.9% during the week, while the Dow fell 1.6%. The Nasdaq Composite had also lost 0.2%. The downward movement comes as investors' concerns on the health of the banking sector and U.S. economy were reignited. Regional bank stocks took a hit when PacWest announced a significant deposit outflows during the first week of May. Concerns of a U.S. government default was was another overhang on market sentiment this week as lawmakers failed to reach a resolution on the debt ceiling. Nonetheless, several stocks managed to beat the market this week. Take a look at this week's top gainers, and where analysts see them going forward. (Data as of early morning trading Friday.) Solar panel manufacturer First Solar emerged as this week's biggest gainer, with shares surging 26.3% as of Friday morning.

Approximately 41% of analysts covering the stock rate it a buy, according to FactSet. To be sure, the stock is already 2.6% above analysts' consensus price target. Shares of chemical manufacturer Albemarle popped 10.6% this week after being upgraded by KeyBanc and Bank of America . KeyBanc cited improving demand for lithium in China for its upgrade and said shares currently sit at an attractive valuation.

Releasing its fifth progress report on digital platforms since it began an inquiry in 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has called for industry-specific legislation, saying it has identified ‚Äúwidespread, entrenched and systematic‚Äù consumer and competition ‚Äúharms‚Äù.

It also wanted digital platforms to be required to provide user-friendly processes for alerting to scams, noting losses reported to Scamwatch from schemes on social networking and mobile apps almost doubled to $92m in 2021.

Google and Facebook have attempted to address competition concerns held by Australian media companies, who objected to the tech giants using their output without paying for it. Agreements have led to millions flowing back to local newsrooms.

But other competition concerns remain, including the way digital platforms preference their own services (particularly in advertising), use data they collect and tie customers to their services.

It comes as Twitter, which has been bought by billionaire Elon Musk, said it would lay off half its staff, including Australian employees, many of whom are involved in moderation.

In its latest six-monthly report, the ACCC said it had ‚Äúidentified concerning consumer and competition harms across a range of digital platform services that are widespread, entrenched, and systemic‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe critical positions that digital platforms hold, as ‚Äògatekeepers‚Äô or ‚Äòintermediaries‚Äô between businesses and consumers, mean they have a broad influence across the economy, making the reforms we are recommending crucial and necessary for all Australians,‚Äù the ACC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.

The report called for legislation requiring digital platforms to provide user-friendly processes for reporting scams, harmful apps and fake reviews, and a proper dispute resolution process to be established.

It said losses reported to Scamwatch from mobile and social media scams almost doubled to $92m in 2021.

‚ÄúThis shows that digital platforms need to do more to stop their users from being scammed,‚Äù Cass-Gottlieb said.

‚ÄúWe also need more action on fake reviews from platforms whose services feature ratings and reviews, including those appearing on search, social media, app stores and online market places,‚Äù she said.

The watchdog said consumers routinely reported difficulties resolving disputes with digital platform companies, with few avenues for contacting and pursuing problems.

It has also recommended a new digital platform ombudsman scheme and wants a verification system for certain business users. Another suggested requirement is for digital platforms to publish their review verification processes.

The ACCC noted similar reforms are occurring overseas and that reform in Australia would align with the global shift towards placing greater onus on digital platforms to be more responsible and responsive.

The report has also proposed mandatory codes of conduct for certain platforms noting that the development of just two or three major players had led to a range of anti-competitive behaviours.

‚ÄúWe are calling for service-specific codes of conduct that apply to designated digital platforms,‚Äù Cass-Gottlieb said.

The ACCC said it had observed a range of conduct being undertaken by the most powerful digital platforms, including self-preferencing, exclusivity agreements, impeding switching and withholding access to important hardware, software and data inputs.

‚ÄúWe are also concerned about lack of transparency and the ability of digital platforms with market power to degrade the quality of the services they offer, including in the terms on which services are provided to business users,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúThe need to prevent and deter such conduct where it reduces competition is a major focus of this report.‚Äù

It also cited the hundreds of acquisitions made by platforms such as Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, many involving nascent or potential competitors.

The digital platforms have also been asked to develop a separate code to deal with fake news under the auspices of the Australian Communications and Media Authority. It too has come under criticism for being too restrictive.

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government was considering the ACCC‚Äôs latest recommendations and would consult publicly to ensure Australia has the right regulations in place to be a leading digital economy.

‚ÄúThe Albanese government is already strengthening consumer protections, including through recently introduced legislation to prohibit unfair contract terms and increase penalties for anti-competitive behaviour, and has committed to establish a new National Anti-Scam Centre,‚Äù he said.",Australia's consumer watchdog calls for new laws to stop scams and rein in anti-competitive ...,non-causal,"ACCC, ACC","['STEM', 'S', 'U']",[],"['ACC', 'ACCC']","['GILD', 'U', 'STEM', 'S', 'ACC', 'ACCC']",-0.99850434

The stock rose 4.2%, resulting in a US$206m rise in the company's market capitalisation. Put another way, the original US$203k acquisition is now worth US$213k.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

Antero Midstream Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

The CFO, VP of Finance & Treasurer Brendan Krueger made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$105k worth of shares at a price of US$10.54 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$10.67. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Antero Midstream insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.

Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 20.00k shares worth US$203k. But insiders sold 7.50k shares worth US$79k. Overall, Antero Midstream insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Antero Midstream insiders own 2.7% of the company, worth about US$139m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.

What Might The Insider Transactions At Antero Midstream Tell Us?

The fact that there have been no Antero Midstream insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Antero Midstream insiders feel good about the company's future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

The Commission preliminarily found that Google‚Äôs advertising technology services have for at least almost a decade broken the European Union‚Äôs antitrust laws because Google ‚Äúself-preferences‚Äù these services and tools, essentially freezing out competitors. That gives Google the ability to charge higher advertising fees, and this leads to higher prices for consumers, according to the Commission.

‚ÄúGoogle is active on both sides of the market with its publisher ad server and with its ad buying tools and holds a dominant position on both ends,‚Äù the Commission stated. ‚ÄúFurthermore, it operates the largest ad exchange.‚Äù

If the Commission ultimately finds that Google is indeed at fault, the Commission said, ‚Äúa behavioral remedy‚Äù would be unlikely enough to cure the problem.

‚ÄúThe Commission‚Äôs preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns,‚Äù the Commission said.

This is the fourth time the Commission has accused Google of violating European Union antitrust laws, according to The New York Times.

While the Commission‚Äôs preliminary findings didn‚Äôt single out travel advertisers in particular, they would be affected in a manner similar to advertisers in other industries. That also goes for travelers, who face inflated trip costs because of higher advertising prices.

In response to the Commission‚Äôs statement of objections, Dan Taylor, vice president of Google Ads, said in a prepared statement: ‚ÄúOur advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers. Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The Commission‚Äôs investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the EC‚Äôs view and we will respond accordingly.‚Äù

Booking‚Äôs Pending Acquisition of Etraveli Is In the Crosshairs

The Commission‚Äôs preliminary objections to Booking Holdings‚Äô acquisition of Sweden-based Etraveli Group are more directly travel-related. That deal has been pending since November 2021 when Booking announced its proposed acquisition of private equity firm CVC Capital Partners-owned Etraveli for around $1.8 billion.

The Commission undertook an in-depth look at this deal in November 2022, and some ‚Äî but not necessarily all ‚Äî of its concerns seem a head-scratcher.

The committee found that Booking.com is the dominant online travel agency in the European zone. That‚Äôs true, but some of the concerns focus on Booking‚Äôs position in hotels.

The Commission stated the acquisition would: ‚ÄúStrengthen Booking‚Äôs dominant position in the hotel OTA market further, increasing its bargaining position towards hotels and diverting demand from cheaper alternative sales channels. Competition is already limited in the hotel OTA market and Booking appears to be unconstrained by competing OTAs, hotels and end customers.‚Äù

The ‚Äúunconstrained by competing OTAs‚Äù mention seems to downplay the role of Google, which operates a robust hotel advertising business in Europe.

Meanwhile, Etraveli indeed operates several online travel agencies such as GoToGate and MyTrip, which offer hotels, as well as flights and rental cars. But these two brands already source their hotels from Booking.com, and they, as well as other brands in the Etraveli Group, focus on flights, not hotels, and the air business is the main reason Booking wants the deal.

Unlike Booking Holdings‚Äô Priceline brand, which offered flights from day one in 1997, Booking.com only launched flights just before the pandemic, and expanding its flights business is Booking‚Äôs prime motivation behind the deal.

The acquisition would likely only improve Booking‚Äôs hotel business around the edges. And when it comes to any consumer harm, it should be noted that hotels are the ones that set rates ‚Äî not Booking.com.

Still, the Commission believes that the deal would: ‚ÄúAllow Booking to expand its ecosystem of travel services (e.g., flights, accommodation, car rentals, attractions), making its market position in the hotel OTA market more difficult to contest.‚Äù

When considering these two Commission statements of objections against Google and Booking, it appears as though Google has the tougher hill to climb. Still, at this point ‚Äî although there will be a lot of negotiating to come ‚Äî it seems like Booking‚Äôs eventual and much-coveted acquisition of ETraveli Group is very much in doubt.

If the agency does move ahead with a case, it could come as soon as next month, said the people, all of whom were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter.

Central to the FTC‚Äôs concerns is whether acquiring Activision would give Microsoft an unfair boost in the video game market. Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox is number three to the industry-leading Sony Interactive Entertainment and its PlayStation console. Sony, however, has emerged as the deal‚Äôs primary opponent, telling the FTC and regulators in other countries that if Microsoft made hit games like Call of Duty exclusive to its platforms Sony would be significantly disadvantaged.

In an October statement to the UK‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority outlining Sony‚Äôs position, and published Wednesday, Sony says the deal will not only harm its ability to compete but will also leave consumers with less choice for gaming and developers with less choice for where to publish games. Microsoft is a ‚ÄúTech Titan buying up irreplaceable content at incontestable prices ($68.7 billion) to tip competition to itself,‚Äù Sony said.

In its own statement, also released by the UK regulator on Wednesday, Microsoft accuses Sony of making self-serving statements to maintain its number one position in gaming. ‚ÄúThe suggestion that the incumbent market leader, Sony, with clear and enduring market power, could be foreclosed by the smallest of the three console competitors, Xbox, as a result of losing access to one title, is not credible.‚Äù

Microsoft said it has repeatedly promised to keep Call of Duty available on Sony‚Äôs PlayStation, and furthermore, the game is not the must-have Sony says it is. Additionally, Microsoft notes that the game is not currently available on any subscription service, and adding it to the Xbox service in the future would not harm Sony.

To a lesser extent, Google is also an opponent of the deal, according to two of the people with knowledge of the matter. The company has argued that Microsoft has purposely degraded the quality of its Game Pass subscription service when used with Google‚Äôs Chrome operating system, and owning Activision would further its incentive to do so, ultimately steering hardware sales towards Microsoft and away from Google, the people said.

Google is a minor player in the gaming industry and is winding down its own online gaming service Stadia. However, it is under antitrust scrutiny around the world, including for conduct in the gaming market, and is unlikely to be a sympathetic opponent. Fortnite maker Epic Games is currently suing Google, arguing that it is illegally blocking Fortnite from its mobile app store Google Play. As part of that case, Epic recently accused Google of paying Activision $360 million to not offer a competing app store on Android phones.

Microsoft has pledged to continue making Call of Duty available on Sony‚Äôs Playstation console, and recently made an offer to give Sony access to the game for the next 10 years. The offer was first reported by the New York Times. It‚Äôs not known how Sony responded to the offer and it did not respond for comment on Wednesday.

The FTC‚Äôs concerns however extend beyond Call of Duty, and investigators are trying to determine how Microsoft could leverage future, unannounced titles to boost its gaming business, according to two people with knowledge of the review.

‚ÄúAny suggestion that the transaction could lead to anticomp effects is completely absurd. This merger will benefit gamers and the US gaming industry, especially as we face increasingly stiff competition from abroad,‚Äù said Activision spokesperson Joe Christinat. ‚ÄúWe are committed to continuing to work cooperatively with regulators around the globe to allow the transaction to proceed, but will not hesitate to fight to defend the transaction if required.‚Äù

Microsoft spokesperson David Cuddy said the company ‚Äúis prepared to address the concerns of regulators, including the FTC, and Sony to ensure the deal closes with confidence. We‚Äôll still trail Sony and Tencent in the market after the deal closes, and together Activision and Xbox will benefit gamers and developers and make the industry more competitive.‚Äù

The FTC technically does not have to take any action at this point. Regulators in Europe and the UK have also recently opened in-depth probes, meaning the companies couldn‚Äôt close the deal until the Spring at the earliest. That means if the FTC does sue, it would likely bring a case in its own in-house administrative court.

The agency typically challenges deals first in federal court to block them with a temporary injunction pending a trial in its in-house court. Without the imminent risk of the deal closing, however, it would be difficult to get a temporary injunction.

The companies have until July next year to close the deal without renegotiating the agreement.

‚Ä¢ Meta ended the last quarter with 87,314 employees, an increase of 28% year-over-year.
‚Ä¢ Microsoft had 221,000 employees, up 22.1% from a year ago.
‚Ä¢ Alphabet reported 186,779 employees at the end of September, up 24% from the 150,028 workers it had a year earlier.
‚Ä¢ Apple's headcount grew, but less substantially than those companies. As of Sept. 24, Apple had approximately 164,000 workers, up 6.5% from the prior year's 154,000.
‚Ä¢ Amazon, too, showed more modest growth, ending the quarter with 1,544,000 workers, up 5% from the 1,468,000 people it employed a year ago.

What they're saying: Matt Perault, director of UNC‚Äôs Center on Technology Policy, told Axios that it's not just the employees hired in the last year, but also the large growth seen in the past few years.
‚Ä¢ For example, he said, Meta has doubled in employee size between the end of 2018 and the end of 2021.""It‚Äôs not clear to me that the hiring has resulted in increased impact or innovation at a pace commensurate with the increased costs,"" Perault said.
‚Ä¢ ""I would imagine that the companies can impose some headcount cuts without seeing a meaningful negative impact on their productivity.""

Between the lines: In some cases, those growth numbers include acquisitions, such as Google's acquisition of Mandiant or Microsoft's purchase of Nuance, which also bring added revenue.

‚Ä¢ Students selected five employers that they most want to work for these rankings.

Business students from around the world hope they can work at Apple.

That's according to the latest ranking from Universum, an employer branding expert. Universum published its annual rankings of the World's Most Attractive Employers, one of which focuses on where business students are highly interested in working.

Universum said that the rankings are based on the ""top nine and most significant graduate hiring countries for multinational employers: USA, China, Germany, UK, France, India, Italy, Brazil, Canada. To be considered, companies must be among the top 90% of brands listed in at least four of the nine countries."" Students were asked, ""Choose the five employers you most want to work for, your five Ideal Employers."" The business standing ranking was determined this year by almost 90,000 business students from across the world.

Tech companies Apple, Google, and Microsoft made up this year's top three spots in the business student ranking.

""Among the highest-scoring employers in the WMAE rankings, Apple was the biggest winner in 2022 ‚Äî and particularly so for business students, who pushed the brand from the No.3 spot to No.1,"" Kortney Kutsop, managing director for Universum Americas, said in a statement. ""The company's consumer privacy moves in 2022 were viewed favorably by young talent, and its recent strong financial performance ‚Äî even as some of Apple's competitors falter ‚Äî will likely sustain the employer brand's position into 2023.""

Apple also ranked third in the engineering and IT student rankings, suggesting that students from various fields see Apple as a top potential place to work.

Accounting and consulting giant Deloitte ranked sixth in this business student ranking; it also ranked No. 14 in the IT student ranking this year.

""We are honored to once again be recognized as a top employer by talent entering the workforce,"" Michele Parmelee, Deloitte Global deputy CEO and chief people and purpose officer, said in a statement. ""Deloitte remains committed to supporting and inspiring our people throughout their career journeys. By providing opportunities, resources, and an inclusive culture, we are enabling our people to continue making an impact for their clients and communities.""

L'Or√©al Group also ranked toward the top of the business student ranking.

""We are very honored to be ranked No. 5 for Business Students, standing out alongside the tech giants and the first European company in the ranking,"" Michael Kienle, global VP of talent acquisition at L'Or√©al Group, said in a statement.

""Our people-driven culture, which has always been our driving force, resonates with the aspirations of young people who want to grow and have a voice in an inclusive and entrepreneurial environment, while having an impact on society and the planet,"" Kienle continued. ""At L'Or√©al, everyone contributes to a common and unique experience, that of creating beauty that moves the world.""

Why it matters: One of the biggest benefits of the move is that each is now freed to focus on its own growth strategy, says a source familiar with the situation.
‚Ä¢ In the case of Alibaba, it also makes a split-up or spinoff of its units easier if it were to face further regulatory scrutiny.

Details: The new company holding structure is meant to mirror that of Alphabet, the parent of Google, the source notes.
‚Ä¢ With the review complete, no further moves are being contemplated at this time, the source says.
‚Ä¢ The source iterated that the businesses are now free to raise capital or to go public, as has been reported, or to seek partners or stand pat, among other options.

Be smart: The company announced the reorganization in March because it begins its fiscal year in April, CEO Daniel Zhang said during an investor call.
‚Ä¢ ""The management teams of the business groups will be working on planning and mapping out strategy, of course, not just for the coming year but for the coming years,"" he added.

Of note: Of the six businesses, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group will remain a wholly owned unit of Alibaba Group.

Flashback: After Alibaba founder Jack Ma publicly critiqued the Chinese government, both his e-commerce business and his fintech operation, Ant Group, came under intense regulatory scrutiny.
‚Ä¢ Ant Group's planned IPO for late 2020 was canceled and Alibaba was fined roughly $2.8 billion in 2021 for hindering competition.
‚Ä¢ In January the Chinese government took ""golden shares"" in Alibaba, with Ma ceding control.

Catch up fast: China strengthened its anti-monopoly law last year in part by increasing penalties.
‚Ä¢ More recently investors in the U.S. filed a lawsuit against Alibaba accusing the company of misleading them on merchant exclusivity.

Between the lines: We've seen tech companies in the U.S. such as Alphabet and Meta reorganize.

Procter & Gamble reported a dip in quarterly profits Thursday, following a decline in sales as the consumer products giant offset lower volumes with price increases.

Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. The Washington Housing Conservancy purchased the 10-story, 212-unit Loree Grand apartment community for $71.5 million, with loans from Amazon‚Äôs Housing Equity Fund, EagleBank and the Washington Housing Initiative Impact Pool, an investment vehicle managed by developer JBG Smith.

The building, located at 250 K St. NE in NoMa, consists of studio, one- and two-bedroom units, almost all of which are market-rate apartments. According to its website, a new tenant can pay from $1,700 to $3,500 a month for a studio apartment.

WHC said the purchase enables it to stabilize rents for moderate-income workers and their families. The nonprofit will preserve for 99 years the Loree Grand‚Äôs existing 30 affordable units created under the city‚Äôs Inclusionary Zoning program. The city limits the rent on those units based on the renter‚Äôs income. WHC said it will create an additional 129 affordable units for residents earning up to 80 percent of the area median income and set aside the remaining 53 units for residents earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.

Such income limits are typical of workforce housing programs aimed at helping essential workers such as teachers, nurses and police officers. The area median income in D.C. in 2022 is $142,300, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

WHC said that no residents will be forced to vacate the property and that it will meet its affordability goals over several years through a combination of current residents, vacancies and turnover.

The acquisition is the latest financed by Amazon‚Äôs Housing Equity Fund. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Amazon launched the fund in January 2021 with $2 billion and a goal of preserving and creating more than 20,000 affordable homes in and around Nashville, Seattle and Arlington, Va., where it is building its second headquarters.

Critics have complained that the fund has not done enough to help the poorest renters. As of April, it had spent about $750 million. The overwhelming majority of the money has gone to help people earning more than 50 percent of area median income, according to a Washington Post analysis of company data.

Housing Equity Fund officials have said that Amazon alone can‚Äôt solve the affordable-housing crisis but can partner with governments. Amazon-funded deals have reportedly increased Arlington‚Äôs supply of affordable housing by 22 percent.

‚ÄúWith tremendous support from Amazon and its Housing Equity Fund and the Impact Pool, we are preserving long-term affordability in diverse, high opportunity neighborhoods under tremendous redevelopment pressure,‚Äù WHC Executive Director Kimberly Driggins said in a news release. ‚ÄúAnd we ensure that more middle-income earners ‚Äî like first responders, hospitality workers, and teachers ‚Äî are relieved of the rent burdens that make it hard to save money and build wealth for their future.‚Äù","D.C. luxury building becoming workforce housing, with Amazon ...",non-causal,"DMV, JBG, NE, WHC","['P', 'G']",[],"['NE', 'DMV', 'WHC', 'JBG']","['NE', 'PG', 'G', 'P', 'DMV', 'WHC', 'JBG']",-0.99982464

In a blog accompanying the announcement, it asked users to try the AI and provide feedback. The company warned that Bard can get some things wrong because LLMs ‚Äúlearn from a wide range of information that reflects real-world biases and stereotypes.‚Äù

It is true that these AI models reflect large swaths of data that we, as Internet users, have generated, and perhaps that‚Äôs why when Bard was asked if it would side with the Justice Department or Google in the lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital advertising technologies,‚Äù the automated system wrote when prompted by Jane Manchum Wong, who posted a screenshot of the exchange on Twitter. ‚ÄúI would side with the Justice Department in this case.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoogle has a monopoly on the digital advertising market, and this has allowed the company to engage in anticompetitive behavior.

Motherboard tested Bard with the same prompt and the chatbot provided us with a similar response: ‚ÄúBased on the information I have found, it seems that the Justice Department has a strong case against Google. Google has been accused of using its dominant position in the digital advertising market to stifle competition and harm consumers. If these allegations are true, then Google should be held accountable for its actions.‚Äù

‚ÄúUltimately, it is up to the courts to decide who is right in this case. However, I believe that the Justice Department has made a strong case against Google and that the company should be held accountable for its actions if these allegations are true,‚Äù Google‚Äôs AI concluded.

The Justice Department sued Google in late January of this year, in its second lawsuit since 2020. A previous lawsuit, filed in October 2020, alleged that Google had maintained an unlawful monopoly in the search engine market. This most recent lawsuit alleged that Google had engaged in anticompetitive conduct that eliminated ad tech competitors through acquisitions and forced publishers and advertisers to use its products for the last fifteen years.

‚ÄúThe complaint filed today alleges a pervasive and systemic pattern of misconduct through which Google sought to consolidate market power and stave off free-market competition,‚Äù Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said in a press release. ‚ÄúIn pursuit of outsized profits, Google has caused great harm to online publishers and advertisers and American consumers. This lawsuit marks an important milestone in the Department‚Äôs efforts to hold big technology companies accountable for violations of the antitrust laws.‚Äù

Justices subsequently heard arguments in a similar case, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Cochran, about securities regulators that challenged federal enforcement agencies' in-house courts. Agencies including the FTC and the SEC utilize administrative courts that allow agency-employed judges to rule on the legality of mergers or determine punishments over alleged violations of consumer or securities laws.

Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath & Beyond files for bankruptcy.

High-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.

Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.

Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.

Last week, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic ""storm clouds"" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.

On Monday, U.S. stocks were seen opening lower. By 04:41 ET (08:41 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 109 points or 0.32%, S&P 500 futures traded 16 points or 0.40% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped by 57 points or 0.44%.

Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG).

The bank called the outflows ""significant,"" adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.

It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.

The results, which analysts at KBW called ""alarming,"" set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.

""UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor,"" analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.

NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.

In a statement, Shell said he had had an ""inappropriate relationship"" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.

""Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal,"" Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.

Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.

Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.

U.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.

The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.

But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath & Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.

Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.

The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath & Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.

Oil prices dropped, extending their recent decline into this week, as traders eyed a darkening outlook for global demand.

Concerns remain that rising interest rates will lead to a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the U.S. economy, the world's biggest consumer of crude.

By 04:17 EST (08:17 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.51% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 0.56% to $81.00 per barrel.

Last week, crude markets slumped to their first weekly loss in five, after data showed that the U.S. implied gasoline demand dropped by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.","Earnings wave, Credit Suisse outflows, BBBY bankruptcy - what's moving markets",causal,"CHF, UBS, CEO, EST, SIX, MDLZ, LLY, GMT, UBSG, BBBY, ET, INTC, JPM, MA, GOOG, META, CSGN, KBW, NYSE, AG, XOM, AMZN, KO",['A'],['A'],"['LLY', 'JPM', 'ET', 'CEO', 'MDLZ', 'CHF', 'AG', 'KO', 'KBW', 'NYSE', 'META', 'GMT', 'INTC', 'AMZN', 'MA', 'UBS', 'BBBY', 'CSGN', 'XOM', 'GOOG', 'SIX', 'UBSG', 'EST']","['LLY', 'JPM', 'ET', 'CEO', 'MDLZ', 'CHF', 'AG', 'KO', 'KBW', 'NYSE', 'META', 'GMT', 'INTC', 'AMZN', 'MA', 'UBS', 'BBBY', 'TSN', 'CSGN', 'XOM', 'GOOG', 'SIX', 'UBSG', 'A', 'EST']",0.9949575

Shares of the company rose more than 27% Thursday, after Meta beat on revenue and earnings expectations.

What‚Äôs more, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company is undergoing a ‚Äúyear of efficiency‚Äù and cut capital and operational expenditure expectations for the year while approving a $40 billion stock buyback.

That‚Äôs all well and good for Meta, but the outlook for the social network‚Äôs advertising business, which accounted for $31.2 billion in revenue of its $32.1 billion revenue last quarter, is still incredibly cloudy. You‚Äôd think with the sense of Meta euphoria emanating from the Street that the company‚Äôs ad troubles were behind it, but that‚Äôs not the case.

Ad revenue for the company fell year-over-year to $31.2 billion in Q4 2022 from $32.6 billion in the same quarter last year.

During Meta‚Äôs Q4 earnings call, CFO Susan Li, laid out just what kinds of problems the company continues to face.

‚ÄúQ4 revenue remained under pressure from weak advertising demand, which we believe continues to be impacted by the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape,‚Äù she said.

While Meta says that investments it has made into its ad platform are helping advertisers, the company is still contending with ad targeting problems caused by Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) App Tracking Technology privacy feature. The offering, which rolled out in 2021, allows consumers to opt out of letting third-party apps like Facebook or Instagram from tracking their activity across the web and other apps.

‚ÄúWe are continuing to make progress in mitigating the impact from the [App Tracking Transparency] change, but this is more generally, just the reality of the online advertising environment that we operate in now,‚Äù Li explained. ‚ÄúSo we're continuing to work on building tools that mitigate the impact of those changes and we see strong adoption of those tools.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just Meta, either. During Snap‚Äôs (SNAP) earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel told analysts that advertising demand hasn‚Äôt improved, but it hasn‚Äôt gotten ‚Äúsignificantly worse, either.‚Äù The CEO chalked the problem up to advertisers managing their budgets at a time of economic uncertainty.

Microsoft (MSFT) also reported weakness in its advertising business, CFO Amy Hood explained during the company‚Äôs latest earnings report.

‚ÄúAdvertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions,‚Äù Hood said. And while Search and news advertising revenue increased 10% ex-traffic acquisition costs, it was lower than the company had anticipated.

It may take some time for the ad market to fully recover too. In a recent research note, Jefferies analyst James Heaney says the Street is overly optimistic with regards to growth in the industry in 2023 and 2024.

‚ÄúOur assumptions are based on the fact that global ad spend and GDP are highly correlated and [Jefferies] economists forecast a recession from Q3'23 ‚Äî Q3'24,‚Äù Heaney wrote. ‚ÄúWe expect another round of estimate cuts in Q4, as companies provide more negative-than-expected guidance for Q1 and FY23.‚Äù

For now, shares of Meta are on the rise. How long that lasts, though, is an open question.

Discovery and Amazon that extends at least through the end of 2024, customers who subscribe to HBO Max through Prime Video Channels in the U.S. will automatically be upgraded to the forthcoming consolidated HBO Max/Discovery+ service next spring.

HBO Max‚Äôs return to Prime Video Channels comes after the premium streamer, under WarnerMedia, dropped off Prime Video Channels in September 2021, after the media company and Amazon failed to reach an agreement to extend the distribution pact. The sticking point: WarnerMedia, then owned by AT&T, wanted more control of the direct-to-consumer relationships ‚Äî including the ability to collect data for targeted advertising ‚Äî than Amazon was willing to cede. About 5 million HBO/HBO Max customers had subscribed through Prime Video Channels, and the end of that deal took a bite out of HBO Max‚Äôs subscriber base.

Now, as of Tuesday (Dec. 6), HBO Max is once again on Prime Video Channels in the U.S. under the multiyear deal between Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery (formed by Discovery‚Äôs acquisition of WarnerMedia this year).

Business terms of the deal weren‚Äôt disclosed. In a statement about the new Prime Video Channels deal, Bruce Campbell, Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs chief revenue and strategy officer, noted that ‚ÄúWarner Bros. Discovery is committed to making HBO Max available to as broad an audience as possible while also advancing our data-driven approach to understanding our customers and best serving their viewing interests. Today, we are thrilled to take an important step forward by announcing that HBO Max is returning to Prime Video Channels.‚Äù

Prime members can sign up for HBO Max for $14.99 per month, the same price as through other platforms, through the Prime Video app or by visiting amazon.com/channels/hbomax. Additionally, subscribers will have access to Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs combined HBO Max/Discovery+ streaming service when it launches, targeted for the spring of 2023. WBD has not said whether existing HBO Max customers on other platforms also will be migrated to the merged service, which is reportedly likely to end up being called ‚ÄúMax.‚Äù Nor has the company released pricing details, including whether customers who subscribe to HBO Max through Prime Video Channels will see their monthly fee increase with the HBO Max/Discovery+ fusion.

‚ÄúWe strive to offer customers the best and widest selection of premium content available for their everyday viewing experience,‚Äù Cem Sibay, VP of Prime Video, said in a statement. ‚ÄúNow with the addition of HBO Max again, customers can easily add this subscription and enjoy even more award-winning and fan-favorite entertainment on Prime Video.‚Äù

HBO Max provides about 15,000 hours of content, aggregating original programming from HBO, Warner Bros. and DC, as well as HBO Max originals and films and licensed third-party content. Under Warner Bros. Discovery, the service has cut back on some content spending.

Warner Bros. Discovery does not break out HBO/HBO Max sub numbers in its quarterly reports. In Q3, its direct-to-consumer subscribers inched up 2.8 million worldwide across HBO, HBO Max, Discovery+ and smaller DTC streaming services, to reach 94.9 million.

Their performance is striking compared with ad agencies‚Äô plight five years ago: Facebook and Google had established direct relationships with marketers and were winning growing portions of their ad budgets before agencies could even offer their services. More consumers were ‚Äúcutting the cord‚Äù with traditional television, pressuring the agencies‚Äô income from making and placing TV commercials. And on top of it all, new competition emerged: Advertising-technology and marketing-technology firms were offering new data services for marketers, while consulting firms had set their sights on the advertising business.

Some major owners of ad agencies watched their growth slow or flatten in 2017 and 2018.

Instead of being relegated to the sidelines, however, they have since been bolstered by the advent of new challenges for marketers. This includes the continued splintering of mass media, soaring demand for e-commerce during the Covid-19 pandemic, and moves by Apple that have undermined the effectiveness of ad targeting on Facebook and other platforms, analysts and executives said.

‚ÄúThe complexity and the fragmentation that has only increased in the ad market over the last many years has actually just fed into the capabilities and the expertise of the ad holding companies,‚Äù said Tim Nollen, a senior media tech analyst at Macquarie.

Agency holding companies including WPP PLC, Interpublic Group of Cos., Publicis Groupe SA, and Omnicom Group Inc. have overhauled their businesses to help clients with services such as managing first-party data‚Äîthe information that marketers directly collect on consumers as opposed to the third-party data now under pressure from Google, which plans to eliminate third-party tracking in its web browser, and Apple.

Agencies are also helping with e-commerce as brands increasingly seek to sell directly to consumers.

‚ÄúClients will come to us and say today, ‚ÄòHow do I succeed on Amazon ?‚Äô‚Äù said Mark Read, chief executive of WPP, which owns agencies including Ogilvy, Wunderman Thompson and VMLY&R as well as media-buying business GroupM. ‚Äú‚ÄòHow do I build brands on social media? How do I protect my reputation on the web? How do I build stronger employee engagement? What‚Äôs my mobile experience? How do I build direct‚Äìto‚Äìconsumer [offerings]?‚Äô Those are all questions that they weren‚Äôt asking, and we weren‚Äôt answering, 10 years ago.‚Äù

To help answer those demands, some agency holding companies made major acquisitions: IPG agreed to buy data-management company Acxiom Marketing Solutions for $2.3 billion in 2018, while Publicis Groupe acquired marketing-services firm Epsilon in a deal valued at $4.4 billion in 2019. Firms sharpened up in areas such as precision marketing to help businesses reach consumers directly through digital platforms, and bulked up their data and technology offerings.

To be sure, marketers take a broad range of approaches to their strategies and the way they work with outside players, with some major brands choosing to handle some marketing functions largely in-house. Agencies are also facing the possibility of reduced marketing budgets from some clients if economic conditions worsen in 2023.

But each new riddle for marketers gives agencies an opening, executives said.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google are commanding smaller portions of ad budgets as marketers also spend on alternatives such as Amazon.com Inc. and ByteDance Inc.‚Äôs TikTok.

Google took 34.7% of U.S. digital ad spending in 2017, while Facebook Inc.‚Äînow known as Meta‚Äîtook 20%, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. By 2023, Google will collect 26.5% of U.S. digital ad spending and Meta will garner 18.4%, Insider Intelligence estimates.

Agency companies have responded by building practices to help marketers on platforms like TikTok and Amazon.

‚ÄúIt feels like the era of the Facebook-Google ad duopoly is over,‚Äù MoffettNathanson analysts wrote in a September note. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs good for the agencies.‚Äù

Many marketers today need to spread funds across a broad range of platforms and navigate convoluted sets of data to reach the right consumers, MoffettNathanson said. ‚ÄúEvery agency now has a lucrative ‚Äòdigital transformation‚Äô business helping legacy companies collect, organize, and analyze that data,‚Äù the analysts wrote.

Marketers also are confronting a proliferation of advertising venues from retailers and other businesses with direct consumer interactions, often incorporating their own customer data. Walmart lets advertisers use its data to target ads to shoppers across the web, for example. DoorDash, Kroger, Marriott and CVS Health run data-driven ad networks as well.

Net ad revenues from such retail media advertising in the U.S., which exclude some costs involved with traffic acquisition, will grow to more than $55 billion in 2024 from $37 billion this year, Insider Intelligence estimates.

The more platforms that marketers want to use, the more likely they are to seek help from partners such as ad agencies, who can help spread their dollars, said Andrew Lipsman, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

Some newer agency specialties like IT implementation and business transformation may handle a downturn better than the core competencies of the past, since they don‚Äôt involve media budgets and are less susceptible to macroeconomic trends, said Mr. Nollen, the Macquarie analyst.

Macquarie forecasts on average that the ad holding companies will see a 1% decline in organic revenue growth in 2023, versus the roughly 5% to 10% decline they saw in prior recessionary periods of 2001-02 and 2008-09.

Some major marketers still want to keep a close handle on some of their data efforts.

‚ÄúWhile I know agencies are providing more consulting-like work‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to be beholden to any agency necessarily,‚Äù said Brad Feinberg, North America vice president of media and consumer engagement at Molson Coors Beverage Co.

But even large companies such as Molson Coors has partners like S4 Capital ‚Äòs Media.Monks to help with data capabilities and prepare for marketplace changes related to privacy, Mr. Feinberg said.

Jill Weiss, associate vice president of digital and traditional media at Royal Caribbean Group, said IPG‚Äôs Mediahub, which the company has worked with since 2015, has expanded disciplines such as programmatic trading, social media and advanced analytics and modeling.

A press conference is scheduled for 2PM ET to announce the lawsuit.

‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google‚Äôs few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,‚Äù the lawsuit reads.

It goes on to allege that Google‚Äôs various acquisitions allowed it to ‚Äúneutralize or eliminate‚Äù competitors. According to the government‚Äôs lawyers, when you add up the alleged anti-competitive moves, ‚Äúthese interrelated and interdependent actions have had a cumulative and synergistic effect that has harmed competition and the competitive process.‚Äù

Google knew this was coming.

But instead of making it a separate company altogether, the move would‚Äôve put the division under the umbrella of Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet.

That and the other concessions Google reportedly offered obviously weren‚Äôt enough to convince the DOJ that it‚Äôs not engaging in anti-competitive practices.

Michael Engel joins White & Case‚Äôs global antitrust group in London after two years at Chicago-founded Kirkland & Ellis, and over a decade at Sullivan & Cromwell before that.

A ‚Äútoughening approach‚Äù and ‚Äúincreased intervention‚Äù by UK‚Äôs antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, coupled with new legislative proposals, is leading to a growing client demand for antitrust work, White & Case‚Äôs global head of antitrust Mark Gidley said in a statement.

The CMA on Wednesday blocked Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard over concerns it would hinder competition in cloud gaming.

Engel has advised Fiat Chrysler Automobiles on its $50 billion merger with PSA Group, Bayer on its $66 billion acquisition of Monsanto, Teva Pharmaceuticals on its $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan‚Äôs generics business and satellite company Intelsat on its $7 billion restructuring, according to his Kirkland bio.

The European Commission, the EU‚Äôs antitrust watchdog, is expected to file charges against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) as soon as Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg report that cited sources familiar with the matter.

Regulators there, like those in the US, plan to dispute the legality of Google‚Äôs online advertising business, which controls most of the technology to buy, sell, and serve advertisements online.

The threats represent a danger to a big portion of Alphabet's business. In 2022, ad sales drove approximately 80% of approximately $224.5 billion in revenue.

In the European Union, Google and other major tech firms must adhere to newly enacted laws that promote competition ‚Äì The Digital Markets Act, and a companion law, the Digital Services Act. Penalties for violations of the laws can range up to 10% of a company's global revenue.

The new laws seek to enhance competition by prohibiting large tech companies from favoring their own products and services over those from third parties, and also require enhanced transparency.

The potential EU action adds to Alphabet's legal troubles. US antitrust authorities and US states have also filed antitrust lawsuits against the company.

In January, the US Justice Department and eight US states brought an action saying Google unlawfully leveraged its monopoly in the $278.6 billion online advertising market to block competitors from entering. Nine additional states have since joined in the litigation.

The Justice Department also alleges in a separate suit filed against Google in 2021 that the company is illegally operating an illegal monopoly in the online search business.

In its dispute over Google‚Äôs advertising business, the DOJ is asking the court to order Google's divestment of certain ad tech entities, specifically its Ad Manager suite, which would include its publisher ad server DFT, also known as DoubleClick or GAM, and its ad exchange AdX.

Even before the EU's latest laws took effect, the European Commission assessed significant antitrust fines against Google. About a decade ago the regulator imposed a $10 billion penalty for blocking search engines from its Android phones.

Years later in 2017, 2018, and 2019 the Commission targeted Google for allegedly abusing its market dominance in online search, mobile device apps, and online advertising, respectively.

In 2019, the Commission fined Google 1.5 billion Euros for adding restrictive clauses in its contracts with third-parties. The Commission said the terms blocked rivals from placing search adverts on certain websites.

Regulators in the US have looked into Google before. In 2013, the FTC declined to take action against Google after an agency investigation into its search business.

The decision followed a $22.5 million fine imposed on the company the prior year to settle claims that it violated a privacy settlement with the FTC agreeing that it would avoid placing ‚Äúcookies‚Äù on and serving targeted advertisements to users of Apple‚Äôs competing browser company Safari.

Alphabet isn't the only big tech company under new pressure from regulators. The Federal Trade Commission will soon file a lawsuit seeking to squash Microsoft‚Äôs (MSFT) planned acquisition of ‚ÄúCall of Duty‚Äù maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

The suit, which the FTC will file Monday, would prevent the Xbox maker from completing its deal to buy Activision Blizzard until the commission wraps up its own lawsuit against the move.

The FTC filed its original lawsuit objecting to the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal in December 2022, saying it would, ""enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.""

That‚Äôs the message implicit in the latest disappointing financial reports from the marquee platforms ‚Äî Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook).

Alphabet recently reported weaker-than-expected third quarter earnings and hinted that a turnaround was not in sight. Meta reported that ad demand was weak and its average ad price fell 18% year-over-year. In a CNN report, analyst Evelyn Mitchell called the Google news, ‚Äúa bad omen for digital advertising at large.‚Äù

The weakening economy was a factor, as was e-commerce‚Äôs flattening share of the consumer wallet. But the principal problem facing the ad platforms is the fact that digital advertising has gotten expensive. By some measures, customer acquisition costs in the consumer space have risen by about 60% over the past decade. Clicking on ad links is no longer an efficient way to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù customers.

Retailers like Walmart, Target, and CVS have responded by going into the advertising business, competing with the majors by offering ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù ad space on their websites for vendor merchandise. Amazon was a leader in that category and by 2021 its ad business was generating annual revenue of $31 billion, a 100% increase in one year.

What caught our attention recently was the announcement by Airbnb that it was having success with a new strategy ‚Äî cutting its performance ad spend and investing instead in brand marketing.

According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, in 2020 the company cut its sales and marketing expenses by 28% and has been investing instead in ‚Äúbroad marketing campaigns and public relations to build its brand.‚Äù

On a call with analysts, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said the company is focusing its ad spend on categories (home style, proximity to popular activities), and on customer and host concerns, like cancellations, booking mix-ups, and insurance.

It sounds new, but it really isn‚Äôt. Building brand and customer loyalty is what venerable companies like Ralph Lauren and Disney have been doing forever.

L.L. Bean, which was once famous for its return policy ‚Äî any product, any time, for any reason, no receipt required ‚Äî last year posted its highest-ever annual revenue of $1.8 billion.

Airbnb‚Äôs Chesky reported that the company still uses performance marketing for specific goals, ‚Äúas more of a way to laser in to balance supply and demand rather than a way to just purchase a large amount of customers.‚Äù

Translation: The company is building a customer base that is more personalized and creates an atmosphere of trust. That is values marketing and it's what our research at First Insight shows the younger generations look for ‚Äî shared values.

The four dozen exchange-traded funds and mutual funds in the Bloomberg database that have the word ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù in their description -- many of them introduced in the past 12 months -- have plunged in the bear market. The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, the biggest of them, has fallen 51% in the past year.

The declines accelerated Thursday after shares of Zuckerberg‚Äôs rechristened Meta Platforms Inc. plunged the most in eight months. The chief executive officer and co-founder asked investors to be patient with the huge investments in the metaverse even as the company reported a slowdown in its main source of income, digital advertising.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to rebrand it, it‚Äôs another thing to say, well, we don‚Äôt see substantial profits from the metaverse‚Äù for years, said Dennis Dick, head of market structure and a proprietary trader at Bright Trading. ‚ÄúInvestors in this market aren‚Äôt going to wait eight years to see substantial profits.‚Äù

The performance of the metaverse funds shows the risk of piling in to an unproven industry regardless of the price you pay: The companies that are seen as the building blocks of the metaverse -- digital worlds where users can socialize, play and do business -- are just the kind of stocks that investors are fleeing right now. Many of them have little or no earnings and sell for high valuations, with the promise of rapid growth and big profits far in the future.

The 18 metaverse funds that have been around for a year or more are down 33% to 66% over the past 12 months. Some of the stocks that are popular with the funds have gotten equally hammered: Meta is down 69%, while games company Roblox Corp. has fallen 42% and graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp. has tumbled 46%.

And fund industry heavyweights are still rolling out products, along with marketing materials to explain the sector. Allianz Global Investors introduced a fund just last week, while Legal & General Group Plc and Invesco Ltd. also have done so over the past few months.

The metaverse is still as much an idea as an actual product for many companies. But the dramatic change in the market environment means that most investors lack the stomach for long-term bets and are looking for firms with steady growth rates and tangible profits.

Even bulls consider metaverse a long-term bet. Matthew Kanterman, the director of research at Ball Metaverse Research Partners, said it‚Äôs still the ‚Äúvery early innings.‚Äù

For Meta, changing its name and ‚Äúgoing all in and investing the amount they are investing in it today‚Äù is a big commitment given that the return might not come around for 10 to 15 years, said Kanterman. That‚Äôs ‚Äúan investment cycle that is pretty much two to three times longer than the average cycle for any new product.‚Äù

A weak forecast by Amazon.com Inc. triggered a 14% selloff in the e-commerce giant‚Äôs stock in premarket trading. Its market value is set to fall below $1 trillion after the company projected the slowest holiday-quarter growth in its history, while sales at its important web services business missed estimates.

‚Ä¢ About 24 million people are planning to fly over the Independence Day holiday, and the flight cancellations have already started.

There‚Äôs a word that keeps sending shivers down dealmakers‚Äô spines: antitrust. The crackdown is coming from many angles. The Department of Justice is signaling greater scrutiny of takeovers. Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission has been gearing up for ‚Äúthe Big One‚Äù in its fight with Amazon.com Inc. And then there are members of Congress who are urging government agencies to crack those whips. The idea that lawmakers are so eagerly stepping in is putting some bankers, chief executive officers and private equity firms on alert.

This year has had one of the worst starts for dealmaking in a decade, with roughly $1 trillion worth of transaction volumes wiped out in 2023 compared with activity for the first half of last year, according to my colleagues at Bloomberg Deals. Trouble from regulators is a big cause. ‚ÄúIt makes the potential buyers that much more cautious before entering into transactions,‚Äù says Frank Aquila of Sullivan & Cromwell, whose law firm is No. 1 on M&A this year, according to Bloomberg data. ‚ÄúIt makes sellers wanting much more contractual certainty that the deal will be completed.‚Äù

The list of transactions facing scrutiny is long:
‚Ä¢ Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs $69 billion planned takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc. is the subject of a five-day hearing in San Francisco over the FTC‚Äôs attempt to block the deal. Activision‚Äôs CEO has warned that a pause on the deal will likely kill it.
‚Ä¢ The PGA Tour‚Äôs merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf faces a hearing on July 11 from a Senate panel investigating the deal.
‚Ä¢ Circor International Inc. is pursuing a sale to KKR & Co., which raised its bid after a Circor rival made a competing offer. That firm, Arcline Investment Management, faced scrutiny from a lawmaker on the House Armed Services Committee over consolidation among defense companies‚Äîand those concerns helped give KKR the upper hand. Circor decided to recommend the private equity bidder at a lower price because the deal had a better chance of approval.
‚Ä¢ Amgen Inc.‚Äôs almost $28 billion deal to buy Horizon Therapeutics Plc, which faces an FTC lawsuit, is a case that threatens the business model of Big Pharma‚Äîwhere big, rich drugmakers have often bought smaller, innovative companies to expand and scale. The lawsuit has also upended merger arbitrage traders, who faced their worst months since early 2020 after the Amgen suit was filed in May and have begun to unwind some positions.
‚Ä¢ Broadcom Inc. is working with the European Commission, which sent the semiconductor giant a ‚Äústatement of objections‚Äù on its $61 billion announced takeover of VMWare Inc.
‚Ä¢ Kroger Co. has vowed a legal fight if its almost $25 billion deal to buy Albertsons Cos. is blocked by regulators.
‚Ä¢ Then, of course, there‚Äôs the Justice Department statement that it plans to expand its review of bank mergers‚Äîbefore more deals have even been announced.

And that‚Äôs not all. There are at least $190 billion worth of deals in ‚Äúzombie M&A purgatory,‚Äù according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence. They calculate more than 2,600 transactions that started in 2022 but haven‚Äôt closed this year, although rising interest rates and choppy markets are also factors.

Investment banks have felt the pressure. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are among investment banking giants cutting jobs across different levels of seniority. It‚Äôs a signal that even amid the light flurry of smaller takeovers announced this week, the M&A activity might not come back soon enough to justify the huge workforces that have built up on Wall Street over the past couple of years.

The competition among banks is ratcheting up. JPMorgan is beating Goldman in the dealmaking league tables for the first half of the year, the first time we‚Äôve seen Goldman slip from the top in five years. One reason for the change, according to industry watchers, is the lack of megadeals out there right now.

All banks undergoing the Federal Reserve stress tests passed this year. In the test scenarios, the banks lost more than $540 billion, mostly tied to potential loan losses that would come from a plunge in the economy. It‚Äôs worth taking note of where the losses would come from, though: Almost $100 billion came from the biggest Wall Street banks when their trading desks were forced to simulate an ‚Äúexploratory market shock‚Äù for the first time ever. Credit card loans and commercial real estate portfolios‚Äîwhich faced a 40% plunge in prices in the Fed‚Äôs scenarios‚Äîalso bore the brunt.

Really, it‚Äôs the regionals that again drew the most concern. It‚Äôs worth‚Äîmore than anything‚Äîreading this story by my colleagues led by Jenny Surane on just how much pressure the regional banking system is set to face after a twelvefold increase in borrowing costs. Part of this is a surge in borrowing from Federal Home Loan Bank and an increased reliance on brokered deposits. It sets up the pain that is being experienced in bank liabilities, just another problem to add in a system that‚Äôs faced a run on deposits, with money slowly (and sometimes very quickly) running away from banks.

And while regional banks stay stressed, private credit firms and hedge funds are seeing those lenders dump loans at scale.

Through it all, I figured megacorp muscle would get it done, but what‚Äôs the biggest threat to a megacorp? A bunch of other megacorps ganging up on it. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening now to Microsoft.

While Microsoft‚Äôs chief antagonist throughout this whole process has been Sony, mostly centered on complaints about Call of Duty and its potential exclusivity (which Microsoft denies will occur), now Google and NVIDIA are joining the fray, ‚Äúvoicing concerns‚Äù to the FTC about the deal. And for once, the complaints are not based on Call of Duty.

The issues they‚Äôre raising are that Microsoft may gain an unfair advantage in the cloud gaming, subscription and mobile spaces through this deal. It‚Äôs a bit of a weird complaint coming from Google, a company that just shuttered its own failed cloud gaming subscription service, Google Stadia, which will go fully offline just five days from now. And that failed spectacularly all on its own, given that this deal has not occurred yet.

NVIDIA, meanwhile, wants to compete with Xbox Cloud Gaming through GeForce Now, which seems to be the main force behind their concern. And yet simultaneously, despite raising this complaint, they also say specifically they‚Äôre not outright opposed to the deal.

To my knowledge, this is also one of the only times that anyone has brought up the mobile aspect of all this, as Microsoft is gaining an absolutely huge mobile arm in the form of King, which makes up the majority of Activision Blizzard‚Äôs MAUs and DAUs and a sizable chunk of its revenue from the maker of Candy Crush and a zillion other games. And yet Microsoft‚Äôs argument here is that they essentially have zero presence in the mobile market at all right now, so this just them getting a foothold.

The FTC very much feels like they are doing whatever they can to tank this acquisition for Microsoft, joining similarly antagonistic EU regulators who have been repeating a lot of Sony‚Äôs talking points. But now, Google and NVIDIA being involved, and raising new issues about the cloud, Game Pass and mobile aspects is just more ammunition, even if they say they‚Äôre not directly opposed to the deal. Sure they‚Äôre not.

Activision Blizzard stock has remained high this past year, up 20%, though it‚Äôs currently $20 below the $95 a share Microsoft agreed to pay for it originally. If this deal did collapse, however, Activision has reiterated how devastating it would be for the company, indicating how much they‚Äôre relying on it going through.

It‚Äôs unclear whether Microsoft will eventually be able to convince regulators of their position here, or what steps they might try to take to bypass any unfavorable outcomes in the future. Microsoft maintains this deal will close this year, but who knows how long that may taken, given the current situation, and I‚Äôd be pretty surprised if this was resolved by the time Blizzard‚Äôs Diablo 4 comes out this June. New drama every day here.

The board said the merger would not reduce competition and would create a new carrier, Canadian Pacific Kansas City. The merger is the first between two major railroads since the 1990s and culminates a yearslong campaign by Canadian Pacific to grow. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, this month asked the transportation board to block the deal outright. The decision came amid mounting concerns with the deal, and the board has a congressional mandate to review rail mergers while taking into account the effect that they would have on transportation for the public and on competition.","Under the merger plan, Canadian Pacific, the sixth-largest freight railroad by revenue operating in the United States, agreed to buy the next-largest carrier, Kansas City Southern.",CSX,Transportation,Rail Transportation,CSX Corporation,2023-03-15T22:26:35.895000+00:00,2023-03-15,2023-03-15T22:26:35.895000+00:00,[{'name': 'Business'}],"‚ÄúOn balance, the merger of these two railroads will benefit the American economy and will be an improvement for all citizens in terms of safety and the environment,‚Äù Martin J. Oberman, the chairman of the five-member board, said at a news conference Wednesday.

In approving the deal, the regulator, the Surface Transportation Board, said the new single-line service would shift about 64,000 truckloads a year to rail from the roads, potentially enhancing safety and reducing carbon emissions, and add more than 800 union jobs in the United States. The Surface Transportation Board said the merger would not reduce competition.

A federal regulator Wednesday approved a Canadian freight railroad‚Äôs plan to buy a US competitor, a $31 billion deal that will make the railroad the first to operate across North America.

Under the merger plan, Canadian Pacific, the sixth-largest freight railroad by revenue operating in the United States, agreed to buy the next-largest carrier, Kansas City Southern. The combined railroad will not overtake the fifth-largest carrier, Canadian National.

The deal is the first merger between two major railroads since the 1990s. It also culminates a yearslong campaign by Canadian Pacific to grow. The company had unsuccessfully pursued mergers with several other large railroads, including Norfolk Southern and CSX, over the past decade.

Canadian Pacific said it could take control of Kansas City Southern as soon as April 14, creating a new carrier, Canadian Pacific Kansas City. The company expects to spend three years combining the railroads. The combined company, based in Calgary, Alberta, will operate about 20,000 miles of track and employ about 20,000 people.

‚ÄúThis decision clearly recognizes the many benefits of this historic combination,‚Äù Keith Creel, the chief executive of Canadian Pacific, said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs the STB found, it will stimulate new competition, create jobs, lead to new investment in our rail network and drive economic growth.‚Äù

The merger is known as an ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù combination because there is little overlap between the companies‚Äô networks, a feature unique among recent railroad mergers, Oberman said.

‚ÄúThere will be no loss of a parallel competitive route by putting these two railroads together,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is a central fact of this decision.‚Äù

While the board approved the merger, it did impose some conditions. The railroads will have to keep open their existing gateways, interchanges where railroads meet, and shippers have the opportunity to move their goods from the trains of one company to another. The board also created a process that will allow shippers to challenge certain rate increases by the new company. And it required Canadian Pacific to provide extra data over a seven-year period so the board could monitor compliance with the conditions it is imposing to approve the merger.

The decision came amid mounting concerns with the deal. In a letter to the Surface Transportation Board in January, the Justice Department said that it had ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù about industry consolidation and asked the regulator to carefully scrutinize the merger. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, this month asked the transportation board to block the deal outright, saying it would reduce competition and could result in higher shipping costs, fewer jobs, and more service disruptions.

‚ÄúThis merger clearly fails the public interest test, and accordingly, I ask STB to uphold the law and deny it,‚Äù she wrote in a letter to the agency.

The board has a congressional mandate to review rail mergers while taking into account the effect that they would have on transportation for the public and on competition, among other factors.

Oberman noted that Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern are the smallest of the large US freight carriers that are known as Class 1 railroads. He also acknowledged criticism that the industry had already become too consolidated in recent decades.

‚ÄúThat consolidation presented the landscape on which we are acting today and we have to act in what is the best interest of the country as a whole when considering such a transaction,‚Äù he said. The merger ‚Äúwill actually provide a stronger competitive landscape,‚Äù he said.

The board‚Äôs decision also took into account the environment and other factors. In a detailed review in January, the board found that the merger would have had little negative effect on safety, air quality, or other concerns. Most environmental effects of the deal ‚Äúwould be negligible, minor and/or temporary,‚Äù although some communities could see heightened air or noise pollution, it stated. Oberman also said Wednesday that the merger may well improve safety by removing transport of hazardous materials from roads to railways.

The safety of railroads has gained new prominence since a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, in early February, spilling hazardous chemicals and prompting officials to allow a controlled burn of some of those substances. On Tuesday, the attorney general of Ohio filed a lawsuit against Norfolk Southern.",US approves $31b merger of two big railroads - The Boston Globe,non-causal,"US, STB, CSX",['US'],[],"['CSX', 'STB', 'US']","['CSX', 'STB', 'US']",-0.00069812854

Isom, who testified in the Justice Department‚Äôs antitrust trial against a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue, used the argument to defend against the federal government‚Äôs allegations of colluding to raise prices and reduce competition in the Northeast.

It‚Äôs a chicken-and-egg argument that airlines have used for more than two decades to justify mergers.

‚ÄúDelta has done a really nice job of running a network airline and, based on my assessment, they actually accomplished their merger with Northwest probably five years, six years prior to ours,‚Äù Isom said. ‚ÄúDelta and Northwest created the largest airline in the world and with their network and with their partnerships, they could offer many, many more origins and destinations that could appeal to customers that were no frills all the way up to the most premium.‚Äù

The Biden administration has attacked consolidation in the airline industry and used the American Airlines-JetBlue Northeast Alliance as its first legal challenge to what the White House says is anti-consumer behavior. The case could have big implications with potential mergers in the future, including the pending marriage between Spirit and JetBlue Airlines.

Justice Department lawyers are arguing against an alliance between the nation‚Äôs first and sixth largest carriers, while those same carriers are arguing that they need partnerships such as these to compete against previous mergers.

Delta merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008. United merged with Continental in 2010 and Dallas-based Southwest acquired AirTran in 2011. American Airlines merged with US Airways in 2013.

The question now is ‚ÄúHow much consolidation is too much?‚Äù The four largest airlines carry two-thirds of all passengers in the U.S, according to Department of Transportation figures.

The case is particularly tricky because it involves coordinating routes and schedules in heavily contested airports such as JFK and LaGuardia in New York and Boston‚Äôs Logan International Airport. On Friday, United Airlines announced that it would suspend service at JFK while it negotiates with the Federal Aviation Administration for more slots there.

American has the third most slots at JFK, behind Delta and JetBlue.

‚ÄúAmerican has a slot portfolio, basically round trips‚Äù that total 105 at JFK and 163 at LaGuardia,‚Äù said Isom, who was president of American Airlines at the time the alliance was created. ‚ÄúAnd while it sounds like a lot of flights, in the scheme of things, it‚Äôs not when you‚Äôre going up against competitors [at JFK] where Delta would have double the number of flights.‚Äù

He said American also has 50% fewer slots at LaGuardia, the New York City airport primarily serving domestic traffic.

‚ÄúIt puts us at a great disadvantage and there‚Äôs really not much that you can do other than utilize what you have there as best as possible,‚Äù Isom said.

Government lawyers focused Monday on a March 29, 2020, email from Isom to American Airlines network scheduling chief Vasu Raja, talking about the possibility of industry-wide reductions in capacity in the ensuing 18 months.

Isom said the email focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was quickly forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights across the industry. American announced its alliance with JetBlue three months later while the industry was still in turmoil.

‚ÄúWe were in the midst of the largest crisis that I‚Äôd ever seen in the airline industry, one that was potentially threatening the viability of American and every day that we waited, we were losing out on tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions,‚Äù Isom said. ‚ÄúOn a given day, we only had $7 billion or $8 billion of cash on hand and projections were such that we could run out of cash and become insolvent in a fairly short period of time.‚Äù",American-JetBlue antitrust trial testing limits of industry consolidation,causal,"JFK, US, CEO","['S', 'CEO', 'JFK', 'U']",[],"['CEO', 'JFK', 'US']","['AAL', 'U', 'S', 'JFK', 'CEO', 'US']",-0.9720631

As rates rose, banks racked up paper losses on the loans and bonds they hold. The banks will keep most of those assets until they mature without marking down their value‚Äîunless they are acquired. When that happens, the buyer would have to absorb those losses, taking a potential hit to its capital position.

Acquirers are also willing to wait to see if some banks‚Äô situations turn more dire, forcing the government to step in. Acquiring a troubled lender in receivership can allow the buyer to share the risks and the costs with regulators.

First Republic, which JPMorgan bought in a fire sale, had also drawn interest from regionals such as PNC Financial Services Group. But the bank wasn‚Äôt sold before it failed, and its collapse freed the government to step in with an agreement to share losses and help finance the purchase.

PacWest Bancorp PACW 3.44%increase; green up pointing triangle explored its options, including a possible sale, in May after its share price tumbled. While it did sell loans and a business, no buyer emerged for the entire company.

Finally, executives and advisers are concerned that not everyone in Washington is ready to embrace consolidation. In a June 27 letter to Yellen and other senior officials, Massachusetts Democrat and longtime Wall Street critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote that they ‚Äúappear to be taking the wrong lessons‚Äù from the recent banking crisis by encouraging more deals.

In a recent speech, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said the Justice Department will modernize how antitrust laws apply to bank deals. Deposit concentration within local markets has long been the government‚Äôs main concern, but that fails to account for the power megabanks have amassed across regions and business lines, he said.

‚ÄúI have deep nostalgia for our banking system as it existed in 1995,‚Äù Kanter said. ‚ÄúLike many of you, I remember the excitement of being handed a free toaster when signing up for a new account.‚Äù

The comments from Yellen provide further evidence that Biden officials are starting to warm up to the idea of bank mergers despite concerns from progressives and the administration‚Äôs own scrutiny of corporate concentration.

The worst banking crisis since 2008, marked by a series of bank failures, plunging stock prices and concern about the business model of regional and mid-size banks, has forced a regulatory rethink. Regulators, of course, prefer corporate mergers where strong banks take over weaker ones over destabilizing bank failures.

‚ÄúConsolidation is inevitable,‚Äù said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. ‚ÄúThe progressive backlash is the Catch-22.‚Äù

Against this backdrop, Yellen met in Washington on Thursday with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser and other board members of the Bank Policy Institute.

The readout provided by the Treasury Department following that meeting noted that Yellen addressed the banking stress, reaffirming the ‚Äústrength and soundness of the US banking system‚Äù and thanking the bankers for ‚Äútheir leadership and support.‚Äù But that readout did not mention discussion of bank mergers.

However, sources tell CNN that bank mergers were discussed during Yellen‚Äôs meeting with bank CEOs.

Yellen echoed remarks from US regulators who have said there may be bank mergers in the current environment, one person familiar with the matter said.

Yellen also expressed confidence that the nation‚Äôs diverse banking system, which includes institutions of many sizes, is on a solid foundation in the wake of recent events, the source said.

The Biden administration has sought to crack down on corporate concentration, with regulators moving to block JetBlue‚Äôs takeover of Spirit, Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard and other major mergers.

Yet earlier this month, regulators allowed JPMorgan Chase, the nation‚Äôs largest bank, to buy most of First Republic, the second-largest bank to fail in US history. That deal, which came after a competitive bidding process and was aimed at stabilizing the system, drew sharp criticism from some progressives.

‚ÄúWhat happened here is because a bank was under-regulated and started to fail, the federal government has helped JPMorgan Chase get even bigger,‚Äù Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN. ‚ÄúIt may look good today while everything‚Äôs flying high, but ultimately if one of those giant banks, JPMorgan Chase, starts to stumble, the American taxpayers are the ones who will be on the line.‚Äù

‚ÄòNobody wants to be a hero‚Äô

During an interview with Reuters this week, Yellen said a certain degree of consolidation in the regional and mid-size banking sector could occur.

‚ÄúThis might be an environment in which we‚Äôre going to see more mergers, and you know, that‚Äôs something I think the regulators will be open to, if it occurs,‚Äù Yellen told Reuters.

Michael Hsu, acting comptroller of the currency, told lawmakers earlier this week that his agency would be willing to quickly consider bank mergers.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is ‚Äúcommitted to being open-mind when considering merger proposals and to acting in a timely manner on applications,‚Äù Hsu told the Senate Banking Committee.

Mills, the Raymond James analyst, said investors have shied away from the regional banking sector due to concerns about potential new regulation, surging deposit costs and the fact that shareholders were wiped out after recent bank failures.

‚ÄúNobody wants to be a hero,‚Äù said Mills. ‚ÄúWith little to no warning, some banks went from some of the better-viewed lenders in the industry to zeros.

The exception, known as the Systematic Risk Exemption (SRE), is a caveat in the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), a law that requires that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) impose the ‚Äúleast cost‚Äù on taxpayers when it uses its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to wind down failed banks.

The law ‚Äî which limits the FDIC's power to guarantee deposits ‚Äî emphasizes that the agency must choose the least costly method, even if doing so inflicts losses on a failed bank's uninsured depositors, creditors, and shareholders. In theory, the statute incentivizes government officials to pay out no more than the act requires.

However, the exception, invoked four times in response to the 2008 financial crisis and pared down under the Dodd-Frank Act, can extend reimbursement to uninsured deposits when the U.S. Treasury Secretary decides that the additional FDIC assistance would lessen ‚Äúserious adverse effects‚Äù to economic conditions or financial stability, otherwise bound to happen under the ‚Äúleast cost‚Äù response. To use that authority, the Secretary must first obtain authorizing votes from two-thirds of the FDIC‚Äôs board and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Board of Governors, plus consult with the president.

In a press briefing Monday, following a weekend filled with concerns over contagion risk, President Biden said taxpayers would be spared the cost of backstopping uninsured deposits, while shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders would not see their losses reimbursed.

‚ÄúNo losses will be borne by the taxpayers,‚Äù the president told reporters. ‚ÄúInstead the money will come from the fees the banks pay into the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).‚Äù

Still, the decision to fully reimburse uninsured depositors has sparked controversy from critics who see the measure as an unfair use of banking law, and ultimately, as a government bailout.

Ken Griffin, founder of behemoth hedge fund, Citadel, reportedly described the decision to The Financial Times as a bailout that evidences a breakdown of American capitalism.

Vanderbilt University Law School professor Morgan Ricks said while ""bailout"" isn't a legal term, reasonable minds can disagree about the administration's interpretation of the law's gray area.

""We have uninsured depositors being made whole. I'd consider that a bailout,"" Ricks said. ""Also people can reasonably say this is not a bailout.""

Morgan noted that this week's measures differ significantly from the controversial backstops that taxpayers were asked to shoulder in the 2008 financial crisis, when FDIC funds alone proved too minimal to cover SREs that the Bush administration authorized to rescue some of the nation's largest banks.

The rescue package then sourced hundreds of billions of dollars from the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to absolve Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wachovia of financial responsibility for failed mortgages and other loans. Unlike stricter requirements in today's banking law that make FDIC funds inaccessible to going concerns, Bank of America and Citigroup were permitted to remain in business, while the SRE paved the way for Citigroup's acquisition of Wachovia.

Nationwide deposit guarantees for regulated banks can be traced back to 1933 when widespread bank closures and resulting deposit losses fueled Congress to create the FDIC. Its stated goal at the time was much the same as it is today: to pay depositors up to the insurance limit in the event the bank fails, sell the bank‚Äôs assets, and settle its debts.

While the DIF ‚Äî the fund that pays out depositor losses ‚Äî is primarily funded through quarterly assessments on insured banks and, to a lesser extent, through interest earned on investments and assets recovered through liquidations, critics say that because the fund is ultimately backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, taxpayers are taking on risk when the government chooses to make uninsured depositors whole. The FDIC is also authorized to tap a federal line of credit if DIF funds fall short.

According to Ricks, taxpayers would be on the hook only if the FDIC became insolvent, which happened following the 1980s savings and loan crisis that cost taxpayers around $125 billion and gave rise to the FDICIA.

One former FDIC director who asked not to be identified told Yahoo Finance that the the risk to taxpayers in insuring Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank customers is remote because the FDIC is nowhere near a need to access the FDIC's line of credit.

For the fourth quarter 2022, the DIF reported a $2.8 billion increase in its balance sheet to $128.2 billion. Assessments for the period totaled $2.1 billion and accounted for the fund‚Äôs largest source of revenue, followed by fund investments that totaled $498 million.

Yet Ricks points out that banks can be expected to pass increased assessments to their customers and shareholders, many of whom are U.S. taxpayers.

""We shouldn't pretend that that is somehow not affecting the American people. It does, indirectly,"" Ricks said. ""It's impossible to say what the ultimate incidence of those costs are, but the costs are real.""

Also up for debate is whether or not the administration's use of the legal exception further exposes taxpayers by setting a new standard for bank deposit insurance.

""This sets a precedent,"" Ricks said. ""And it becomes hard to argue that depositors in large banks are really bearing the risk of bank failure that the law says they are.""

In 2010, a study by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office concluded that the more flexible law in place during the 2008 financial crisis would weaken incentive to manage risk. Several months after the study, Congress revised SRE so that it could be utilized only in the event that the subject bank is shuttered.

In his Monday press briefing explaining that loss coverage would not extend to investors, President Biden said.

‚ÄúThey knowingly took a risk and, when the risk didn‚Äôt pay off, investors lose their money,"" he said. ""That‚Äôs how capitalism works.‚Äù

The report on Monday shows requirements for receiving a loan have become more difficult for commercial and industrial loans. Families will also face challenges and higher costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit and credit cards.

The loan officers anticipate problems to continue into 2024. The survey cites concerns about diminished expectations for economic growth, changes in lending standards, terms and business and household demand for loans, concerns over deposit outflows and reduced risk tolerance.

The SLOOS is a quarterly survey conducted by the Fed that collects data about bank lending practices and credit conditions to gauge a pulse on the economy. The survey is a leading indicator of how bank credit will likely change and offers insights into the economy‚Äôs future direction, which can inform monetary policy decisions.

‚ÄúThere has been an ongoing tightening of lending conditions. And that is part of the process by which monetary policy works,‚Äù United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC. ‚ÄúThe Fed is aware that tightening of credit conditions is something that will tend to slow the economy somewhat. And I believe they are taking this into account in deciding on appropriate policy,‚Äù Yellen added.

With tighter restrictions on business and personal loans, the economy will contract. As businesses are unable to procure funding, they will likely need to streamline costs, which will include conducting layoffs. These actions align with Powell‚Äôs policy to degrade the economy and labor market to beat inflation. The rationale behind the Fed‚Äôs policy is that if more people lose their jobs, they won‚Äôt spend as much money, and inflation will start easing downward.

What The SLOOS Says

The survey covers commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans. Due to economic conditions, banks are expected to tighten standards across all loan categories and see a deterioration in the credit quality of their loan portfolios and customers' collateral values. There will also be a reduction in risk tolerance and concerns about bank funding costs.

Banks are tightening credit terms and seeing a drop in loan demand. The survey shows that 46% of banks tightened credit terms for a key category of business loans for medium and large businesses compared with 44.8% in the prior survey in January. For small firms, conditions were slightly more stringent, with 46.7% of banks saying credit terms were stiffer now versus 43.8% in the last survey.

What Will Happen Next

In a press conference last Wednesday, Powell announced that the Fed would raise interest rates for the 10th consecutive time to a range of 5% to 5.25%. In his quest to dampen the economy to bring down record-high inflation, there will be collateral damage, including job cuts.

When rates rise, it amounts to an additional tax on households and companies. The extra costs deter spending for both consumers and corporations. As companies feel the effects of higher borrowing costs, they tighten their belts, cut costs and lay off workers. This is an intended consequence of Powell‚Äôs anti-inflation quest.

A tweet thread by Nick Gerli, a management consultant focused on real estate and lending, suggests that a significant slowdown in lending in 2023 could lead to layoffs and bankruptcies.

Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, New York Community Bank and PacWest Bancorp are just some banks that have announced layoffs throughout the 2022 and 2023 economic downturn.

The implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, the acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan and UBS‚Äôs takeover of Credit Suisse will cause significant job losses. Other banks will plan to downsize as well as they try to lower costs. The layoffs are coming at a time when many banks are facing tighter profit margins and a more uncertain economic outlook.

Layoffs in the banking industry will significantly impact already-reeling small and regional banks. The share prices of several financial institutions have plunged as fears spread. PacWest, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation and other small and regional banks have been the focus of hedge fund short selling, with allegations that they are in dire financial straits.","Bank Loan Officer Survey Shows That The Economy Will Slow Down, Leading To Layoffs",causal,"UBS, CNBC",['SLOOS'],[],"['CNBC', 'UBS']","['BAC', 'UBS', 'SLOOS', 'CNBC']",0.9934141

Fifteen years removed from the 2008 financial crisis, banking regulation is back on the front burner in Washington.

The topic dominated the questioning of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who was testifying today at a House Financial Services hearing just days after the central bank took a pause in raising interest rates.

At the same time across the Capitol, the Senate Banking Committee approved on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote what would be the biggest piece of banking regulation in years. Among other things, it would enable clawing back up to two years of compensation for top executives of failed banks. It heads to the floor of the Senate and has a good shot at passing.

This renewed interest follows the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank earlier this year and the lapses of oversight that were exposed. As the aftermath of 2008 demonstrated, it‚Äôs a politically potent issue.

Passage of the Senate bill would be a big win for Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, a Democrat facing a tough reelection fight next year in Republican-dominated Ohio, and Tim Scott, the top GOP member who‚Äôs running for his party‚Äôs presidential nomination.

Meanwhile, Republicans on the House panel gave Powell an earful about their concerns that the Fed, in the name of bank safety, will impose much stiffer capital requirements and other rules that could crimp lenders and suck capital out of the economy.

Powell was noncommittal, stressing that the Fed still hadn‚Äôt voted on changes to bank rules, but adding that it was mindful of not harming smaller lenders.

The Democrats questioned whether the Fed had dialed back on oversight before the recent failures.

Bottom line: There are new rules coming ‚Äî from the Fed, from Congress and from the FDIC.

It also introduces a new tension between the CFO office and that of the CIO, as OpEx dollars are far easier to budget than CapEx. So isn't there a way to bring the public cloud's flexible business and operational models to on-prem computing? That's what the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Antonio Neri, asked his team to figure out.

By 2017, all the traditional server OEMs were losing business to the public cloud, which continues today. Antonio recognized the threat to his core business but also acknowledged the value of consumption-based computing. So he commissioned a new initiative that year, HPE Next, chartered with delivering a plan to compete in the new hybrid-cloud world. That team delivered.

It‚Äôs All About That GreenLake

HPE announced its HPE GreenLake Hybrid Cloud solution at HPE‚Äôs annual Discover conference in mid-2018. Antonio stood on stage in Las Vegas and told the world that HPE GreenLake would enable ‚Äúa new consumption experience‚Äù for IT, bringing the operational and financial flexibility promised by the CSPs together with more traditional on-prem resources.

He told us that hybrid cloud is a reality for nearly every IT shop, and it's time for the traditional OEMs to embrace that reality fully. Moreover, Antonio told us that this is Hewlett Packard Enterprise's new future. He‚Äôd just bet the company on a new business model.

I remember clearly the jaded skepticism in the analyst room after the keynote. Few believed the company could pull off such a shift, one that impacted HPE's culture as much as its products. HPE proved the skeptics wrong.

Antonio didn't just promise HPE's customers a new choice for hybrid cloud; he told HPE's investors this was a high-growth, high-margin path to the future. He was right. GreenLake began paying off almost immediately.

By December 2018, HPE had grown GreenLake to 400 customers. In its most recent earnings call, HPE told us that the total annual recurring revenue for GreenLake reached $1B for the first time. The company isn‚Äôt sitting still, harboring strong projections for future growth.

HPE offered more statistics about GreenLake‚Äôs growth at its 2022 investor conference. HPE has grown from 400 customers in 2018 to more than 65,000 today. GreenLake has over 2 million connected devices and has more than an exabyte of data under management. More than 80% of HPE‚Äôs largest customers are using GreenLake.

Antonio said of GreenLake during the most recent HPE earnings call: ‚ÄúThe relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both ARR and our as-a-service total contract value higher. Over the last 2 years, we have more than doubled our as-a-service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter.‚Äù

Delivering IT-as-a-Service requires more than just servers, storage, and networking. It also requires a robust set of software and services. These are necessary to give IT users a seamless experience in procuring, provisioning, and managing the underlying resources. This is a critical element of the GreenLake offering. HPE tells us that two-thirds of GreenLake‚Äôs revenue is software and services.

HPE has filled the gaps in its GreenLake offerings with an aggressive run of strategic acquisitions. Since announcing GreenLake in 2018, HPE has acquired nearly a dozen companies that directly contribute to GreenLake functionality. These include companies such as QuattroLabs, Scytale, CloudPhysics, Zerto, and Axis. This week HPE added to that list with its acquisition of OpsRamp.

HPE this week announced the acquisition of OpsRamp for an undisclosed amount. OpsRamp was founded in 2014 to simplify the management of hybrid IT infrastructure. The OpsRamp solution leverages an industry-leading AIOps approach to monitor multi-cloud infrastructure and manage business-critical services.

OpsRamp helps IT organizations optimize services through automation and integration with ITSM and DevOps tools. These capabilities span multi-vendor computing, networking, storage, cloud resources, containers, virtual machines, and applications.

HPE tells us that it intends to integrate OpsRamp into GreenLake. HPE will leverage OpsRamp‚Äôs hybrid digital operations management solution with GreenLake to reduce the operational complexity of multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments in the public cloud, colocations, and on-premises.

It's hard to remember how forward-thinking HPE GreenLake was when it was announced. HPE was alone among the tier-one OEMs willing to undertake such a dramatic cultural shift to take control of its future. However, the company remains alone in putting a consumption-based subscription model as the cornerstone of its offerings.

The strong positive reaction to HPE GreenLake forced HPE's competitors to follow suit. For example, Dell Technologies announced its Apex consumption-based offering in 2020, while Lenovo unveiled its comparable TruScale offering in 2021. Beyond compute, NetApp and Pure Storage also offer on-prem consumption-based storage offerings.

HPE GreenLake is the benchmark for on-prem consumption-based infrastructure, a segment that is growing daily. Enterprises love the flexible economic and operational models that consumption-based infrastructure enables.

HPE‚Äôs CEO Antonio Neri bet the company‚Äôs future that enterprises would respond to the strategic shift. Enterprises have responded, and GreenLake is now a billion-dollar business. HPE‚Äôs continuing investments, such as this week‚Äôs acquisition of OpsRamp, demonstrate that the company is determined to evolve its offering to meet the growing demands of its customers at a level beyond its most direct competitors. HPE is well-positioned for continued success with GreenLake.

Now industry executives are taking a hard look at the need for physical stores, and it is a big opportunity for investors.

It‚Äôs all about something that the industry calls ‚Äúcustomer acquisition costs,‚Äù according to research last week from Benedict Evans, a noted technology analyst. Store rents are another interchangeable ingredient in CAC stew.

To take advantage of this new wrinkle in retail, investors should consider buying FedEx (FDX). Let me explain.

The blueprint years ago for growing sales was simple: Build storefronts.

Even with the emergence of eCommerce in the early 2000s, retail executives believed brick and mortar stores were vital to the customer experience. When Amazon.com (AMZN) started opening stores in 2015 this view seemed to be validated. The convenience of digital shopping carts was trumped by the satisfaction of the real thing, according to a Forbes contributor.

Amazon.com is now rethinking its physical store strategy. The online giant will close 8 of its cashier-less AmazonGo convenience stores, and plans to shutter all 68 of its bookstores.

Industry executives have moved on from the strategy of opening stores to grow sales.

Storefront rents used to be a separate category for retail chief financial officers. Now rent is being bundled in the same broad CAC category as product placement marketing; digital search advertising; brand marketing; lower prices; better return policies; and free shipping.

Amazon.com built a $38 billion per year advertising business by auctioning search words on its digital storefront. Retailers pay a fee to have their products placed first on the list. This is the online version of the business model used by grocery stores to sell eye level shelf space to brands like Proctor and Gamble (PG) and Colgate (CL).

Marketing is only a piece of the puzzle.

Evans points out that executives are asking harder questions about how customers physically get goods, and what is the best return on capital when there is infinite supply of products and media.

Apple (AAPL) operates a wonderful retail store chain, yet it only generates 10% of annual sales. The stores are not so much about retailing, as they are a marketing tool according to Evans. Bright, crowded Apple stores exist to showcase the greatness of iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers.

On the other end of the spectrum, Shein is breaking all of the rules of product development, and winning. The Wall Street Journal reported last April that the fast-growing Chinese brand was valued at $100 billion, more than the combined market capitalizations of H&M, and Zara, the two largest fast-fashion store chains.

The onlin-only firm generates 5,000-10,000 new consumer products every day. Designs are pre-marketed throughout social and other online channels. Only those orders are manufactured and shipped.

Retailers are learning they can earn outsized returns on investment by bypassing expensive retail space leases and employee costs, in favor of a direct-to-consumer business model. The kicker is building-in lower pricing, better return policies, and free shipping.

FedEx is a global logistics behemoth, operating in 220 countries and territories. This firm is the logical gatekeeper to the coming direct-to-consumer bonanza.

Global eCommerce is expected to grow from $3.3 trillion in 2022, to $5.4 trillion in 2026, according to a report from researchers at Morgan Stanley .

Executives at FedEx have been right-sizing the business following the extraordinary jump in deliveries during the pandemic. The business simply grew too quickly. Those excesses are now being corrected.

Raj Subramaniam, chief executive officer said in March that third quarter earnings reached $3.41 per share, 25% above the prior forecast. Subramaniam credited cost-cutting and improved efficiency for the results. He also announced that FedEx now anticipates full year earnings per share should reach the range of $13.80 to $14.40.

At a price of $220.54, FedEx shares trade at 18.7 forward earnings and only 0.6x sales. These metrics are within the historic multiples and do not reflect the coming direct-to-consumer boom.

Shares should trade back to $305 within 18 months, a gain of 38.6% from current levels.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued in federal court to block Amgen‚Äôs acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, a small, innovative company based in Ireland, on speculative grounds that somehow the deal might someday in the future discourage potential competition.

This is a massive misuse of the FTC‚Äôs authority, and the threat alone chills investments in new research with a dark cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The FTC‚Äôs actions also place a significant drag on economic productivity as U.S.-based corporations fight burdensome, expensive and wasteful regulatory reviews and delays.

The proposed Amgen-Horizon deal, worth nearly $28 billion, is one of the biggest merger deals of the year and is being closely watched.

Amgen announced in December 2022 its proposed merger with Horizon, a biotech company focused on developing medicines to treat patients with rare autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. The FTC waited six months before filing suit in federal court in May calling for an injunction against the deal. It is on the docket to be heard in Chicago on September 11.

On Friday, media reports said the FTC suspended separate internal proceedings to block the deal, a signal that it may be ready to engage in settlement negotiations. Amgen has said all along it will agree to terms to address the FTC‚Äôs complaint. ‚ÄúWe would be pleased if our commitment were honored instead of going through a lengthy court process,‚Äù Amgen said in a statement, as quoted by Reuters.

The FTC doesn‚Äôt even pretend in its suit to show that consumers would be harmed on the grounds that one company is buying up another with a competing product‚Äîusual grounds for blocking a deal.

Instead, it is basing its suit on the speculative threat that Amgen might someday decide to ‚Äúbundle‚Äù Horizon‚Äôs medicines with other Amgen products in future Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PMB) contracts, claiming that would chill future ‚Äúpotential competitors.‚Äù

Amgen says in its response to the FTC lawsuit that it does not have any contracts that bundle a pharmacy benefit product with a medical product today and has committed that it has no intention of bundling these drugs and will not do so in the future.

Horizon‚Äôs two drugs at issue are TEPEZZA, which treats thyroid eye disease, and KRYSTEXXA for chronic refractory gout. Both are designated by the FDA as ‚Äúorphan drugs‚Äù because they treat rare diseases. Patients have few other treatment options, and these drugs can have life-altering benefits to them.

TEPEZZA, for example, can help patients avoid barbaric eye surgeries. Raising awareness among ophthalmologists about the drug would mean many more patients could benefit from this alternative treatment.

KRYSTEXXA is used to manage serious and often debilitating gout that can lead to diabetes and kidney and other organ failure. Both drugs need to be administered by physicians.

Patients and the marketplace benefit when larger companies like biotech giant Amgen buy smaller companies because it means the most promising and innovative medicines can reach more patients more quickly.

The biopharmaceutical industry depends upon a robust innovation ecosystem comprised of smaller companies that undertake robust research initiatives, often leveraging venture capital dollars while larger companies, with broader scale and reach in terms of research and development and reliable manufacturing capability, collaborate with smaller companies and often acquire promising medicines in the early stages of development.

Amgen‚Äôs vast production capability also allows a reliable supply of the drugs for patients with few or no other treatment options. Horizon largely uses a contract manufacturer to make its products, but the primary manufacturing facility was taken over under the Defense Production Act during COVID, interrupting the supply of medicines to patients.

Amgen says in its response to the Chicago court filing that the FTC‚Äôs actions are misguided and unprecedented. ‚ÄúGiven the lack of any material competition between Amgen and Horizon, the Transaction should have been cleared months ago under well-established precedent; and Amgen, Horizon and their patients should already be realizing the Transaction‚Äôs significant benefits.‚Äù No European country has objected to the merger, and only six deep-blue states in the U.S. responded when the FTC encouraged them to join the suit.

The California-based Amgen says the FTC‚Äôs ‚Äúallegations are far too speculative to support a showing of probable or imminent harm to competition.‚Äù

The Wall Street Journal editorialized that ‚Äúthe FTC claims that if a smaller company were to someday gain approval for a competing drug, Amgen might then offer PBMs larger rebates for its other drugs in return for giving Horizon‚Äôs treatments preferred placement on insurer formularies,‚Äù discouraging potential competition. ‚ÄúThe FTC doesn‚Äôt even attempt to show consumer harm.‚Äù

But there will be consumer harm if the FTC succeeds in quashing this deal. Not only will patients with these rare diseases who are desperate for treatments be much less likely to have access to the medicines, but millions of others will never see new, better, often life-saving treatments developed by small, determined companies whose products die on the research table when investor funding dries up.

We have been writing about the enormous harm being done by the price control regime the Biden administration is launching to target the most prescribed drugs for Medicare patients. The FTC is joining the fray with this separate effort that will harm even more immediately the most vulnerable patients who are desperate for treatments and cures.

The House Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Jim Jordan, and the House Oversight Committee, under Chairman James Comer, are conducting oversight hearings of the Federal Trade Commission, questioning Chair Lina Kahn about her agency‚Äôs overreach, mismanagement, and disregard for ethics. Chairman Comer says the FTC is becoming a ‚Äúrogue agency‚Äù that is undermining consumer confidence in its important role to protect the American marketplace.

They are correct. It‚Äôs time for the government to put patients first and stop advancing an ideological agenda that violates the physicians‚Äô creed to ‚ÄúFirst Do No Harm.‚Äù",FTC Attempts To Block Major Biotech Company Merger,non-causal,"PMB, FTC, FDA","['S', 'FTC', 'U']",['FTC'],"['FDA', 'FTC', 'PMB']","['FDA', 'PMB', 'U', 'S', 'FTC', 'AMGN']",0.087537915

There are two types of banks, broadly speaking. First, commercial banks, which primarily serve consumers and businesses by accepting their deposits and extending loans to them. Second, investment banks, which help institutions and governments navigate complex financial transactions such as trading, mergers and acquisitions.

Intuitively, the way they make money is different. Commercial banks reap profits from the difference in interest rates between the loans they make and the deposits they receive, while investment banks earn fees on their dealmaking activity.

Bank of America belongs to the first category; Goldman the second. This explains why their earnings, fundamentally, diverged so much. In today's high interest rate environment, commercial banks tend to earn more since they can charge higher rates for their loans while keeping deposit rates low, whereas investment banks typically see a fall in fees because of reduced financial activity.

Goldman, of course, knows that ‚Äî it's been trying to diversify into commercial bank through Marcus, its retail-focused business. But that endeavor's making losses rather than boosting profits and might face threats of ""cannibalization"" ‚Äî as CEO David Solomon put it ‚Äî from Apple's new savings account, launched in partnership with Goldman itself.

Investors punished Goldman for the bank's lackluster quarterly results and apparently confusing strategy, sending its shares down 1.7% ‚Äî and they dipped a further 0.18% in after-hours trading. Investors were also let down by Johnson & Johnson's sales forecast. The company's shares dropped 2.81%.

Nevertheless, U.S. markets were mostly flat. Investors were probably more worried about interest rates, a problem of the future, than earnings reports, a snapshot of the past. And for good reason: Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he anticipates ""one more move"" on rate hikes, followed by a pause ""for quite some time.""

Higher interest rates for longer means tighter margins, lower profits for companies and a general slowdown in the economy. No wonder markets are still, despite the bevy of earnings reports from big companies.

JP Morgan's acquisition of failed First Republic Bank makes it the most globally systemically important bank (G-SIB) in the U.S. In the Financial Stability Board‚Äôs list of GSIBs, JPMorgan will now be number five, only after the four Chinese G-SIBs.

JPMorgan‚Äôs role in the American financial industry harkens the days of J.P. Morgan rescuing the U.S. government in 1895 and later saving banks in 1913. While JPMorgan‚Äôs acquisition of First Republic may placate markets momentarily, it should bring up important discussions for U.S. legislators, policy makers, and bank regulators. Clearly, the Too Big To Fail problem is now worse than it was in the years running up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

After the California Department of Financial Services and Innovation closed down First Republic Bank this weekend, JPMorgan acquired most of the appointed receiver, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The purchase includes about $173 bn in loans, $30 bn of stocks and bonds at fair value, $92B of deposits ( which includes $25 bn from other big banks), and $28 bn of Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBs). The FDIC is providing loss-share agreements and $50 bn in financing; JP Morgan did not disclose the rate in this morning analyst call. JPMorgan will pay the FDIC $10.6 bn, which means netting about a $2.6 bn after-tax gain.

Risk To Look Out For

Investors and bank regulators should take out a magnifying glass and look carefully at JPMorgan‚Äôs increased operation risk exposures. Operational risk is the potential loss in earnings due to problems with people, process, systems, and external events. JPMorgan will now have to spend time really taking a look at how it will integrate people, technology, and data from First Republic Bank. Given the First Republic failed due to serious mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risks, JPMorgan will have to comb through all of First Republic banks‚Äô policies, processes, and data quality. JPMorgan should use its own internal auditors and compliance officers to conduct serious due diligence of First Republic assets and liability.

Determining JPMorgan‚Äôs added interest rate risk is also important to note. A significant amount of First Republic's loan book consisted of jumbo mortgages. It will be important to monitor how the current higher interest rate environment will impact the mark-to-market on these relatively illiquid assets. JPMorgan will share this loss with the FDIC; the question is how much.

Also, due to JPMorgan's even more enormous size and added complexity, the bank‚Äôs regulators, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are likely to require it to increase its G-SIB capital surcharge to help it sustain unexpected losses. Given JPMorgan‚Äôs significant interconnections to other financial institutions and the American economy, it is more important than ever that it is more capitalized.

Clearly, the Too Big To Fail problem in the U.S. is not only alive and well but is now an even bigger problem for the financial industry and the American government. Some analysts have stated that the First Republic Bank failure is idiosyncratic. Three banks have failed in the U.S. in less than 2 months. This is serious. What may not end up being idiosyncratic is poor risk management amongst regional banks. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Corporation all had weak interest rate risk identification, asset/liability gap measurement problems, & were not required to calculate and report the liquidity coverage ratio, a measurement of a bank‚Äôs liquidity in a stressed environment. Bank regulators will have to step up enforcement against banks when examiners and off-site supervisors uncover problems. The treasure trove of documents released by the Federal Reserve last Friday proves that Silicon Valley Bank had problems going back to 2016! The American people cannot afford bank failures. Those empowered with enforcement authority at state and national bank regulatory entities need to act now before more banks fail.

Of the top 100 defense companies in 2022 in terms of revenue, just over half are based in the U.S., including the top three ‚Äî Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) and Northrop Grumman, according to Defense News analysis. However, supply chain disruptions, inflation and higher cost of employees kept revenues down, while U.S. government defense spending remained relatively flat despite additional budgets supporting Ukraine‚Äôs efforts to resist Russia‚Äôs invasion.

Lockheed Martin topped the list with $63.3 billion in defense-related revenue in 2022, down from $64,458 the year before. RTX made $39.6 billion compared to $41.9 billion in 2022, although it obtains a significantly lower percentage of overall revenue from defense than Lockheed Martin.

Northrop Grumman saw defense revenues increase 3% to $32.4 billion in 2022, stealing Boeing‚Äôs third place spot from 2021. Boeing instead made fifth place after reconstituting its defense wing following a slate of losses, delays and unexpected costs.

A Chinese firm, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, made fourth on the list with $31 billion in defense-related revenue for 2022, rising from sixth place in 2021, the list shows.

Total revenues for U.S. companies in the Top 100 hit $534 billion in 2022, Defense News reported.

Investors have been buying more stocks in the 54 publicly traded U.S.-listed firms in the SPADE Defense Index, according to Defense News analysis. The companies reached a total market capitalization of $1.25 trillion last year, and more than 40% of defense stocks saw share prices increase by double-digit percentages.

One way a company can grow its revenue is by merging with or aquiring another, but in 2022, the U.S. government put a stop to large and small mergers and acquisitions on antitrust grounds, according to Defense News. It again blocked Lockheed Martin‚Äôs attempts to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne; instead, L3Harris Technologies acquired the firm.

In addition, the U.S. defense budget at $842 billion for fiscal year 2022 did not authorize major new programs or surge funds into unexpected ones. These factors kept revenues largely static.

The list did not track defense companies based in India, and Defense News relied primarily on think tanks for information about the profits of China-based companies. Three major Chinese firms did not release their data by posting time. Russian companies did not respond to the outlet‚Äôs inquiries.

The analysis also overlooks defense-related revenues generated by private firms, which have only in recent years become major players in the defense contracting universe, according to Defense News analysis. Private firms are not required to disclose financial indicators, making revenues from weapons and related sales difficult to track.

Contract data suggests that General Atomics ‚Äî which produces the Reaper drone ‚Äî and SpaceX were critical providers for the U.S. Defense Department and other world militaries, according to the outlet.

Wall Street analysts have modeled for same-store sales rising 7.5% in the US and 8.2% globally, but McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski warned that the one-year global same-stores sales has hit a near-term peak in 1Q23.",McDonald's eyes three important changes.,MCD,Food & Beverage,Restaurants,McDonald's Corp,2023-04-27T18:22:49+00:00,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:22:49+00:00,[{'name': 'Finance'}],"McDonald's (MCD) has a host of new initiatives in place to fatten its profits and stock price, one veteran restaurant analyst says.

In a new client note out Thursday, Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer outlined three changes McDonald's is making. ""Small improvements are building up to big results,"" Palmer wrote.

First, an improved grading system for franchisee performance will unlock big results, the analyst said. By having a more engaged franchisee base, Palmer thinks McDonald's stands to produce better profits over time.

The enhanced grading system will essentially weed out lagging franchisees, leaving more financially sound ones.

Second, McDonald's introduction of a ""ready on arrival"" digital ordering system could yield market share gains, according to Palmer's research.

The mobile ordering technology integrates geofencing that can notify restaurants when customers are arriving. The app notifies the restaurant when a mobile order customer is within three minutes of the location, speeding up the food pick-up process.

Palmer believes this will help unclog McDonald's drive-throughs during peak dinner hours and bolster customer perception.

And lastly, Palmer is taking a bullish stance on new cooking techniques for patties. The meat will be cooked in smaller batches and grilled with onions, resulting in hotter, juicier, and more flavorful burgers, Palmer believes. The logic: Better burgers, better sales.

The operational tweaks come as McDonald's stock has packed on the pounds this year.

Shares of the Dow Jones Industrial Average component have gained nearly 12% year to date, spurred on by investors' flight to safety and a series of strong quarters.

The stretch of strong quarters for McDonald's continued into the start of 2023.

McDonald's first quarter same-store sales rose 12.6% both in the US and internationally. Wall Street analysts modeled for same-store sales rising 7.5% in the US and 8.2% globally.

But there are a few red flags to the McDonald's investment story, partially explaining why management is standing up new profit-driving initiatives.

McDonald's said it's seeing ""pressure"" on its key units per transaction measure, it told investors this week on its earnings call. That means the typical cost-conscious McDonald's customer is balking at higher menu prices.

""We are seeing in some places resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset,"" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski warned.

That has Wall Street on high alert for a sales disappointment in the second quarter.

""We do think the one-year global same-store sales has hit a near-term peak in 1Q23, and we expect moderation over the next seven quarters as both year over year pricing and underlying year over year employment gains slow down (but stay positive) in most major markets,"" JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe wrote in a note to clients.

The vast majority of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, which offered services to nearly half of the venture-backed technology and healthcare firms in the United States before its collapse last week, exceeded the $250,000 threshold insured by the FDIC. Regulators scrambled to guarantee all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank such that the remainder of the financial system, in which roughly half of deposits surpass $250,000, would remain safeguarded against bank runs.

Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) questioned Yellen about whether uninsured deposits at community banks in his state ‚Äúregardless of their size‚Äù would likewise be ‚Äúfully insured.‚Äù Yellen replied that a bank ‚Äúonly gets that treatment‚Äù if supermajorities of board members at the FDIC and Federal Reserve, as well as she and President Joe Biden, decide that ‚Äúthe failure to protect uninsured depositors would create systemic risk and significant financial and economic consequences.‚Äù

Community banks typically operate in small geographic areas and focus on the needs of businesses and families in their immediate vicinity.

Lankford noted that such an approach to deposit insurance has already prompted sizable account holders to move their funds into large financial institutions.

‚ÄúWe have seen the mergers of banks over the past decade,‚Äù the lawmaker said. ‚ÄúI am concerned you are about to accelerate that by encouraging anyone who has a large deposit in a community bank to say, ‚ÄòWe are not going to make you whole, but if you go to one of our preferred banks, we will make you whole.‚Äô‚Äù

When Yellen said that her agency and other financial regulators are by no means attempting to push large depositors away from small banks, Lankford responded that the phenomenon is ‚Äúhappening right now‚Äù because ‚Äúyou are fully insured, no matter what the amount is, if you are in a big bank,‚Äù while ‚Äúyou are not fully insured if you are in a community bank.‚Äù

Yellen, originally scheduled to testify on the budget proposal submitted last week by the White House, started her remarks by informing lawmakers that the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC successfully protected all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The assets for account holders at both defunct financial institutions were provided by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is funded by fees on banks.

Lankford also expressed concern that community banks in Oklahoma would be forced to pay an additional special assessment to protect the deposits of the ‚Äúlarge number of Chinese investors‚Äù and ‚Äúcompanies directly connected to the Chinese Communist Party‚Äù who had accounts at Silicon Valley Bank. Yellen confirmed that all uninsured investors ‚Äúwill be made whole in that bank,‚Äù including foreign depositors, since there is no ‚Äúlegal basis to discriminate among uninsured depositors.‚Äù

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) raised similar concerns in a letter to Yellen which noted that Silicon Valley Bank had partnered with Shanghai Pudon Development Bank to finance startups in China. The lawmaker requested information regarding whether Chinese depositors can ‚Äúexpect to receive federal reimbursements from the Deposit Insurance Fund and other federal relief.‚Äù",Janet Yellen Admits Community Banks In Middle America Might Not Be Protected Like Silicon Valley Bank,non-causal,"FDIC, OK, FL","['OK', 'R', 'FDIC']",[],"['FL', 'OK', 'FDIC']","['FL', 'OK', 'FDIC', 'R', 'SBNY']",-0.9984491

The financial shock spurred by the closure of Silicon Valley Bank has pushed down a bevy of bank stocks in recent days as investors considered the risk of contagion. The SPDR S & P Bank ETF (KBE) has lost 25% since the start of this month, while the SPDR S & P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) has fallen even farther with a 29% drop. Banks with higher percentages of deposits that are uninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ‚Äî meaning they are larger than $250,000 per depositor ‚Äî have been under increased scrutiny as customers and investors wonder if they are more prone to a bank run. Silicon Valley Bank had around 95% of it deposits uninsured as of December. (Both Silicon Valley and Signature Bank, which was also taken over, have had all deposits backstopped in a bid from regulators to bolster confidence in the U.S. banking system.) First Republic has lost 89.2% of its share value this month as investors considered whether a pledge of $30 billion from a group of banks was enough to shore up its liquidity given that 68% of its deposits are uninsured, according to JPMorgan data. CNBC reported Monday that JPMorgan has started advising First Republic on strategic alternatives. But Wall Street is expecting some bank stocks to come back as investors look past the broader crisis and find comfort in those with relatively strong fundamentals and customers. To find stocks with fortress-like assets, CNBC Pro screened for stocks that had the lowest portion of uninsured deposits, and at the same time were the most liked by Wall Street, using data from JPMorgan and FactSet. CNBC Pro used JPMorgan's data on banks to find those with more than half of their deposit bases insured with a majority of customers under the $250,000 threshold, by the FDIC. These stocks currently have more than 55% of analysts rating them a buy and consensus price targets calling for an average upside of at least 20%. Here's the five that made the list: Charles Schwab has the lowest share of uninsured deposits of the financial institutions on the list at 19%. It's also one of the most-liked financial names, with nearly two out of every three analysts rating it a buy and the average price target implying the stock could rally nearly 50%. The stock has lost 27.8% since the start of March, helping to drag it down 32.4% since 2023 began. First Citizens BancShares and Goldman Sachs also made the list, with each having 33% of its deposits uninsured. Last year, First Citizens completed its merger with CIT Group. The stock has lost 19.6% so far this month and is down 22.2% this year. Despite the drop, two-thirds of analysts recommend buying the bank's shares. The average analyst expects its shares to rally slightly over 44% from where they closed Wednesday's session. Goldman Sachs, a bank considered too systemically important to fail, hasn't been immune to the selloff with a 10.8% slide this month. The stock has lost 8.7% so far this year. More than half of analysts rate Goldman Sachs a buy. Of the stocks on CNBC Pro's list, it has the smallest gain expected by analysts at 27.4%. Wells Fargo , also a major bank, has lost 20.5% this month, bringing shares into negative territory for the year. As of Wednesday's close, the stock was down 9.9% year to date. With 55.2% of analysts rating it a buy, it's the least favored of the five stocks on the list. But the average analyst's price target implies shares could advance roughly 43% from Wednesday's close. Just under half of Citizens Financial 's deposits are uninsured, meaning it has the largest share of those that passed CNBC Pro's screen. The regional bank has outperformed the regional bank ETF with a month-to-date loss of 25.9%. Shares have slid 20.6% since the start of the year.

Uncertainty about the health of regional banks and rising yields in the money market led to a steady outflow of deposits, bringing banks' balance sheets to their knees.

The primary beneficiaries of this situation are large banks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), as they are trusted more.

CEO Jamie Dimon is aware of this fact and warned, not entirely disinterestedly, at JPM's Investor Day on Monday that further turmoil in the banking sector is to be expected. Although JPM, as a bedrock in U.S. banking history, has seen its fair share of turmoil, Dimon could not reassure investors that even he cannot say what impact the current Fed monetary policy will have:

""We've never had QT before. It just started, okay? And you see huge distortions in the marketplace already. We've never had the Fed in the market like this with that RRP program that Jeremy mentioned ever. They have $2.3 trillion basically lent out to money funds. And I don't know the full effect of that. And obviously, that's a direct deduction from deposits are rolling out it made sense to do.""

The JPM CEO pointed out during his presentation that the acquisition of First Republic Bank (OTC:FRCB) was a fluke for investors. This is because JPM did not acquire all of its businesses, but only the most profitable ones, from which it continues to profit even as interest rates continue to rise.

That's why Dimon was also able to announce at the investor day that net interest income this year will be $84 billion instead of $81 billion.

According to Dimon, the current situation will inevitably lead to banks raising the bar for lending. Especially in the commercial real estate sector, things are looking increasingly bleak. That's because, according to Goldman Sachs) economists, 80 percent of those loans are made by regional banks. That is, from those institutions that have suffered the most from the monetary policy of the Fed and the outflow of capital. As CNN reported, Dimon said:

""You‚Äôre already seeing credit tighten up because the easiest way for a bank to retain capital is not to make the next loan,""

The JPM CEO is convinced that the situation will get worse, because contrary to market expectations that the Fed has reached the upper end of its interest rates, he expects higher interest rates, as he explained:

""I think everyone should be prepared for rates going higher from here. You should be prepared for 6 or 7 percent.""

The southeast Asian nation, which is stepping up development of gas projects such as Masela, and in its deepwater, wants to boost domestic use of the fuel after new discoveries in the Andaman and North Bali-Lombok blocks, Tutuka told Reuters.

""Gas will be very important in substituting energy from oil,"" Tutuka, who is Indonesia's director-general of oil and gas, said on the sidelines of the Gastech conference.

That was a result of a continuous decline in oil production and efforts to cut imports of crude oil and fuels, he added.

Indonesia is considering steps such as replacing diesel with gas in its eastern power plants, using gas-fuelled trucks on routine routes, and in the production of petrochemicals, fertilisers, ammonia and methanol.

For example, state energy giant Pertamina plans a blue ammonia plant in eastern Papua using 90 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of gas from Tangguh, while a methanol project in central Java will use 80 mmscfd of gas, Tutuka said.

Indonesia is also looking to build gas-based industries in the Andaman and in South Sumatra, near future production areas, he said.

In the power sector, the government is expected to maintain a price of $6 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) set for domestic power plants to boost economic growth, he added.

Among its projects, BP's (BP.L) Tangguh Train-3 liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant will be in commercial operation by year-end, he said.

The project, which has been delayed by natural disasters as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, will add nearly 4 million metric tons of capacity each year to the Tangguh facility.

This year Shell (SHEL.L) and Chevron (CVX.N) agreed to sell off their stakes in major Indonesian gas projects, a move expected to quicken development of the associated fields.

Shell agreed to sell its stake in the Masela gas project to Pertamina (PERTM.UL) and Malaysia's national oil and gas company, Petronas (IPO-PETO.KL) .

Eni (ENI.MI) will take over Chevron's (CVX.N) stake and role as operator of the Indonesia Deepwater Development project.

Tutuka told reporters he hoped Eni's acquisition of the Chevron stake would be completed this month or the next.

Japan's Inpex (1605.T) , the operator of the Masela project, plans to incorporate a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility in its development plan, with the revision expected to be completed this year.

To swell its reserves, the government is also offering new exploration blocks, among them the Natuna blocks in the South China Sea, which Tutuka said authorities aim to offer to Chinese investors.

Tutuka told Gastech that Indonesia had 15 CCS and carbon capture, storage and utilisation (CCUS) projects in the pipeline, and hoped to spend less than $10 billion for them.

""CCUS is the means to continue using fossil fuel in the future,"" he said.

To facilitate these projects, the government will reimburse company spending on CCUS projects through a cost recovery scheme, Tutuka said, via a regulation issued this year.

Indonesia is also working on broader regulations for CCS and cross-border carbon trade, he added.

BP Indonesia has the biggest CCS/CCUS project at $2.6 billion, Tutuka said, adding that it is now designing front-end engineering for the project that can store up to 35 million tons of carbon in the first phase.

First carbon injection is expected in 2026, he said.",GASTECH-Indonesia scrambles to boost use of gas in energy transition,non-causal,"UL, IPO, ENI, BP, SHEL, PETO, CVX, CCUS, MI, LNG, CCS, KL","['CVX', 'N', 'L', 'SHEL']",[],"['KL', 'LNG', 'CCS', 'CCUS', 'UL', 'IPO', 'PETO', 'MI', 'ENI', 'CVX', 'BP', 'SHEL']","['KL', 'LNG', 'CCS', 'N', 'UL', 'L', 'IPO', 'PETO', 'MI', 'CVX', 'BP', 'CCUS', 'ENI', 'SHEL']",-0.9999372

The COVID-19 outbreak had a negative impact on the global non-alcoholic RTD beverages market as beverage sales and consumption decreased substantially. The travel and trade restrictions imposed amid the pandemic posed as a challenge for businesses operating in this domain. The imposition of stringent nationwide lockdowns and halt of production activities owing to the imposition of social distancing norms hampered market proliferation further.

Surging Demand for Energy Drinks Among Health-Conscious Populace to Aid Market Augmentation

Consumers are increasingly inclined towards health and fitness activities which is elevating the demand for sports and energy drinks. People consume energy drinks as they help in enhancing performance alertness, and endurance. The increasing consumption of energy drinks is thus driving non-alcoholic RTD beverages market growth.

Moreover, several companies operating in the market are offering low-sugar and low-calorie functional energy drinks which will contribute to market augmentation as well. For example, in January 2023, Prime Hydration, LLC., a company offering drink mixes, sports drinks, and energy drinks, introduced a new energy drink named Prime Energy which contains zero sugar and provides 200mg of caffeine per serving.

On the other hand, non-alcoholic RTD beverages have a very high sugar content and are high calorie in nature which will affect their demand negatively and hinder market proliferation.

Asia Pacific held majority of the non-alcoholic RTD beverages market share in 2022 owing rising population and urbanization, growing economic development, and consumer demand for healthy and hygienic products. The region is further witnessing increasing demand for health and wellness drinks. Consumers in the region are demanding functional beverages and foods, owing to their huge interest in holistic well-being which will further propel market expansion.

North America is anticipated to grow significantly in the upcoming years owing to the growing popularity of carbonated drinks in the region. Alcohol consumption in the region has decreased substantially owing to its short-term and long-term health risks. Moreover, the surging demand for low-calorie and no-sugar carbonated beverages led manufacturers to innovate and create different flavors for zero-calorie drinks to attract more consumers which is further attribute to market augmentation.

Europe market is estimated to grow significantly in the upcoming years stoked by surging demand for plant-based food and beverages in the region due to the rising occurrence of lactose intolerance. Leading players are launching innovative beverage options to cater to the growing consumer demands for plant-based options which will further elevate market augmentation.

Tactical developments such as mergers and acquisitions, product launches, partnerships, and collaborations play an essential role in driving market growth and increasing profit margins. They help companies in strengthening their market position and gaining a competitive edge over other players. For instance, in February 2022, PepsiCo Inc. joined forces with Starbucks, an American global chain of coffeehouses, to enter the energy drinks market by launching RTD drink Baya Energy, a carbonated beverage. The joint venture enabled both companies to expand their RTD product portfolio.

Wall Street expects those tailwinds to continue in the new year. Through 2022, the aerospace and defense sub-industry within the S & P 500 rose 15.5%, while the broader index tumbled 19.4%. These stocks benefited from a rotation into defensive sectors offering stability in an uncertain economy. Rising geopolitical tensions, including the conflict in Ukraine, further fueled interest in the field from both stockholders and the U.S. government. Even with a solid year of gains, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on the sector in 2023, expecting more upside as the U.S. focuses on military spending and geopolitical tensions mount from the likes of Russia and China. ""We expect 2023 will continue to be driven by geopolitical risk perceptions as the most significant growth from recent higher defense spending commitments do not begin to materialize until the 2024-2025 timeframe,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag in a note to clients in December.

Here are some of the best-performing aerospace and defense stocks of 2022 and what the outlook looks like in the new year. In search of 'defense ballast' to own Northrop Grumman was the best performer in the industry in 2022, rallying nearly 41%. Analysts are mixed on the trajectory for the stock in the new year, with just 50% having a buy or overweight rating, and the consensus price target implying a 3.4% upside from Friday's close. JPMorgan downgraded shares to neutral in October, citing the stock's recent outperformance. Morgan Stanley remains bullish, naming it a top stock pick for 2023, with a $626 price target suggesting nearly 15% upside from Friday's close. ""While the company screens expensive vis-√†vis peers, we see few substitutes for NOC's best-of-breed portfolio and continue to view the stock as the defense ballast to own,"" Liwag said. The top-performing defense stock in the fourth quarter was Boeing , with shares up more than 57%. During the quarter, the aircraft maker announced a new contract with United Airlines to purchase at least 100 Dreamliners . Wall Street expects Boeing's tailwinds to continue, with more than 6 out of 10 analysts rating the stock a buy. The consensus price target implies a 4.3% upside for the stock from Friday's close. Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak also wrote in a note to clients in December that shares should benefit from recovering air travel, orders, and normalizing free cash flows. ""Cash flow has inflected to positive, will accelerate over the coming years, and Boeing has taken an equity raise and near-term new aircraft development off the table ‚Äî which will drive rapid delevering,"" he said. Raytheon Technologies rose more than 17% in 2022, and analysts are optimistic about the stock in 2023. A little over half say the stock is a buy with 6.1% upside from Friday's close. The stock currently sits more than 4% off of its all-time high set in April. Cowen named Raytheon its favorite aftermarket pick positioned to benefit from an uptick in defense spending. Goldman Sachs agreed, saying shares trade inexpensively to its peers. ""We see RTX as the best way to gain exposure to the high-quality aerospace aftermarket as well as higher global defense spend without overweighting either,"" Poponak wrote. Another big name is L3Harris Technologies , with shares down about 2.4% in 2022. It rose 0.2% in the fourth quarter and fell 8.3% in December. More than four in ten analysts rate the stock a buy, with the average price target suggesting 26.2% upside. Citi rates it as neutral, noting concerns over the company's near-term growth.

Investment in oil and gas companies listed on the S&P 500 increased by more than 26% this past year, even as the index tumbled by 5% overall.

A sector left for dead during the Covid-19 pandemic ‚Äì when energy demand plummeted, and crude oil prices briefly went negative ‚Äì is experiencing a remarkable turnaround.

A rebound in commodity prices caused by geopolitical long-term supply disruptions and heightened balance sheet discipline has made energy the best-performing sector on the large-cap index of premier U.S. stocks.

Gone are the dire predictions that peak oil demand was reached in 2019, as forecasters like the International Energy Agency now expect consumption to hit a record high this year and to keep growing for the next 15 years and beyond.

U.S. oil and gas companies are queuing up for initial public offerings (IPO) again, the clearest sign yet that the sector, which is sitting on record amounts of cash, is back in favor with Wall Street investors.

Texas-based oil and gas producer TXO Energy Partners in January became the first energy company to go public in more than six months. Another nine energy companies have filed or updated their initial public offering documents during the past 90 days, according to Renaissance Capital.

If they all are listed this year, as expected, it will be the oil and gas sector‚Äôs strongest IPO showing in six years.

The oil and gas industry is also sitting on record amounts of free cash flow ‚Äì the amount of cash a company has after deducting operating expenses and capital expenditures ‚Äì thanks to a greater commitment to capital discipline and higher oil prices, prompting renewed interest in mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

The top 25 North American exploration and production (E&P) firms in the oil and gas sector were sitting on roughly $85 billion last year, according to analyses by McKinsey and Company. The same industry players ended the year with a cash balance estimated at $70 billion to $100 billion.

The sector‚Äôs commitment to cash-flow generation is expected to remain high, reaching between $70 billion and $90 billion this year and between $50 billion and $70 billion annually through 2027. That‚Äôs likely to remain true even if the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price hits $65 a barrel.

A resurgence of M&A transactions is yet another sign of how hot the oil and gas sector is becoming. The rumor mill of possible strategic deals is heating up, most recently with the suggestion that Pioneer Natural Resources could be sizing up Range Resources for acquisition.

The industry is sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars that will drive a new wave of strategic upstream deals as shale companies seek to replenish their inventories of prospective acreage through consolidation now that many have chewed through their best leases after years of breakneck expansion.

Rewarding shareholders with fat dividends remains a top priority for the E&P sector, which is expected to return as much as $40 billion to shareholders through share buybacks in the next year. But with debt levels dramatically reduced and oil prices expected to remain elevated, companies are looking at how to keep the good times rolling for longer. Adding more top acreage to their portfolios through upstream M&A deals makes a lot of sense right now.

Top shale producers want to consolidate their positions in the most prolific basins and leverage their operational advantages to improve efficiency and, ultimately, returns. More cautious players may add assets in adjacent portions of the value chain to expand their reserves.

Most M&A players are keeping a watchful eye on the energy transition and the political debate surrounding U.S. energy policy. They want to use their cash stockpiles to reshape their portfolios to stay ahead of the policy debate, improve their resilience to price volatility, and reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

The oil and gas sector has experienced significant consolidation over the years, with many large companies acquiring smaller competitors. This trend is expected to continue as companies look to streamline operations and reduce costs. Assets with low breakeven costs and even lower emission profiles are in great demand. ‚ÄúLow cost, low carbon‚Äù is the sector‚Äôs new M&A mantra.

The oil and gas sector has had some of the hottest-performing stocks on the market in the past two years. In 2022, oil giant ExxonMobil gained a whopping $195 billion to reach a market cap of $454 billion, while tech goliath Apple shed over $846 billion to end the year with a market cap of $2.1 trillion.

No one suggests that the oil and gas sector will overtake Big Tech. But with interest rates rising, inflation still running high, and investors increasingly looking to ‚Äúincome‚Äù stocks that pay fat dividends over ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù equities, traditional energy stocks look very attractive.",Return Of Mergers And Acquisitions: Oil Sector Dealmaking Heats Up,causal,"IPO, TXO, WTI","['P', 'S', 'U']",['A'],"['TXO', 'IPO', 'WTI']","['U', 'PXD', 'S', 'P', 'IPO', 'TXO', 'A', 'WTI']",8.8885514e-05

Already, some of the market‚Äôs biggest information-technology vendors have promised to expand products and services in the months ahead by integrating capabilities from startup partnerships and acquisitions, including in data management, artificial intelligence and automation, among other areas.

Microsoft Corp. this month said it plans to incorporate AI into all of its enterprise software, while boosting its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the startup behind chatbot ChatGPT. In December, International Business Machines Corp. said it planned to buy Octo, a public-sector IT startup based in Reston, Va. Adobe Inc., a graphic design and video-editing software company, in September agreed to buy collaboration-software startup Figma for roughly $20 billion, its biggest acquisition to date.

‚ÄúThe biggest concern is, will these new capabilities cause us to modify our tools and, more importantly, internal processes,‚Äù said Bill Parks, chief information officer at Infinera Corp. , a telecommunications-equipment maker based in San Jose, Calif.

Mr. Parks said past acquisitions and integrations by Infinera‚Äôs longtime technology providers have at times required the company to quickly adapt to new‚Äîand sometimes unwanted‚Äîcapabilities. That is a potentially costly process that can require overhauling existing enterprise tech stacks, or even hiring high-priced experts to manage new IT tools, analysts said.

Though he declined to name specific IT providers, Mr. Parks said he planned to work with the company‚Äôs enterprise-technology vendors as they expand services through startup acquisitions, ‚Äúto ensure that our concerns are addressed so the relationship can continue to stay strong.‚Äù

Brett Sparks, a senior director analyst at IT research and consulting firm Gartner Inc., said a recently acquired startup‚Äôs existing customers also get nervous when a large owner takes over.

‚ÄúClients fear they may lose familiar talent, incur delays or increased costs, and hit a wall of red tape and bureaucracy,‚Äù Mr. Sparks said.

Apart from higher prices, a common fear among startup customers is that their share of revenue contribution will be significantly diminished, he said. Mr. Sparks gave the example of an IT customer that generates 4% of a startup‚Äôs total revenue. If that customer then accounts for just 0.004% of the startup acquirer‚Äôs revenue, ‚Äúhow concerned will that provider be if my initiative fails?‚Äù he said.

Sameer Dholakia, a partner in the growth investment practice at venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, said a big risk of M&A integrations is the buyer‚Äôs inability to iron out differences in technology, such as programming languages or underlying cloud support.

Mr. Dholakia‚Äîa former chief executive of email startup SendGrid who oversaw its roughly $3 billion acquisition in 2019 by cloud communications firm Twilio Inc. ‚Äîsaid acquirers that ignore these kinds of differences typically end up offering a ‚ÄúFrankenstein-like‚Äù bundle of tech tools, rather than a single, unified solution.

Indeed, some chief information officers continue to question Salesforce Inc.‚Äôs $27.7 billion acquisition of messaging app Slack, roughly two years ago, though they still use Salesforce‚Äôs core customer relationship management tools. This week, activist investor Elliott Management Corp. made a multibillion-dollar investment in Salesforce, according to people familiar with the matter, possibly signaling operational improvements, divestments or other changes, market observers said.

‚ÄúM&A can often make sense on a product strategy whiteboard, but may not work in practice,‚Äù Mr. Dholakia said.

Either way, deals are expected to accelerate this year. After coming to a near standstill at the end of 2022, M&A transactions are likely to pick up as startups begin to field more offers from potential buyers, partly due to lower valuations and unfavorable conditions for public market debuts, analysts said.

Justin Hotard, executive vice president and general manager for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. ‚Äôs high-performance computing and artificial intelligence group, said its strategic acquisitions are aimed at expanding capabilities for its enterprise customers.

Still, he acknowledges that CIOs and other corporate tech leaders have legitimate concerns about the challenges of integrating new technologies into an existing portfolio of enterprise tools.

HPE this month said it acquired Pachyderm, a San Francisco-based software startup, and would integrate the new software tools into its enterprise-tech platform. Terms of the deal weren‚Äôt disclosed.

‚ÄúStartups do one thing well by creating a product to target a particular need and even unlock a market opportunity,‚Äù Mr. Hotard said. As a large technology company, he said, ‚Äúwe deliver solutions that solve several complex problems at once, which is why we need to ensure integrating just a single product from a startup fits in with many others.‚Äù

Mr. Hotard said one way to ensure a successful integration is to be clear about how an incoming startup will fit into an acquirer‚Äôs overall business model‚Äîamong buyers, startups and their customers.

‚ÄúOur existing customer base will want to know they won‚Äôt be forced to replace an existing technology they already buy,‚Äù Mr. Hotard said. ‚ÄúIncoming customers from the acquisition will want to ensure continued functionality from the original technology.‚Äù",Tech Chiefs Fear ‚ÄòFrankenstein‚Äô Software Integrations,causal,"HPE, IT, AI",['IT'],"['IT', 'M', 'A']","['IT', 'HPE', 'AI']","['M', 'IT', 'A', 'HPE', 'AI']",-0.99300116

The only worse result for seething passengers would be to put U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in charge.

Don't laugh. Buttigieg's department said it will investigate Southwest's ""unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays."" It will also ""take action"" to hold the carrier ""accountable,"" as if the airline isn't eager enough to make things right.

Congress is also doing what it does best: Shoot the wounded. Senate Commerce Chair Maria Cantwell announced a probe, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is using the mess to complain as usual about airline consolidation. She wants Buttigieg to block a merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines.

But Democrats care less about stranded passengers than they do about gaining more federal control over the airline industry. Carriers are already required to refund when flights are canceled or ""significantly changed."" Buttigieg proposed a new rule in August that requires airlines to provide refunds if flights are delayed more than three hours, increase the number of connections, land at a different airport, or use a ""downgraded"" type of aircraft. The rule would also force airlines that received federal pandemic aid to provide credits if a passenger says he can't fly because of COVID.

In mid-December, a bipartisan group of 34 state attorneys general wrote Buttigieg demanding that the rule also give state AGs new power to enforce airline consumer-protection laws. The AGs want to force airlines to advertise and sell only flights for which they have ""adequate personnel to fly and support,"" as well as pay ""significant fines"" for delays or cancellations that are ""not weather-related."" But airlines can't control the weather, and sometimes crews fail to show or end up stranded.

Airlines have struggled this year, but government has contributed to the problem. COVID lockdowns cost them business for two years. The federal aid that kept them afloat came with a mandate not to lay off or furlough employees. This caused airlines to offer retirement and buyout packages to preserve cash, leading to a pilot and crew shortage.

Buttigieg's new rule wouldn't reduce turbulence. Some airlines already lure customers with the promise of refunds for delays under three hours. Refund policies are built into ticket prices, allowing passengers to choose their level of protection. Stripping airlines of their ability to compete on refunds and other things won't help customers.

Requiring carriers to add unnecessary employees is inefficient, a sop to unions, and a recipe for higher fares. Imposing fines for non-weather-related delays or cancellations would put new pressure on airlines to cut other corners. The last thing the nation needs is 50 new state airline regulators.

Washington receded from airline management in the 1970s, and the ensuing competition opened air travel to the masses.

The U.S. Surface Transportation Board said the merger will improve the flow of goods ‚Äì from Midwest grain to cars ‚Äì between the U.S. and Mexico.

The Associated Press reports the merger will create 800 new jobs in the U.S.

Regulators said the only major impact of the deal would be more noise and train traffic in places like Chicago, potentially delaying regular commuter traffic on Metra lines.

Soon after, supervisors began calling out problems at the bank, but only internally. None were made public until after the bank's failure on March 10, 2023, and much is still unknown.

Fed Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr has promised full disclosure as part of his supervisory review due out May 1.

Here's what regulators saw -- but the public did not -- in the lead-up to the collapse. The details come from testimony given by regulators to Congress this week.

Examiners issue six citations -- ""matters requiring attention"" (MRA) and ""matters requiring immediate attention"" (MRIA) -- related to the bank's liquidity stress testing, contingency funding, and liquidity risk management.

The citations come just as the Fed has begun to telegraph that it will soon start raising interest rates to fight inflation.

Banks of SVB's size must conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests to assess the bank's resilience to both rising and falling interest rates.

SVB's tests, supervisors find, are not ""stressful enough; they were not realistic... it conducted those tests and the guidance back from the supervisors was that the tests were inadequate,"" Barr told Congress.

SVB's chief risk officer Laura Izurieta steps down. The post remains vacant until December 2022, when Kim Olson takes the job.

Supervisors issue three findings related to ineffective board oversight, risk management weaknesses, and the bank's internal audit function, according to Barr's testimony.

SVB gets its first supervisory ratings as a large bank: a downgrade to a ""3"" on its overall rating and a ""3"" on its management rating.

The scores mean the bank is ""not well-managed,"" Barr said this week.

""The supervisors told the board of directors and the bank that the board oversight with respect to risk management was deficient,"" Barr said this week.

""We are trying to understand how that is consistent"" with the other, lower ratings, Barr said.

A ""3"" rating triggers what industry experts call the ""penalty box"" where the bank is barred from growth by acquisition.

They are not low enough to merit inclusion on the FDIC's confidential ""problem bank"" list.

""We are looking at whether those standards were sufficiently stringent, whether the firm should have been downgraded further, and whether further supervisory steps should have been taken,"" Barr said.

The supervisors meet with the CFO ""to convey the seriousness of the findings directly,"" Barr said.

Supervisors deliver an additional MRA ""based on the inaccuracy of their interest-rate risk modeling"" which was ""not at all aligned with reality,"" Barr said.

""The models suggested they earn more money when they were losing more money,"" he said.

By now the Fed's fight against inflation has lifted short-term rates by 4.5 percentage points since March 2022. Fed supervisors begin a ""horizontal review"" of several banks, including SVB, for interest-rate risk.

Fed staff give a presentation to Barr and other Board members about interest rate risk generally and at Silicon Valley Bank in particular. This is the first time Barr learns of the interest-rate risk at SVB.

""Staff indicated that they were completing their review of the bank and of the broader horizontal review at that time and I was waiting for the results of that review,"" Barr said this week.

Silicon Valley Bank announces it sold ""substantially all"" of its securities that were available for sale and sought to raise more capital in what CEO Greg Becker told shareholders was a strategic action to ""better support earnings in a higher-for-longer rate environment.""

The move was a ""belated"" attempt to improve the bank's liquidity position, Barr said this week, ""and they did it in a way that spooked investors and spooked depositors and spooked the market.""

""The bank was reporting to supervisors Thursday morning that deposits were stable,"" Barr said. ""Thursday afternoon, late afternoon, I became aware of deposit flows, and Thursday evening that there was essentially a bank run.""

Fed staff and the bank work together through the night to move as much SVB collateral as they can to the Fed so that SVB can get emergency loans through the Fed's ""discount window"" to meet demands for withdrawals.

JetBlue has its sights on merging with a smaller and financially ailing airline, Spirit.

JetBlue‚Äôs management believes the synergies between the two airlines will save over $300 million in costs. Spirit's shareholders (i.e., the airline‚Äôs owners) have voted to approve the merger.

Spirit is like a cancer patient in chemotherapy. Industry analysts say that there's a 50-50 chance Spirit will go bankrupt without a suitor. A bankruptcy would crush Spirit shareholders, cause thousands of airline workers to lose their jobs, and enable other bigger airlines to swoop in and purchase its assets and its valuable airport landing rights at fire sale prices.

No one benefits from that scenario.

So, what‚Äôs the holdup here? The Biden Justice Department is holding up the marriage on questionable antitrust grounds.

A strong case could be made that a successful merger between the two smaller airlines will enhance competition and lower prices by creating a larger discount airline. Today, 70% of domestic flights are on four carriers ‚Äî American, Delta, Southwest, and United. JetBlue controls just about 6% of the market (while Spirit‚Äôs has shrunk to about 4%).

A merger like this is hardly going to allow JetBlue to monopolize the market or drive up prices. Regulators are concerned that in certain markets like Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the two airlines directly compete, ticket prices may rise. This ignores that without the merger, Spirit may simply close.

JetBlue is ranked as one of the best airlines for customer satisfaction. To compete more effectively with the big boys, it needs scale.

According to JetBlue‚Äôs merger plans, the airline will leverage the infrastructure, employees, and management of Spirit to schedule 1,700 more flights to 125 cities in 30 countries. This benefits ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt hurt ‚Äî consumers with more choices.

JetBlue‚Äôs market niche has always been to compete in crowded markets by offering discount prices.

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study has found that when JetBlue enters a market, it reduces airline fares by $32 each way on average.

Federal regulators in the Biden administration don‚Äôt seem to understand that mergers and acquisitions are a routine and vital component of an innovative and entrepreneurial economy. Investors are willing to put millions of dollars at risk to launch startups in the hope that they will have an exit option at some point of being bought out by more sizable competitors.

How many people will invest in a startup airline in the future if the feds would prohibit the company from ever being sold? Or prohibit the company from growing by acquiring other assets as it grows?

The birth of the modern age in air travel began some 40 years ago when airline pricing and routing were almost entirely deregulated. Thanks to steadily falling airfares, airline travel, which was once the purview of the rich, has become affordable to middle- and even low-income travelers with fares as low as $100.

The irony of all of this is that if the JetBlue-Spirit marriage is prohibited or killed through interminable delays, the people who will be uncorking the champagne bottles will be the executives at American, Delta and Southwest, and United.

New Delhi plans to reopen the application process for $10 billion in incentives and assistance intended to encourage local chipmaking, people familiar with the matter said. It‚Äôs also keeping the process open-ended, doing away with a previous 45-day requirement for submission, they said, asking not to be named as the discussions aren‚Äôt public. That‚Äôs after an initial effort launched last year only attracted three applicants ‚Äî all of which have made little progress so far.

India is joining countries including the US in trying to boost chip output to reduce reliance on expensive imports and dependence on Taiwan and China. The effort has yet to result in any large global chip player moving base to the South Asian nation, underscoring the major challenge supply chain shifts involve.

To kick-start a domestic chip industry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government originally gave companies just 45 days, beginning Jan. 1, 2022, to apply for fiscal support. The state pledged to fund as much as half the cost of building a chip fabrication plant. But the short window led to just a few applicants including a partnership between Agarwal‚Äôs Vedanta Resources Ltd. and Taiwan‚Äôs Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and a consortium that includes Tower Semiconductor Ltd.

India now plans to allow companies to apply again and is set to accept applications until its budgeted $10 billion in incentives is exhausted, the people said. That means the Vedanta and Tower groups might not be the only ones racing to win federal support for chip plants. India‚Äôs salt-to-software Tata conglomerate has publicly voiced its ambitions to get into chipmaking.

Semiconductor production is an uphill task for metals and mining group Vedanta and its iPhone maker partner Hon Hai ‚Äî neither has significant experience in manufacturing chips. Separately, Vedanta is also reeling under a heavy debt burden, which means Agarwal‚Äôs dream to build a chip plant hinges on government aid. The company is just weeks away from winning an in-principle or preliminary government nod, but ultimately obtaining the state funding requires further difficult steps, the people said.

Any chip project, including Vedanta‚Äôs, will have to make detailed disclosures including whether it has firm, binding agreements with a technology partner for production, as well as financing plans comprising equity and debt arrangements. The applicants also need to disclose the type of semiconductors they‚Äôll make and their target customers. To qualify for the full 50% state support, a company needs to make chips using the relatively sophisticated 28-nanometer or more advanced technology.

In a statement, David Reed, chief executive officer of Vedanta‚Äôs semiconductor business, said the project is ‚Äúon track,‚Äù with the venture breaking ground on a site in the fourth quarter of this year and earning revenue in the first half of 2027. He said partner Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, has secured ‚Äúproduction grade, high volume 40-nanometer technology‚Äù for the venture as well as ‚Äúdevelopment grade 28-nanometer technology,‚Äù without disclosing where the tech is coming from.

‚ÄúFoxconn and Vedanta are following the application process issued by the Indian government with confidence and partnership,‚Äù Reed said. ‚ÄúWe have supplied all relevant information and eagerly wait for the final approval.‚Äù

Vedanta has been in talks with GlobalFoundries Inc. and STMicroelectronics NV to license chip fabrication technology, Bloomberg News reported previously. But Agarwal‚Äôs group is yet to name a tech partner. Also, the government considers Vedanta‚Äôs capital expenditure estimate of $10 billion inflated, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg News, but the company has said it is on par with other similar projects.

Separately, another chipmaking plan ‚Äî a $3 billion investment for a fabrication unit in southern Karnataka state ‚Äî stands stalled as the consortium technology partner Tower Semiconductor awaits guidance from new parent Intel Corp., which is working to complete the acquisition.

Vedanta‚Äôs difficulties underscore how hard it is to set up new semiconductor plants, massive complexes that cost billions to construct and require very specialized expertise to run. Such facilities also rely on a large network of suppliers of everything from chemicals and machinery to electronic components, which hasn‚Äôt fully developed in India.

Meanwhile India‚Äôs consumption of chips is rising as electronics manufacturers are relocating assembly operations to the country to reduce reliance on China.

The report on Monday shows requirements for receiving a loan have become more difficult for commercial and industrial loans. Families will also face challenges and higher costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit and credit cards.

The loan officers anticipate problems to continue into 2024. The survey cites concerns about diminished expectations for economic growth, changes in lending standards, terms and business and household demand for loans, concerns over deposit outflows and reduced risk tolerance.

The SLOOS is a quarterly survey conducted by the Fed that collects data about bank lending practices and credit conditions to gauge a pulse on the economy. The survey is a leading indicator of how bank credit will likely change and offers insights into the economy‚Äôs future direction, which can inform monetary policy decisions.

‚ÄúThere has been an ongoing tightening of lending conditions. And that is part of the process by which monetary policy works,‚Äù United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC. ‚ÄúThe Fed is aware that tightening of credit conditions is something that will tend to slow the economy somewhat. And I believe they are taking this into account in deciding on appropriate policy,‚Äù Yellen added.

With tighter restrictions on business and personal loans, the economy will contract. As businesses are unable to procure funding, they will likely need to streamline costs, which will include conducting layoffs. These actions align with Powell‚Äôs policy to degrade the economy and labor market to beat inflation. The rationale behind the Fed‚Äôs policy is that if more people lose their jobs, they won‚Äôt spend as much money, and inflation will start easing downward.

What The SLOOS Says

The survey covers commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans. Due to economic conditions, banks are expected to tighten standards across all loan categories and see a deterioration in the credit quality of their loan portfolios and customers' collateral values. There will also be a reduction in risk tolerance and concerns about bank funding costs.

Banks are tightening credit terms and seeing a drop in loan demand. The survey shows that 46% of banks tightened credit terms for a key category of business loans for medium and large businesses compared with 44.8% in the prior survey in January. For small firms, conditions were slightly more stringent, with 46.7% of banks saying credit terms were stiffer now versus 43.8% in the last survey.

What Will Happen Next

In a press conference last Wednesday, Powell announced that the Fed would raise interest rates for the 10th consecutive time to a range of 5% to 5.25%. In his quest to dampen the economy to bring down record-high inflation, there will be collateral damage, including job cuts.

When rates rise, it amounts to an additional tax on households and companies. The extra costs deter spending for both consumers and corporations. As companies feel the effects of higher borrowing costs, they tighten their belts, cut costs and lay off workers. This is an intended consequence of Powell‚Äôs anti-inflation quest.

A tweet thread by Nick Gerli, a management consultant focused on real estate and lending, suggests that a significant slowdown in lending in 2023 could lead to layoffs and bankruptcies.

Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, New York Community Bank and PacWest Bancorp are just some banks that have announced layoffs throughout the 2022 and 2023 economic downturn.

The implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, the acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan and UBS‚Äôs takeover of Credit Suisse will cause significant job losses. Other banks will plan to downsize as well as they try to lower costs. The layoffs are coming at a time when many banks are facing tighter profit margins and a more uncertain economic outlook.

Layoffs in the banking industry will significantly impact already-reeling small and regional banks. The share prices of several financial institutions have plunged as fears spread. PacWest, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation and other small and regional banks have been the focus of hedge fund short selling, with allegations that they are in dire financial straits.","Bank Loan Officer Survey Shows That The Economy Will Slow Down, Leading To Layoffs",causal,"UBS, CNBC",['SLOOS'],[],"['CNBC', 'UBS']","['BAC', 'UBS', 'SLOOS', 'CNBC']",0.9934141

In its decision, the board lays out conditions designed to protect competition and mitigate impacts on communities.

‚ÄúThis merger will not increase safety risks in any meaningful way beyond whatever level of risk exists from the current daily moves of trains through the communities served by CP and KCS,‚Äù the decision said.

The combined company, to be called Canadian Pacific Kansas City, would connect the United States, Mexico and Canada and cover more than 20,000 miles of track ‚Äî including 8,600 miles in the United States. The line would stretch from south of the U.S.-Mexico border, through the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, parts of the Northeast and into Canada.

The $31 billion deal was announced in 2021, when Kansas City Southern favored Canadian Pacific‚Äôs bid over the offer of rival Canadian National. The deal closed in December that year, but Kansas City Southern‚Äôs shares were transferred to a trust, and the railroads have been operating independently, pending the STB decision.

Opponents had for months urged the U.S. regulator to reject the deal, citing concerns about job losses, service effects and fewer consumer choices in an industry that has had waves of consolidation. The deal drew increased scrutiny after the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, where the release of vinyl chloride prompted evacuations and a public health scare.

The acquisition combines the sixth- and seventh-largest U.S. railroads. CPKC would remain the nation‚Äôs smallest Class 1 railroad. It is the first major rail merger since 1998, when CSX and Norfolk Southern each took a share of Conrail.

Canadian Pacific officials said it will take three years for the two companies to fully integrate and the benefits of the merger to be realized. During that period the company will make capital investments to support the projected increases in rail traffic from more shipments of grains, automotives, lumber, and energy and chemicals.

The combined rail network will open up new trade opportunities, the STB said, including facilitating the flow of grain from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast and Mexico and the movement of intermodal goods between Texas and Chicago. Traffic from Mexico‚Äôs automotive industry will benefit from a new single rail line into Canada that will connect auto plants with distribution and connect auto part manufacturers with the auto plants. Petroleum gas produced in Canada will more efficiently reach Mexico, where it is used for heating and cooking.

The railroads said that the combined railroad will save time and resources because it will be able to operate trains over long distances without having to switch freight cars to other railroads.

The board said it expects the new single-line service will foster growth of rail traffic and ‚Äúsupport investment in infrastructure, service quality, and safety‚Äù while also adding over 800 new union jobs in the United States.

The board also said the merger will benefit Amtrak and its plans to expand passenger service. Canadian Pacific has agreed to allow Amtrak to add service in some corridors and made a commitment that the merger will not negatively impact Amtrak operations.

The decision could strain the relationship between freight railroads and their tenant commuter operators, as well as communities where train traffic is expected to increase. Some communities will see an increase of about 14 trains per day, according to an analysis by the STB.","Regulators approve merger between Canadian Pacific, Kansas City Southern",non-causal,"CPKC, KCS, STB, CSX, CP",['STB'],[],"['CPKC', 'CSX', 'KCS', 'STB', 'CP']","['CPKC', 'CSX', 'KCS', 'STB', 'CP']",-0.92961645

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly looking for something where the equation would be one-plus-one equals three,‚Äù she said.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said in a recent TV interview his company is open to more deals following the PDC acquisition.

In picking off two smaller companies, Exxon and Chevron revealed some of their strategy to investors who have asked how they plan to grow as they sit on historically large piles of cash in the wake of last year‚Äôs energy price hikes.

Exxon and others have eyed potential deals in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most active U.S. oil field. In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon had held preliminary talks with Pioneer Natural Resources, a giant shale company in West Texas.

Conditions are ripe for a deal frenzy in the oil patch this year. The shale industry has shifted from the rapid growth it pursued for more than a decade to a mature business underpinned by fiscal restraint and hefty shareholder payouts. Drilling for new oil discoveries has fallen out of favor with investors, leaving many companies with few options other than to acquire rivals to extend their runway.

The continued run of profitable quarters has helped Exxon and Chevron improve their balance sheets while increasing dividends and buybacks, potentially giving them more leeway with shareholders to pursue deals. Analysts and investors expect Exxon and Chevron to eventually play a big role in scooping up the dozens of smaller shale companies that constitute the industry.

Both companies‚Äô profits fell modestly from the previous quarter, when Exxon reported $11.4 billion in profits and Chevron posted $6.6 billion. Exxon‚Äôs profit came in below analysts‚Äô expectations of $8.3 billion, according to FactSet. It attributed most of the $3.6 billion decline from the first quarter to lower natural-gas prices and thinner refining margins.

‚ÄúThe work we‚Äôve been doing to improve our underlying profitability is reflected in our second-quarter results, which doubled from what we earned in a comparable industry commodity price environment just five years ago,‚Äù Exxon CEO Darren Woods said.

Prices for crude, natural gas and fuels have fallen since last summer, when the national average for U.S. gasoline hit a historically high mark and fuel-making margins reached the widest levels on record.

Despite falling off their highs, commodity prices have remained elevated and are starting to climb again. U.S. oil prices settled above $80 a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since mid-April. Europe‚Äôs energy crunch has made shipping commodities from U.S. ports more profitable, as well. All of that has bolstered the companies‚Äô bottom line.

Exxon said it had $29.6 billion in cash at the end of the three-month period, compared with its record high of $32.7 billion at the end of March. The company expects a recent series of cost cuts will add up to $9 billion in savings by the end of this year, compared with spending in 2019.

Both companies also showered investors in cash. Exxon spent $8 billion on shareholder distributions via dividends and share buybacks in the quarter; Chevron spent a company record of $7.2 billion.

Emboldened by their strong results, the companies have begun to pursue growth in certain parts of their business, a reversal from pandemic-induced retrenchment.

Dan Ammann, president of Exxon‚Äôs low-carbon solutions business, said in an interview the company would consider accelerating its build-out of the relatively new unit via an acquisition if it found other compelling targets.

Exxon formed the low-carbon unit in 2021 to primarily invest in climate-friendly technologies, such as carbon capture, that it hopes will help curb emissions from the company‚Äôs fossil-fuels business and other industrial operations. It is planning to spend $7 billion through 2027 growing the business alongside $10 billion on curbing its own emissions.

Exxon also recently purchased drilling rights in a lithium-rich part of South Arkansas, seeking to extract the mineral, and has plans to build one of the world‚Äôs largest lithium processing facilities nearby, the Journal reported.

Chevron also created its own venture, known as Chevron New Energies, that aims to invest $10 billion through 2028 in carbon capture, hydrogen, renewable fuels and other technologies.

But investors say the companies‚Äô bigger desire is to buy more assets in the oil patch. Both are focused on the Permian, where both Exxon and Chevron have carved out vast strongholds and aspire to pump about as much oil as comes from the Bakken Shale of North Dakota.

Woods, Exxon‚Äôs CEO, has told investors the company is working on technology that will boost the amount of oil it can wring from a well in the Permian, as it seeks to grow production there to 1 million barrels a day by 2027.

Credit Suisse, formerly the eighth largest investment bank in the world, had identified several ‚Äúmaterial weaknesses‚Äù with respect to risk assessment strategy in a recent annual report.

And the fate of the entire negotiation plan rests with the courts because six drug manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce and the pharmaceutical industry‚Äôs main trade group have lodged separate lawsuits around the country trying to block it.

Still, the Biden administration, Democratic allies in Congress and consumer health-care advocates portrayed this initial list of 10 drugs as a milestone to shore up the financial stability of the Medicare system and ease the burden on its beneficiaries. Medicare is a federal insurance system for people who are at least 65, along with younger adults who have disabilities. When last year‚Äôs law passed, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the negotiations would save the program slightly more than $100 billion during the following decade.

The 10 drugs identified Tuesday represent the first wave of medicines destined for price negotiation, with the roster expanding in future years. For this initial batch, manufacturers have until the start of October to agree to price negotiation with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If they do, the companies will quickly need to disclose an array of data to CMS for each selected drug regarding revenue and what the manufacturer spent to research, develop and produce it.

To be considered for the price negotiation, a drug must have no competition from a less expensive generic competitor, and a biologic ‚Äî a category of drugs made from living organisms ‚Äî must not compete with any cheaper version known as biosimilars. The number of drugs involved will expand slightly during the next two years, with a total of 15 each of the next two years and 20 drugs in following years. This year and next, the drugs are part of Medicare‚Äôs Part D, the program‚Äôs drug insurance created two decades ago. After that, the drugs can come from Part D or from Part B, such as cancer therapies, which are administered by doctors.

Limited though it is, the arrival of Medicare drug price negotiation is a sharp break from Medicare‚Äôs history. When the program was created in the 1960s, it covered drugs that were administered in a doctor‚Äôs office ‚Äî Part B ‚Äî but excluded medications that patients took on their own. Despite efforts over the decades to add outpatient drug benefits, they were woven into larger health-reform proposals that failed, and the broader drug benefits did not become part of the program until a set of Medicare changes adopted by Congress in 2003. To win Republican support, that statute included language that prohibited any role for the government to negotiate medication prices. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act ‚Äî known as IRA ‚Äî rescinded the prohibition.

Since the outpatient drug benefits embedded in the 2003 law began three years later, Medicare beneficiaries have been able to get that coverage by buying a separate drug plan ‚Äî through Part D ‚Äî or as part of managed-care plans, known as Medicare Advantage. Either way, beneficiaries still pay some of the cost of getting the medicines, and the government has not influenced the prices that pharmaceutical companies set.

The push for price negotiation faced intense opposition from pharmaceutical companies, which contend that capping potential earning erodes their ability to invest in further research and development. After a rare loss on Capitol Hill, the industry and its business allies have turned to the courts, with the eight cases that could take years to resolve and could land before the Supreme Court.

‚ÄúThe IRA law is not all gloom and doom for biopharma, since it will reduce seniors‚Äô out-of-pocket‚Äù costs, motivating patients to stay on them longer, according to analysts at Leerink Partners, a health care-focused investment bank. And some drugs designated for negotiation at first might not remain on the list for long, because they are scheduled to lose their patent protection soon after the lower prices take effect, meaning they would have competition and no longer be eligible for the negotiated prices.

Under the law, Medicare beneficiaries pay a limit of $35 a month for insulin. Biden issued an executive order last year directing the Department of Health and Human Services to study new models to lower drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In May, HHS proposed a rule that would give the department and states more leverage to negotiate payment for the most expensive drugs covered by Medicaid.

Finally, if only 14 percent of team members say their organization encourages them to design a new career development plan, it should focus on providing employees with opportunities to network and learn from one another.","Career and skills development isn't dying; it's just frigidly stuck in the past.

And by ""past,"" I mean the Pleistocene epoch.

When I go on about the need to a) implement an internal gig economy across your organization, b) introduce a horizontal ignition skills strategy, and c) evolve from a career ladder mentality to a career mosaic development model, it's because of data points like what has recently been published from the 2023 Workplace Learning Report via LinkedIn Learning.

Review the following graphic from the report:

After surveying 1,579 learning and development (L&D) and human resources (HR) professionals with L&D responsibilities who influence budget decisions, as well as 722 team members across over 20 countries, it's fair to suggest there is a lot of work to do.

Only 15% of workers report that their employer actively encouraged them to seek out new opportunities within the company. This statistic is indicative of a culture that fosters the hoarding of talent, encourages silo-based attitudes, and is led by leaders with tunnel vision. To combat the effects of such a circumstance, a company should thoughtfully consider implementing an internal gig economy platform.

Your organization might consider an internal free-agent marketplace open only to full-time team members. Think Upwork, Fiverr, Guru, or Toptal. It's a system geared not toward external contractors but wholly focused on your internal employees. Team members are allowed to take on temporary roles; doing so does not put them at risk of being demoted or losing their permanent position. Consider it a type of job crafting.

Maybe it's even a certain percentage of their time. Let's say two days per week, or 40 percent of their time, is allocated to a three-month project posted to the system. Think of the benefits the team member receives in terms of new skills, experiences, and networks simply in those three months and 40 percent of their time. Now, extrapolate that win-win benefit across your organization.

As I have written in this space previously, horizontal ignition skills development is thinking about the 'big picture' of your organization's talent ambitions while keeping the individual in mind.

If only 26 percent of employees say their organization challenged them to learn a new skill over the past six months, we are in big trouble. The eye isn't off the ball‚Äîthere is no ball!

Organizations and their top leaders should consider implementing a company-wide strategy to provide employees with a wide range of opportunities to learn and grow, such as special projects, cross-departmental collaboration, brief rotations, job shadowing, and extended sabbaticals.

It's no longer solely about moving up but growing across. Horizontal ignition is‚Äîquite literally‚Äîigniting the skill development of employees horizontally in the organization. Therefore, the approach should focus on critical opportunities for employees to network and learn from one another.

Lastly, should we be shocked if turnover rates skyrocket and engagement levels plummet if only 14 percent of team members say their organization encourages them to design a new career development plan?

People and Culture departments, HR, and L&D, stuck in the mindset of offering career development laddering options have their heads buried in that Pleistocene epoch ice field. While there is nothing wrong with showing employees how to shift and thus develop from a Level 1 skill through Level 7, providing that as the only option of a career development model is antiquated thinking.

The career mosaic method does not limit one's career to upward mobility; it becomes more about experiences, skills, overall talent, and networks. Adobe's Vice President of Corporate Development, Direct Investing, and M&A Integration, Hannah Elsakr, refers to it somewhat differently as a ""leadership mosaic,"" but it achieves a similar result. She said, ""If you tie together a lot of the experiences in your life‚Äîthe setbacks, the mentors, the skills and education‚Äîthat all ties together into what I call my leadership mosaic.""

From a career mosaic perspective, what are you doing to help team members pinpoint and achieve the various experiences that help complement a better overall skills matrix for themselves? For example, should the career focus solely on upward mobility, or might we look at a swathe of experiences that help build out the career mosaic? I think you get where I stand on this one.

If you want engaged people in your organization, in part, you must look at their development in a completely different way going forward. If you want to keep them, well, good luck doing so if your head remains in the ice.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued in federal court to block Amgen‚Äôs acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, a small, innovative company based in Ireland, on speculative grounds that somehow the deal might someday in the future discourage potential competition.

This is a massive misuse of the FTC‚Äôs authority, and the threat alone chills investments in new research with a dark cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The FTC‚Äôs actions also place a significant drag on economic productivity as U.S.-based corporations fight burdensome, expensive and wasteful regulatory reviews and delays.

The proposed Amgen-Horizon deal, worth nearly $28 billion, is one of the biggest merger deals of the year and is being closely watched.

Amgen announced in December 2022 its proposed merger with Horizon, a biotech company focused on developing medicines to treat patients with rare autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. The FTC waited six months before filing suit in federal court in May calling for an injunction against the deal. It is on the docket to be heard in Chicago on September 11.

On Friday, media reports said the FTC suspended separate internal proceedings to block the deal, a signal that it may be ready to engage in settlement negotiations. Amgen has said all along it will agree to terms to address the FTC‚Äôs complaint. ‚ÄúWe would be pleased if our commitment were honored instead of going through a lengthy court process,‚Äù Amgen said in a statement, as quoted by Reuters.

The FTC doesn‚Äôt even pretend in its suit to show that consumers would be harmed on the grounds that one company is buying up another with a competing product‚Äîusual grounds for blocking a deal.

Instead, it is basing its suit on the speculative threat that Amgen might someday decide to ‚Äúbundle‚Äù Horizon‚Äôs medicines with other Amgen products in future Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PMB) contracts, claiming that would chill future ‚Äúpotential competitors.‚Äù

Amgen says in its response to the FTC lawsuit that it does not have any contracts that bundle a pharmacy benefit product with a medical product today and has committed that it has no intention of bundling these drugs and will not do so in the future.

Horizon‚Äôs two drugs at issue are TEPEZZA, which treats thyroid eye disease, and KRYSTEXXA for chronic refractory gout. Both are designated by the FDA as ‚Äúorphan drugs‚Äù because they treat rare diseases. Patients have few other treatment options, and these drugs can have life-altering benefits to them.

TEPEZZA, for example, can help patients avoid barbaric eye surgeries. Raising awareness among ophthalmologists about the drug would mean many more patients could benefit from this alternative treatment.

KRYSTEXXA is used to manage serious and often debilitating gout that can lead to diabetes and kidney and other organ failure. Both drugs need to be administered by physicians.

Patients and the marketplace benefit when larger companies like biotech giant Amgen buy smaller companies because it means the most promising and innovative medicines can reach more patients more quickly.

The biopharmaceutical industry depends upon a robust innovation ecosystem comprised of smaller companies that undertake robust research initiatives, often leveraging venture capital dollars while larger companies, with broader scale and reach in terms of research and development and reliable manufacturing capability, collaborate with smaller companies and often acquire promising medicines in the early stages of development.

Amgen‚Äôs vast production capability also allows a reliable supply of the drugs for patients with few or no other treatment options. Horizon largely uses a contract manufacturer to make its products, but the primary manufacturing facility was taken over under the Defense Production Act during COVID, interrupting the supply of medicines to patients.

Amgen says in its response to the Chicago court filing that the FTC‚Äôs actions are misguided and unprecedented. ‚ÄúGiven the lack of any material competition between Amgen and Horizon, the Transaction should have been cleared months ago under well-established precedent; and Amgen, Horizon and their patients should already be realizing the Transaction‚Äôs significant benefits.‚Äù No European country has objected to the merger, and only six deep-blue states in the U.S. responded when the FTC encouraged them to join the suit.

The California-based Amgen says the FTC‚Äôs ‚Äúallegations are far too speculative to support a showing of probable or imminent harm to competition.‚Äù

The Wall Street Journal editorialized that ‚Äúthe FTC claims that if a smaller company were to someday gain approval for a competing drug, Amgen might then offer PBMs larger rebates for its other drugs in return for giving Horizon‚Äôs treatments preferred placement on insurer formularies,‚Äù discouraging potential competition. ‚ÄúThe FTC doesn‚Äôt even attempt to show consumer harm.‚Äù

But there will be consumer harm if the FTC succeeds in quashing this deal. Not only will patients with these rare diseases who are desperate for treatments be much less likely to have access to the medicines, but millions of others will never see new, better, often life-saving treatments developed by small, determined companies whose products die on the research table when investor funding dries up.

We have been writing about the enormous harm being done by the price control regime the Biden administration is launching to target the most prescribed drugs for Medicare patients. The FTC is joining the fray with this separate effort that will harm even more immediately the most vulnerable patients who are desperate for treatments and cures.

The House Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Jim Jordan, and the House Oversight Committee, under Chairman James Comer, are conducting oversight hearings of the Federal Trade Commission, questioning Chair Lina Kahn about her agency‚Äôs overreach, mismanagement, and disregard for ethics. Chairman Comer says the FTC is becoming a ‚Äúrogue agency‚Äù that is undermining consumer confidence in its important role to protect the American marketplace.

They are correct. It‚Äôs time for the government to put patients first and stop advancing an ideological agenda that violates the physicians‚Äô creed to ‚ÄúFirst Do No Harm.‚Äù",FTC Attempts To Block Major Biotech Company Merger,non-causal,"PMB, FTC, FDA","['S', 'FTC', 'U']",['FTC'],"['FDA', 'FTC', 'PMB']","['FDA', 'PMB', 'U', 'S', 'FTC', 'AMGN']",0.087537915

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other executives are scheduled to brief investors Thursday on the automaker's progress toward scaling up production capacity to deliver 1 million electric vehicles a year in North America by 2025.

Work is underway on new agreements to support higher levels of North American battery production, Sham Kunjur, GM's executive director for EV Raw Materials' Center of Excellence.

""Watch this space,"" Kunjur said. ""You'll start seeing more announcements.""

Securing more domestic capacity for cathode active materials is one priority, he said.

Kunjur said his organization is new within GM, and combines legal teams, merger and acquisition experts and treasury staff to work on joint ventures, equity investments and alliances to secure access to battery and magnet materials or production capacity.

Tesla took an early lead in developing in-house battery production in the United States with its first Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.

Among established North American automakers, GM has moved the fastest to emulate Tesla's strategy of building a battery manufacturing network from lithium extraction to assembly of battery packs and cells. GM's Ultium LLC joint venture with LG Energy Solutions has announced plans for four North American battery plants.

New federal subsidy policies signed into law in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act could turn that domestic battery supply chain into a federally funded boost for GM's bottom line.

The IRA's EV tax credits and subsidies are designed to support domestic EV manufacturing. They could move GM closer to making money on affordably priced electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, which will have a starting price of about $30,000, roughly half the price of a Tesla Model Y.

The Inflation Reduction Act ties up to $3,750 per vehicle of federal tax credits to requirements that EV batteries be manufactured in North America using materials sourced in North America or from allied nations.

How much GM will reap in federal subsidies will depend on how technical rules are written by federal agencies. Analysts expect Tesla will harvest more overall than any rival through 2030.

""We'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in 2 to 3 years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States,"" Barra said during a conference call on Oct. 25.

The vast majority of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, which offered services to nearly half of the venture-backed technology and healthcare firms in the United States before its collapse last week, exceeded the $250,000 threshold insured by the FDIC. Regulators scrambled to guarantee all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank such that the remainder of the financial system, in which roughly half of deposits surpass $250,000, would remain safeguarded against bank runs.

Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) questioned Yellen about whether uninsured deposits at community banks in his state ‚Äúregardless of their size‚Äù would likewise be ‚Äúfully insured.‚Äù Yellen replied that a bank ‚Äúonly gets that treatment‚Äù if supermajorities of board members at the FDIC and Federal Reserve, as well as she and President Joe Biden, decide that ‚Äúthe failure to protect uninsured depositors would create systemic risk and significant financial and economic consequences.‚Äù

Community banks typically operate in small geographic areas and focus on the needs of businesses and families in their immediate vicinity.

Lankford noted that such an approach to deposit insurance has already prompted sizable account holders to move their funds into large financial institutions.

‚ÄúWe have seen the mergers of banks over the past decade,‚Äù the lawmaker said. ‚ÄúI am concerned you are about to accelerate that by encouraging anyone who has a large deposit in a community bank to say, ‚ÄòWe are not going to make you whole, but if you go to one of our preferred banks, we will make you whole.‚Äô‚Äù

When Yellen said that her agency and other financial regulators are by no means attempting to push large depositors away from small banks, Lankford responded that the phenomenon is ‚Äúhappening right now‚Äù because ‚Äúyou are fully insured, no matter what the amount is, if you are in a big bank,‚Äù while ‚Äúyou are not fully insured if you are in a community bank.‚Äù

Yellen, originally scheduled to testify on the budget proposal submitted last week by the White House, started her remarks by informing lawmakers that the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC successfully protected all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The assets for account holders at both defunct financial institutions were provided by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is funded by fees on banks.

Lankford also expressed concern that community banks in Oklahoma would be forced to pay an additional special assessment to protect the deposits of the ‚Äúlarge number of Chinese investors‚Äù and ‚Äúcompanies directly connected to the Chinese Communist Party‚Äù who had accounts at Silicon Valley Bank. Yellen confirmed that all uninsured investors ‚Äúwill be made whole in that bank,‚Äù including foreign depositors, since there is no ‚Äúlegal basis to discriminate among uninsured depositors.‚Äù

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) raised similar concerns in a letter to Yellen which noted that Silicon Valley Bank had partnered with Shanghai Pudon Development Bank to finance startups in China.

If the U.S. defaults on its debt and is unable to pay all its bills this summer, the pain will fall squarely on the defense industry.

National security is by far the largest category of discretionary federal spending, with budgets rising over the past two years to counter China‚Äôs military expansion and tackle the conflict in Ukraine. Discretionary military spending reached three-quarters of a trillion dollars last year, up from $590 billion five years ago.

House Republicans led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy have demanded across-the-board spending cuts in exchange for raising the limit of the government‚Äôs ability to borrow money, known as the debt ceiling. With a June 1 deadline looming, President Biden and Congressional Democrats maintain that the borrowing limit should be raised without preconditions and have called the GOP stance irresponsible.

Neither side has presented a path forward that could win enough support to pass both chambers of Congress. The brinkmanship has driven investors from defense stocks and prompted efforts inside the Pentagon to mitigate any impact from the broader budget morass.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the legal debt ceiling will prevent further government borrowing as soon as June 1. That could temporarily disrupt federal spending, risking revenue streams for businesses not only in the defense industry, but also in the arenas including healthcare and consulting that bill the Treasury for much of their income.

A Goldman Sachs index of stocks that depend heavily on government revenue‚Äîlargely concentrated in those sectors‚Äîhas lagged behind the market overall, gaining less than 4% this year, compared with 7.8% for the broader S&P 500.

Even if Congress and the president temporarily resolve the crisis by suspending the debt ceiling to leave time for further talks, it would eat into the time Congress needs to write and pass a budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. That would raise the likelihood the Defense Department will have to make do with a temporary budget known as a continuing resolution.

The debt-ceiling standoff has already led the House Armed Services Committee to delay its work on next year‚Äôs defense budget.

‚ÄúThe Republican leadership‚Äôs decision to take the debt ceiling increase hostage, to basically play chicken with the full faith and credit of our country, also cannot do anything but jeopardize our national security,‚Äù said Rep. Adam Smith (D., Wash.), the committee‚Äôs ranking member.

A continuing resolution likely would inflate the costs of military programs, delay the launch of new ones and prevent production increases.

‚ÄúMy biggest strategic worry is that we end up with a year-long CR,‚Äù Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said at a conference this week.

The latest Pentagon budget request includes numerous new program starts, including the Collaborative Combat Aircraft system of uncrewed jets. Boeing and Kratos are among companies developing the aircraft.

Concerns that military spending could be cut‚Äîor, at best delayed‚Äîin a debt-ceiling fight have weighed heavily on investor sentiment toward the biggest military contractors. Shares in Lockheed Martin are down this year more than 7%, with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman off 16% and 20%, respectively.

Rob Stallard, a defense analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said the stocks‚Äô performance reflects a ‚Äúwall of worry‚Äù among investors over the broader budget debate.

The U.S. has never missed a debt payment, and similar debt-ceiling standoffs often have been resolved in 11th-hour legislative agreements. But analysts and investors say that the drama in Washington this spring reflects a deeper political impasse that risks crimping military-spending growth in future budget negotiations.

House Republicans have proposed capping discretionary federal spending at 2022 levels and limiting growth to 1% a year for the next decade. Those limits would apply to discretionary military spending, which‚Äîat $751 billion‚Äîmade up about 44% of the government‚Äôs discretionary spending last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While Republicans are seeking a spending freeze, many members have voiced support for a larger increase in the military budget, though it would come at the cost of cuts in other areas.

While defense-company executives have been loath to quantify the impact of a disrupted budget, some have tried to position themselves as more protected than others.

KBR, a company that provides logistical support for the military overseas and for the U.S. space program, thinks services in those areas are so critical that the government can‚Äôt cut back on contracts, Chief Executive Stuart Bradie said.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing in space can‚Äôt be turned off,‚Äù he said.

Spending by the Pentagon and other agencies with national security missions tends to be uneven, with large contract awards skewing spending in any given month. That pattern often leaves them unaligned with the flow of tax revenue into the Treasury, requiring borrowing to close the gap.

The prospect of a disruption in federal spending during the summer months is particularly concerning. Contract awards tend to surge in the run up to the end of the government‚Äôs fiscal-year end on Sept. 30, said executives and analysts.

‚ÄúIf Treasury has to start paying obligations without additional borrowing, June to August is not an ideal period to begin that experiment,‚Äù said Byron Callan at Capital Alpha Partners, which provides policy research.

Meanwhile, concerns that the flow of military contracts could be interrupted might have sped up deals before any potential spending freeze.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some programs that have been in the acquisition process for years, and they‚Äôre starting to get awarded,‚Äù Roger Krone, who recently retired as CEO of Leidos, told analysts at an investor event last week. Leidos, whose government contracts span healthcare, civil aviation and defense, earned nearly 86% of its revenue from federal agencies last year.

What are those inflection points for your business? Drawing on client insights and perspectives, Ashish Khosla, market executive, business banking for Bank of America, and Raj Satsangi, market manager, business banking for Bank of America, have identified a few key moments in time.

While a company is growing, there are several considerations: hiring the right talent, expanding your operations and accessing additional capital.

Talent: When growing your workforce, you‚Äôll want to provide comprehensive benefits to help attract and retain the best talent. This includes traditional offerings such as retirement savings (401(k)) and health savings accounts (HRA, HSA). Forward-looking companies are taking an integrated approach to help support employees‚Äô broader needs, including financial wellness, saving and investing. According to the Bank of America Workplace Benefits Report, 97% of employers feel a sense of responsibility for the financial wellness of their employees.

Leasing: Whether it‚Äôs essential equipment or additional space for offices, warehouses or manufacturing, a business owner must weigh the risks and benefits of purchasing vs. leasing equipment and real estate. Some factors include cash on hand, risk mitigation, strength of balance sheet and tax implications. For example, if technology is changing rapidly in your industry, it may be advantageous to lease equipment and upgrade as needed, instead of buying it outright.

Asset-based loans: Businesses can borrow based on their own financial and physical assets, which can range from accounts receivables and inventory to equipment and real estate. Asset- rich companies that have variations in cash flow but need significant capital to help them operate can access revolving lines of credit or term loans that are secured by the borrower‚Äôs assets.

Maintaining and expanding your business involves ongoing fine-tuning of operations, including automating tasks, strengthening working capital and creating accountability to strengthen operational efficiency.

Payments: Making and accepting payments are a lifeblood for business owners. Nearly eight in ten payment transactions globally are now contactless, and that number is expected to increase. Companies are also using real-time payments, which are initiated and settled nearly instantaneously, 24x7x365. As real-time payment methods are adopted, suppliers and companies will increasingly expect faster, more efficient payments.

Working capital: The pandemic showed us how volatile our systems could be, with supply chain disruptions and labor shortages among other challenges. Even well-capitalized companies are vulnerable to market changes; however, companies can strengthen their working capital to mitigate risk. This includes examining how a company can lower costs, evaluate weeks of float, identify new revenue streams and automate tasks to reduce manual work.

Optimize existing technology: Many companies can optimize their existing technology without making significant technology investments. For example, manual tasks, like accounts payable, can be automated or streamlined.

Mapping your strategy: Whether through international expansion, going public or M&A activity, the decision-making process at a time of expansion represents a critical inflection point for a company. When developing a growth strategy, it is also crucial that business owners determine the target effects on various stakeholders, including employees and partners.

Digital transformation: Digital tools can help support expansion, including systems that provide real-time and other payments across geographies, streamline cross-border compliance and protect businesses from fraud and cybercriminals across global jurisdictions. Digital banking is also helping to accelerate M&A deals, reducing transaction time and costs, and delivering greater value to buyers and sellers.

Proactive and strategic planning in advance of exiting a business will ease the transition whether it‚Äôs passing the company on or divesting entirely.

Succession planning: Good succession planning involves deliberation over what is needed for the long-term success of a business. A comprehensive succession plan should include a roadmap for current and future leaders to assess opportunities and risks, earmark strategic investments, plan for disruption and position the company for sustainable growth.

Exit strategy: Before exiting, business owners should assess whether they have a successor with the right skills and desire to take on their role.

While paring its gain amid Friday‚Äôs surge in the S&P 500, the Cboe Volatility Index of equity-market stress posted its first weekly rise in seven and biggest since the bank troubles emerged in March. A measure of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America rose for four straight days through Thursday, only the second time it‚Äôs done that this year. Turbulence measures in bonds and oil also spiked.

Risk appetites are being tested amid the ongoing spectacle in shares of smaller US lenders. The S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) twice lurched as much as 8% this week following the rescue of First Republic Bank. Moves in bond yields, oil and gold showed traders reconsidering bull cases on the economy even as the Federal Reserve hinted its campaign of rate hikes is over and American businesses kept hiring.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting the type of trading where emotions flip on a dime,‚Äù said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, by phone. ‚ÄúThere is no secret-sauce for saying what turns a seemingly healthy bank one day into a source of concern another, and it might be nothing more than just people worrying about it.‚Äù

The S&P 500 ended the five days down 0.8%, with Friday‚Äôs 1.9% surge paring a drop that stood at 2.6% a day earlier. A basket of highly-shorted stocks tracked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. jumped more than 3% on the final day of the week as bears closed positions.

The yield of the two-year Treasury note swung 50 basis points from its peak Tuesday to a low Thursday, helping to send the MOVE index of bond volatility to its highest in almost a month as traders weighed how banking stresses will influence the Fed‚Äôs policy path. A JPMorgan Chase & Co. gauge of global foreign-exchange volatility bounced off its low for the year to rise for five straight days. Ten-day volatility in oil jumped to the highest level since October as crude sank for a third week.

Traders looking for safety pushed the amount of cash into money-market funds to a record and bid up gold to its highest level in over a year.

Combined, the swings pierced the facade of peace that had been reestablishing itself in markets following the collapse in March of SVB Financial Group and other regional lenders. Investors convinced they‚Äôd seen the worst of inflation and the Fed‚Äôs hammering on the economy had less success processing the prospect that some banks remained vulnerable.

While the rout in shares of regional banks eased Friday, investors were loath to sound the all-clear. Options that bet for and against the KRE spiked near record levels this week. Much of the gains Friday came after a measure of short interest on the ETF hit its highest since mid-March.

‚ÄúThe wild card or caveat is always that banking systems are built or based on the trust of depositors. If that trust or confidence is questioned (potentially due to negative news headlines or sharp declines in share prices), a panic or frenzy can unfold where people start pulling their deposits at otherwise solid banks,‚Äù said Phillip Colmar, global strategist at MRB Partners.

Assessing what bank turmoil might mean for the economy was an especially fraught task in a week of unhinged volatility that also saw two of the industry‚Äôs most important people ‚Äî JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Fed Chair Jerome Powell ‚Äî describing the situation as contained. ‚ÄúEveryone should just take a deep breath,‚Äù Dimon said after completing the First Republic acquisition Monday ‚Äî a deal that ‚Äúkind of draws a line under that period,‚Äù Powell later said.

The role of exogenous forces in the volatility also complicates efforts to get a clean read on the implications. Short positions in regional banks jumped appreciably in the runup to Tuesday‚Äôs plunge and a Goldman Sachs trading note said bearish hedge funds were part of that session‚Äôs initial surge of selling. Lawyers at the Wachtell, Lipton firm urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to impose a 15-day prohibition on short sales to give time for work on restoring confidence.

Still, the size of the moves were harrowing. PacWest Bancorp fell 11%, 28% and 51% and rose 82% in separate sessions, while Western Alliance Bancorp lost nearly one-third of its value on the week. If nothing else the volatility raised pressure on lenders to shore up their own finances lest they been drawn into the cyclone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs said that when a pebble starts to fall, you don‚Äôt know if you have a landslide,‚Äù said Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder of Tiger 21, on Bloomberg TV. ‚ÄúThe banks are concerning not because of the couple that failed, but because the sea change of policies is going to make lending much more difficult,‚Äù he said.

And while the labor market is still showing mostly resilient signs and the inflation rate is still high, a non-functioning regional banking system would put a ‚Äúbrake on growth,‚Äù Sonnenfeldt added.

A factor putting a floor under stocks amid all of the volatility has been a better-than-expected earnings season. First-quarter profits in the S&P 500 are now on track to drop less than 4% from a year ago, compared with projections a month ago for an 8.1% drop, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

The outcome of the lengthy federal review process came weeks after a fiery Norfolk Southern train derailment in Ohio led to evacuations and fears of air and water contamination when toxic chemicals were released and burned.

It was lambasted by Metra, suburban towns and Illinois members of Congress, who disputed train data reviewed by the STB and expressed concerns about the effects of additional trains. Extra freight trains could increase delays for Metra commuter trains and drivers, exacerbate safety issues and pose problems for first responders who find their paths blocked by trains at road crossings, they said.

            Authored by Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist,

Even though short sellers are targeting the stocks of weaker US regional banks, the fed funds market shows that there remains fundamental underlying weakness among some lenders.

Banks use the fed funds market to borrow and lend bank reserves to help with their settlement balances. Larger banks, such as JPMorgan, have more reserves than they want (hence their reluctance to raise deposit rates), but many smaller banks often do not, and must borrow in the fed funds market to obtain them.

We know some stress in the banking sector remains as there are still banks who are paying above the top of Fed‚Äôs range for fed funds, i.e. 5.25%, to borrow reserves. Discount window (DW) usage has fallen, but this has simply been transferred to the new BTFP facility, which has better terms than the DW. It is thus evident some smaller lenders continue to face fundamental problems.



Nonetheless, recent consolidation in the sector through rescues and mergers should have steadied the boat for the sector as a whole. The fact that it has not is because short sellers are trying to pick off what they see as the weakest links among smaller banks. Even lenders whose deposit outflows have stabilized, such as PacWest and Western Alliance, have found their stocks under attack.

Illiquid and underperforming commercial real estate (CRE) loans and large, underwater hold-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios are two of the most obvious risks for smaller banks in the US. That seems to be a pretty good rule of thumb for gauging how a bank‚Äôs stock has performed, and probably one for speculators in choosing who to go after.

The chart below shows a clear relationship between banks‚Äô total of CRE loans and HTM portfolios as a percentage of total assets versus drawdown in their share price from 52-week high. A similar chart showing net income with 52-week share drawdown does not show any relationship.



Banks with greater exposure to CRE + HTM have fared worse, and vice-versa. PB is the most obvious outlier in the above chart, with the bank recently merging with First Bancshares of Texas, explaining why its share price is not lower than the relationship would anticipate.

Paradoxically, a weaker economy might help banks‚Äô plight. Worse than expected jobs data today, for instance, might be enough to precipitate a short squeeze, taking many speculators out. Stranger things have happened.

Short sellers, who borrow shares they expect to fall and hope to repay the loan for less later to pocket the difference, have profited from the banking crisis. They gained $1.2 billion in the first two days of May, analytics firm Ortex said.

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a law firm that has represented large companies, such as Twitter, in mergers and against attacks from hedge funds, on Thursday called on U.S. securities regulators to restrict short sales of financial institutions.

In a letter to clients, Wachtell said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should regulate what it defined as ""coordinated short attacks"" by imposing a 15-trading day prohibition on short sales of financial institutions.

This would allow time for regulators to act and for investors to digest information, Wachtell's co-chairman Edward D. Herlihy and partner Matthew M. Guest wrote in the letter, adding that attacks by short sellers are not related to fundamental performance and put the U.S. economy at ""great risk.""

The law firm did not specify any stocks that had been subject to such attack. Wachtell did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments.

Wachtell's proposal would revive a ban implemented in 2008. During the financial crisis, short selling was temporarily banned in the U.S., although a New York Federal Reserve review later showed the curb did not achieve the intended effect.

The SEC is ""not currently contemplating"" a short-selling ban, an agency official said on Wednesday, as worries over bank soundness hit share prices.

The SEC declined to comment on Thursday when asked if it should impose a short selling ban.

However, U.S. officials at the federal and state level are assessing the possibility of ""market manipulation"" behind big moves in banking share prices in recent days, according to a source familiar with the matter.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler also told Reuters the SEC is focused on identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors, capital formation or markets more broadly.

Reuters reported last month that many hedge funds secured high gains as First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank struggled.

While some market participants criticized the practice, others, like non-profit group Better Markets, have said while some do abuse the system, other short sellers warned markets about the challenges regional banks were facing.

""Short sellers act as a check to stock promotions and promotional management teams,"" said Sahm Adrangi, who runs hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital, adding ""It is a very worthy service we provide to keep financial markets running efficiently.""

Some firms are shrinking their balance sheets to strengthen capital and improve liquidity as heightened interest rates and anticipated tightening of regulatory rules loom over the sector.

At the same time, the Federal Reserve has issued a slew of private warnings to lenders with assets of $100 billion to $250 billion, including Citizens, Bloomberg News reported last week. Those notices have touched on everything from lenders‚Äô capital and liquidity to their technology and compliance.

The changes and increased scrutiny by US regulators are ‚Äúall manageable,‚Äù Van Saun said Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt affect how we‚Äôre running the bank. We have the strength and breadth of talent to apply what they are looking for,‚Äù he said of the tighter regulation.

The regional bank crisis has been partly blamed by some on aggressive interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which forced some lenders to seek new capital to make up for a fall in the value of assets linked to interest rates.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday the after-effect of recent banking sector troubles is expected to take some pressure off the U.S. central bank's interest rake hiking cycle.

Tighter credit conditions meant that ""our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals,"" Powell told a central bank conference in Washington.

But Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund, said he doesn't expect the Fed to start lowering interest rates anytime soon as the U.S. economy is still showing signs of strength and inflation is not abating as quickly as expected.

""People thought that inflation was going to come down faster and that the pressure on these regional banks and those failures were leading to this narrative that the Fed was going to lower interest rates by the end of this year. I don't think that's the case,"" Plumb said.

An agreement on raising the U.S. debt ceiling is still possible if both Republicans and Democrats negotiate in good faith and recognize they won't get everything they want, a White House official said on Friday shortly after an impasse in talks was reported. The debt ceiling dispute has weighed on market sentiment, including for regional bank stocks.

DETROIT ‚Äì Jeep and Chrysler parent company Stellantis is offering buyouts to some of its 13,000 U.S. salaried employees, as the automaker attempts to cut jobs and realign its workforce for electric vehicles and software services.

To be eligible, employees must be at least 55 years old and have been with the company for 10 years or have 30 years of service and have a pension. Employees were notified of the buyout offers Friday. They have until Dec. 5 to make a decision.

A Stellantis spokeswoman declined to say how many domestic salaried employees are eligible for the program, or whether the automaker has a target for how many workers it would like to take the packages.

The automaker, which was formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA in January 2021, offered similar buyouts a year ago to pension-eligible employees. It cited similar reasons for those buyout offers.

Stellantis is at least the second Detroit automaker this year seeking to cut employee headcounts, as the companies spend billions of dollars in electric vehicles and emerging software services.

Ford Motor said in August it was cutting a total of 3,000 salaried and contract jobs, mostly in North America, as the automaker attempts to lower costs as part of restructuring efforts under CEO Jim Farley.

U.S. utility companies are selling off their wind and solar farms to free up money to make record investments in the power grid.

Duke Energy DUK 0.97%increase; green up pointing triangle , American Electric Power AEP 1.13%increase; green up pointing triangle and Consolidated Edison ED 0.93%increase; green up pointing triangle have each announced or finished deals in recent months to sell renewable-energy projects. Each has said it plans to use the billions of dollars in proceeds to modernize the power lines and other infrastructure that supply electricity for their utility businesses.

The moves highlight the mounting stress on the country‚Äôs aging power infrastructure, as well as how rising competition among renewable-energy developers is pushing margins lower.

Utilities are planning their biggest spending increases in decades to replace aging equipment, prepare for a surge in power demand driven by electric-vehicle adoption and strengthen their systems to withstand severe weather patterns linked to climate change. Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group, expects that utilities will invest roughly $159 billion in 2023 and $155 billion in 2024, more than any year since 2000, when the group began tracking spending.

Utility spending is generally low-risk and lucrative because regulators allow the companies to earn set rates of return on investments in power lines, and, in some cases, power plants. That isn‚Äôt the case for spending on unregulated businesses, including portfolios of renewables or conventional power plants that operate in competitive power markets throughout the U.S.

Duke in June announced plans to sell about 3,400 megawatts of wind, solar and battery projects to Brookfield Renewable for $2.8 billion. Brian Savoy, Duke‚Äôs chief financial officer, said the sale would help the company finance its capital-spending plan, which proposes $145 billion in investments over the next decade.

Savoy said the company, which supplies electricity in the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, is working to assess what upgrades are needed to account for more electric vehicles and the prospect of more severe hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding.

‚ÄúOur utility growth plans just continue to expand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of work that needs to be done on the grid.‚Äù

The company is also building some renewable projects under its regulated businesses.

AEP, which supplies power in parts of 11 states in the Midwest and South, earlier this year agreed to sell 1,365 megawatts of renewable-energy projects, mostly wind farms, to a consortium of infrastructure investors. The company said it expects to net $1.2 billion on the sale.

Chief Executive Julie Sloat said AEP plans to invest roughly $40 billion in its utility businesses in the next five years. The sale, she said, will help the company reduce financial risk and manage the extent to which customers have to foot the bill.

‚ÄúHow are we going to fund all of that, and keep rates as low as possible for our customers?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are other companies that are probably better suited to own unregulated assets.‚Äù

The sales come as the competitive renewables sector becomes more challenging to navigate amid rising interest rates and an increase in the number of project developers seeking to supply power at the lowest cost. Supply-chain snarls and inflation have lately made projects more expensive to build.

‚ÄúWhen competition picks up, margins start to erode,‚Äù said Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza. ‚ÄúThe valuations of these businesses have deteriorated over time.‚Äù

Duke recorded nearly $1.5 billion in impairment charges in recent months as it wrote down the value of its renewables portfolio, which it once pegged at $4 billion.

Still, large developers see opportunity, in part because of a suite of tax credits available through the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year.

German energy company RWE this year bought ConEd‚Äôs renewables business for $6.8 billion. The acquisition nearly doubled its U.S. portfolio to more than 8 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery projects, with more than 24 gigawatts in the development pipeline. ConEd serves New York City, other parts of New York state and areas of New Jersey.

Mark Noyes, chief executive of RWE Clean Energy, said the company expects strong and consistent market conditions for the next 10 to 13 years because of the Inflation Reduction Act.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing the opposite of utilities. We‚Äôre growing,‚Äù he said, adding that if utilities were to keep the unregulated renewables portfolios, it would require them to spend increasing amounts of capital outside of their core business.

Jehangir Vevaina, managing partner in Brookfield‚Äôs renewable power and transition group, said developers are better positioned for that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right in our wheelhouse,‚Äù he said, adding that Brookfield can retrofit and update existing plants, add battery storage to some projects and ‚Äúoptimize them on a commercial basis, but then also develop the assets in the pipeline and bring them to fruition,‚Äù he said.

Brookfield sees growing interest from commercial and industrial customers willing to sign power-purchase contracts that support the development of renewables. Many companies have set ambitious carbon-reduction targets that depend in part on buying clean power.

Vevaina said the companies are willing to pay more to account for the recent increase in development costs. The Duke deal, Brookfield‚Äôs latest in the U.S., included about 6 gigawatts of operating assets and slightly more than that of projects in development.

‚ÄúThese companies are trying to hit their net-zero targets,‚Äù Vevaina said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs strong demand for good projects in the right locations.‚Äù

The comments from Yellen provide further evidence that Biden officials are starting to warm up to the idea of bank mergers despite concerns from progressives and the administration‚Äôs own scrutiny of corporate concentration.

The worst banking crisis since 2008, marked by a series of bank failures, plunging stock prices and concern about the business model of regional and mid-size banks, has forced a regulatory rethink. Regulators, of course, prefer corporate mergers where strong banks take over weaker ones over destabilizing bank failures.

‚ÄúConsolidation is inevitable,‚Äù said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. ‚ÄúThe progressive backlash is the Catch-22.‚Äù

Against this backdrop, Yellen met in Washington on Thursday with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser and other board members of the Bank Policy Institute.

The readout provided by the Treasury Department following that meeting noted that Yellen addressed the banking stress, reaffirming the ‚Äústrength and soundness of the US banking system‚Äù and thanking the bankers for ‚Äútheir leadership and support.‚Äù But that readout did not mention discussion of bank mergers.

However, sources tell CNN that bank mergers were discussed during Yellen‚Äôs meeting with bank CEOs.

Yellen echoed remarks from US regulators who have said there may be bank mergers in the current environment, one person familiar with the matter said.

Yellen also expressed confidence that the nation‚Äôs diverse banking system, which includes institutions of many sizes, is on a solid foundation in the wake of recent events, the source said.

The Biden administration has sought to crack down on corporate concentration, with regulators moving to block JetBlue‚Äôs takeover of Spirit, Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard and other major mergers.

Yet earlier this month, regulators allowed JPMorgan Chase, the nation‚Äôs largest bank, to buy most of First Republic, the second-largest bank to fail in US history. That deal, which came after a competitive bidding process and was aimed at stabilizing the system, drew sharp criticism from some progressives.

‚ÄúWhat happened here is because a bank was under-regulated and started to fail, the federal government has helped JPMorgan Chase get even bigger,‚Äù Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN. ‚ÄúIt may look good today while everything‚Äôs flying high, but ultimately if one of those giant banks, JPMorgan Chase, starts to stumble, the American taxpayers are the ones who will be on the line.‚Äù

‚ÄòNobody wants to be a hero‚Äô

During an interview with Reuters this week, Yellen said a certain degree of consolidation in the regional and mid-size banking sector could occur.

‚ÄúThis might be an environment in which we‚Äôre going to see more mergers, and you know, that‚Äôs something I think the regulators will be open to, if it occurs,‚Äù Yellen told Reuters.

Michael Hsu, acting comptroller of the currency, told lawmakers earlier this week that his agency would be willing to quickly consider bank mergers.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is ‚Äúcommitted to being open-mind when considering merger proposals and to acting in a timely manner on applications,‚Äù Hsu told the Senate Banking Committee.

Mills, the Raymond James analyst, said investors have shied away from the regional banking sector due to concerns about potential new regulation, surging deposit costs and the fact that shareholders were wiped out after recent bank failures.

‚ÄúNobody wants to be a hero,‚Äù said Mills. ‚ÄúWith little to no warning, some banks went from some of the better-viewed lenders in the industry to zeros.

Each day, employees gather in virtual and in-person ‚Äúworkshops‚Äù to map out the risks that come with big moves such as foreclosing on a home and small moves like allowing a customer-service representative to override a late fee. How best to manage those risks is debated. Employees regularly present before a panel of superiors, and their work either is waved through or sent back.

Risk exercises are common at many companies, but the stakes are higher at

. The bank needs to upgrade its risk and control functions to its own liking‚Äîand to satisfy regulators.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Wells Fargo‚Äôs primary regulator, in January raised the possibility of breaking up banks that can‚Äôt put adequate controls in place. It didn‚Äôt mention Wells Fargo specifically, but the bank was widely seen as a focus of the remarks.

The bank‚Äôs stock is down about 15% since the scandal erupted in September 2016, while

‚Äôs has more than doubled. Wells Fargo hasn‚Äôt been able to shake a 2018 order from the Federal Reserve that handcuffed its ability to grow. And the bank, once a prolific buyer of other banks, has been cutting staff and shrinking business lines

For many inside Wells Fargo, it feels like a make-or-break moment.

Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf spoke at a conference in May about what he perceived to be regulators‚Äô increased willingness to take drastic action when banks aren‚Äôt meeting their expectations. ‚ÄúUntil our work is done, we‚Äôre still at risk,‚Äù he said.

The bank‚Äôs risk exercises are expected to last for at least another year, according to people familiar with the matter.

In these workshops, technically called ‚Äúrisk control self assessment,‚Äù employees document how a banking service works, the risks, the controls that mitigate those risks and any gaps that need to be filled with new controls. In a bank, controls do such things as alerting a bank teller to ask for identification before cashing a check.

The work sometimes has setbacks. Last year, the control work for check and cash processing at the bank‚Äôs back-end operations centers returned to the drawing board because there was no control in place for employee fraud, according to people familiar with the matter.

Banking today looks less like a collection of corner branches than webs of digital systems that move money around the globe. Many banks rely on aging technology accumulated through decades of acquisitions. The challenge is to rework these complex webs while also juggling heavy regulatory scrutiny and avoiding business disruptions.

‚ÄúIt takes a long time to turn a big ship,‚Äù said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays. ‚ÄúAnd Wells Fargo is certainly one of the biggest.‚Äù

The task is all the more challenging for Wells Fargo, which, once the scandal broke, was criticized for having a culture that was both insular and decentralized.

‚ÄúIf you can change a culture in seven years, you‚Äôve done a good job,‚Äù said Thomas Hoenig, former president of the Kansas City Fed and former vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., who hasn‚Äôt directly supervised Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt have major progress after seven years, you‚Äôre probably not doing it right.‚Äù

Scharf said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that the bank needs to meet regulators‚Äô expectations for risk and controls with the speed and quality they expect. ‚ÄúThis will remain our top priority,‚Äù he wrote.

The urgency to right the ship, and the strain that effort entails, is felt across the bank‚Äôs sprawling workforce, current and former employees said. A manager wrote in January to his team that works on internal controls, ‚ÄúEach of us is under tremendous stress, whether we acknowledge it or not, and that stress builds over time.‚Äù

Some workers doing the risk exercises have had to tell their families that they might be scarcely seen for a while. Others had to cancel family vacations to meet deadlines.

Scott Powell, Wells Fargo‚Äôs chief operating officer, said the bank appreciates the hard work employees are putting into this effort. The bank has support systems in place for employees in the control-evaluation process. In general, there is nothing unique about the timelines, he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always talking about how we can make our programs better, and we regularly make enhancements,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf we thought for a second we were creating a process that wasn‚Äôt achievable, we would modify it.‚Äù

Years before the fake-accounts scandal, Wells Fargo enjoyed a reputation as a well-run, low-risk place.

Underneath, though, executives pressed an aggressive sales culture. Branch employees sometimes opened customer accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information just to meet sales goals.

In September 2016, federal and local authorities slapped the bank with $185 million in fines for the fake accounts. Soon, problems were coming to light in nearly every corner of the bank, from financial advisory to auto loans.

Regulators concluded that Wells Fargo couldn‚Äôt manage its own risk. In 2018, the Fed took the unprecedented move of capping Wells Fargo‚Äôs growth.

Scharf joined the following year, the third chief executive since the scandal erupted. He tossed out the bank‚Äôs previous overhaul efforts and drew up a new plan to rework internal controls.

Scharf has said that when he took the job, he expected the bank to be further along than it actually was. In the four years since he joined, things have taken longer than many expected.

The work has outlasted even the control management chief hired in 2020, who stepped down in July to spend more time with his family, according to a company memo.

Problems have continued to pop up. In December, the bank reached a $3.7 billion deal with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to resolve allegations that it harmed 16 million customers, including by wrongfully repossessing vehicles and unlawfully applying overdraft fees. Some actions took place as recently as 2022, according to the agency.",Wells Fargo Is Still in Fix-It Mode,non-causal,,[],[],[],['WFC'],-0.9994607

This would be on par with the process used for the chips inside Apple‚Äôs iPhones launched in 2018. Apple‚Äôs latest iPhone chips were made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, using what is known as the four-nanometer process. A nanometer is a measure of chip size, with the fewer nanometers in the process, the better. A piece of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick.

Few stakeholders have yet to voice opinions publicly, as industry groups seek to confirm more details and evaluate their stances. But there is no doubt the new Huawei phone has sparked discussions of what comes next. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of activity,‚Äù said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a nonprofit group that promotes trade between the United States and China.

Washington faced a similar quandary of how to hobble the Soviet Union‚Äôs technological development during the Cold War. Willy Shih, an economist at Harvard Business School, said Huawei‚Äôs breakthrough was evocative of what happened with Global Positioning System technology, now commonly known as GPS. The U.S. Defense Department developed the technology and restricted its export, wary of it in the hands of rivals. But the export restrictions pushed Moscow and other governments to develop their own versions, Shih said.

‚ÄúSo it went from a situation where the U.S. really dominated that technology and everyone would come to the U.S. to buy it, to now there are all these different alternatives,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd you have to wonder if the same thing is happening now with Huawei.‚Äù

Huawei had long been in the crosshairs of Washington as the sharpest tip of China‚Äôs tech industry. Since 2012, Huawei has been the world‚Äôs largest supplier of the equipment needed to operate the global internet, a position it has maintained despite U.S. sanctions. Huawei files more patent applications than any other company in China, and a constellation of Chinese start-ups rely on Huawei‚Äôs AI algorithms to build their own applications for face and voice recognition, pattern identification and other purposes.

In the wake of the sanctions, Ren Zhengfei, Huawei‚Äôs charismatic founder who got his start in China‚Äôs army engineering corps, rallied Huawei‚Äôs staff for an all-out fight for the survival of their company. They stockpiled chips from overseas suppliers, predicting that Washington might close loopholes in the sanctions. This indeed came to pass. Washington plugged the loopholes one by one, including sanctioning SMIC, the only factory in China potentially capable of manufacturing advanced chips for Huawei ‚Äî and pushing for suppliers of specialized chipmaking gear to halt sales to China more broadly.

SMIC has striven to make cutting-edge chips since its founding in 2000, but the dream had long seemed pie-in-the-sky. Each generation of chips reflects a new frontier in just how microscopically small humans can draw precise designs into a sheet of silicon. By the time SMIC caught up to one generation, industry leaders had raced further ahead based on new breakthroughs by the world‚Äôs brightest physicists and technicians.

Since the U.S. chip sanctions began, Beijing has flexed what muscles it can to prevent more of the global chip industry from falling under Washington‚Äôs sway. For instance, Intel recently announced it will have to pay $353 million in termination fees to Israel‚Äôs Tower Semiconductor after failing to acquire Chinese regulatory approval for the acquisition.",New phone sparks worry China has found a way around U.S. tech limits,non-causal,"SMIC, GPS, AI","['U', 'S', 'GPS', 'SMIC', 'AI']","['S', 'U']","['AI', 'SMIC', 'GPS']","['INTC', 'U', 'S', 'GPS', 'SMIC', 'AI']",-0.9999623

Hiring is challenging for every industry, but especially tech. The industry has been a hotbed of hiring for years, even more so during the pandemic when stay-at-home regulations boosted demand for home entertainment, digital technology and e-commerce.

A cut this dramatic would upend the lives of thousands and undo years of work in recruitment, employee development and institutional knowledge at the company.

The layoff of so many employees could also present serious concerns about cybersecurity, IT and the overall stability of the platform, said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities.

‚ÄúFifty percent layoffs is a potential backbreaker for Twitter,‚Äù he said. 

That means Twitter is on the hook to pay massive amounts of interest, as well as the loans themselves.

With a whopping $13 billion of new debt hanging over the social media company, Musk needs Twitter to turn a profit ‚Äî quickly.

‚ÄúThe debt component is an albatross around the Twitter story,‚Äù Ives said. The firm has been largely unprofitable for most of its existence as a public company, losing $270 million in its last quarterly report in June after bringing in a disappointing $1.18 billion in revenue.

Getting out from under so much debt as a mature company in a competitive sector will be difficult, Ives said.

The workforce is highly skilled and hard to recruit. Companies must develop and improve employees‚Äô capabilities to stay ahead of the competition. Keeping experienced and talented workers requires high salaries and perks.

‚ÄúCompetition for highly skilled personnel is intense,‚Äù Twitter said in its 2014 annual report, shortly after the company went public. ‚ÄúOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees.‚Äù

In 2013, Twitter employed a little more than 2,700 people. By 2021, the company had grown to more than 7,500 full-time employees.

But days after Elon Musk acquired the social media platform, the world‚Äôs wealthiest man is expected to slash about half its workforce, or about 3,700 jobs. All employees were set to be notified by 9 a.m. Friday if they still had a job, according to a company email shared with the Los Angeles Times.

This year has been a tough one for the tech industry ‚Äî amid the economic turmoil, there have been hiring freezes at major firms like Google and Meta and layoffs at companies as diverse as Coinbase and Netflix. But laying off 50% of a company‚Äôs workforce is ‚Äúout of any norm,‚Äù Anat Lechner, business professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, said Thursday before news of the layoffs became official.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall any instance that is of that magnitude,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in this space since the late ‚Äò80s. I just do not recall something like this.‚Äù

Even historically large cuts, like the 2012 layoff of 2,000 Yahoo employees in a turnaround attempt, made up only 14% of the company‚Äôs workforce.

For tech companies that matured after the dotcom crash, it‚Äôs even more unusual. The industry has been a hotbed of hiring for years, even more so during the pandemic when stay-at-home regulations boosted demand for home entertainment, digital technology and e-commerce.

‚ÄúFifty percent layoffs is a potential backbreaker for Twitter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCuts were going to come. 50% is a jaw-dropping number.‚Äù

The key to understanding the scale of the rumored cuts is the mechanism Musk used to purchase Twitter.

To fund his $44-billion acquisition, the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX CEO financed the deal with debt borrowed from banks. In this kind of leveraged buyout, it is the company ‚Äî not Musk ‚Äî that is loaded up with the debt.

That means Twitter is on the hook to pay massive amounts of interest, as well as the loans themselves.

With a whopping $13 billion of new debt hanging over the social media company, Musk needs Twitter to turn a profit ‚Äî quickly.

‚ÄúThe debt component is an albatross around the Twitter story,‚Äù Ives said. ‚ÄúThe cash flow now needs to come from Twitter, and there‚Äôs only one way that that‚Äôs going to happen, which is through headcount costs. It‚Äôs put a huge pressure from a cost perspective on the Twitter story that was not there before this deal.‚Äù

Twitter‚Äôs business was not necessarily thriving before the acquisition. The firm has been largely unprofitable for most of its existence as a public company, losing $270 million in its last quarterly report in June after bringing in a disappointing $1.18 billion in revenue.

After totaling just $8 billion in Q1 2023, M&A transactions cited by EIR during Q2 came to triple that number, accompanied by a revived focus on the acquisition of drilling positions in the prolific Permian Basin of west Texas and southeast New Mexico.

‚ÄúThe second quarter saw a thunderous return to Permian M&A after a relatively quiet start to the year,‚Äù said Andrew Dittmar, director at Enverus. ‚ÄúThe need for public buyers to secure quality drilling inventory has been brewing, and the pressure to make a deal has been mounting as the remaining opportunities are narrowed with each successive transaction. That in turn is driving higher valuations on the remaining assets.‚Äù

In an interview this week, Dittmar told me that, while what he called ‚Äúinteresting opportunities‚Äù for future deals in other shale basins remain, the superior quality and quantity of rock and the lower breakeven prices that sets up were the main reasons why focus returned to the Permian following a first quarter that saw multiple deals in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas. ‚ÄúWe classify prospects that break even at less than $50 WTI as being tier one,‚Äù Dittmar says. ‚ÄúSo, if you want to have that quality of inventory, there's really just not a lot of places you can buy it outside the Permian.‚Äù

One place outside the Permian where Chevron went shopping during the 2nd quarter is the Denver Julesburg (DJ) Basin. Chevron has long been a prominent player in the DJ and decided to increase its position there with the biggest deal of the quarter, a $7.6 billion takeover of PDC Energy. Dittmar made clear his assessment that the PDC portfolio is filled with tier one prospects.

‚ÄúThe rock in the DJ looks fantastic,‚Äù Dittmar says. ‚ÄúDefinitely sub-$50 break evens, even into the low forties in some cases. We think Chevron was able to get a pretty good deal on PDC. It‚Äôs paying well less than $1 million per location, whereas inventory of that quality in the Permian would cost you significantly more than that.‚Äù

Civitas Resources, with its splash entry into the Permian Basin via a pair of $2 billion+ buyouts of TapRock Resources and Hibernia Energy III, presents another interesting case given its status as a pure-play DJ Basin producer to this point. ‚ÄúWe like the TapRock deal a little bit better, both in terms of where the valuation landed and the underlying quality of the asset,‚Äù Dittmar says. ‚ÄúWe think that the best of the TapRock assets are going to be the very best that Civitas has going forward. So, while the DJ actually has very good rock, that tier one Delaware stuff is just another league in terms of the quality. Hibernia in the Southern Midland was maybe a little bit more expensive than we've seen some deals in terms of that asset quality price. You‚Äôre taking a step towards the margin of the basin there on the southern side.‚Äù

Having said that, Dittmar also says he thinks the margins of the Permian region could hold a good deal of upside potential for buyers. ‚ÄúOne of the stories we're seeing in the Permian Basin is that there's the locations you think are there based on existing wells and proven results, and then there's the locations that no one has tried that on bench in that area yet. So geologically, it looks like it has a lot of potential. I think that‚Äôs why some of these buyers are moving towards the margins of the basin.‚Äù

When asked if he foresees more consolidation coming to the U.S. shale business, Dittmar‚Äôs answer was unequivocal. ‚ÄúThere's still too many public companies out there - I think that's been a consensus in shale since the get-go, almost,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd the more consolidated industry makes sense from a strategic perspective. It makes sense for investors. You have lower G&A (general and administrative) costs. We're better able to tackle the regulatory and environmental concerns. So, I think we do need to see more consolidation in the industry.‚Äù

This most recent quarter‚Äôs M&A activity displays a continuation of several long-term factors impacting the U.S. shale space: Increased consolidation with a focus on lower costs, enhancing economies of scale, raising the acquiring company‚Äôs inventory of tier one drilling locations, creating free cash flow, and improving returns to investors.

As Dittmar notes, these have really been the overriding goals that have driven consolidation in the shale sector since the shale revolution began in earnest in the first years of this century, and there seems little reason to expect these drivers to shift in the coming years.",Oil And Gas Merger Action Surges After A Dormant First Quarter,non-causal,"III, PDC, EIR, DJ, WTI","['M', 'DJ', 'U', 'S', 'EIR', 'PDC', 'A', 'III']","['S', 'M', 'A', 'U']","['III', 'DJ', 'EIR', 'PDC', 'WTI']","['M', 'DJ', 'U', 'WTI', 'S', 'EIR', 'CVX', 'PDC', 'A', 'III']",-0.5964823

A federal judge in the United States has ruled that two major airlines must end their regional partnership in the country‚Äôs northeast within 30 days, citing the risk of higher fares and reduced competition.

Friday‚Äôs decision, concerning American Airlines and JetBlue Airways, hands a victory to the US Justice Department, which sued in 2021 to block the ‚Äúunprecedented domestic alliance‚Äù between the two carriers.

In his ruling, US District Judge Leo Sorokin denounced the deal as entangling ‚ÄúJetBlue with American in a way that diminishes its status as an independent, low-cost player in the market‚Äù.

He also echoed the Justice Department‚Äôs concerns that the partnership would stifle competition from other airlines.

‚ÄúThese two powerful carriers act as one entity in the northeast, allocating markets between them and replacing full-throated competition with broad cooperation,‚Äù Sorokin wrote in his decision.

But JetBlue and American Airlines have argued that their partnership, dubbed the Northeast Alliance, would have, in fact, allowed the two air carriers to better compete in the region against rivals like Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.

‚ÄúWe made it clear at trial that the Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers,‚Äù a spokesperson for JetBlue said in a statement after Friday‚Äôs decision.

The spokesperson added that the partnership allowed the budget airline to expand its ‚Äúlow fares and great service to more routes than would have been possible otherwise‚Äù.

American Airlines likewise blasted the judge‚Äôs ruling. ‚ÄúThe court‚Äôs legal analysis is plainly incorrect and unprecedented for a joint venture,‚Äù the company said.

Both JetBlue and American Airlines saw a dip in their shares following the ruling, with a 1.8 and 1.5 percent tumble respectively.

The two companies first announced a deal in July 2020 to sell seats on each other‚Äôs flights, in a bid to bolster their markets in New York and Boston.

The alliance was approved by the outgoing administration of Republican President Donald Trump and took effect in early 2021. But by September of that year, the US Justice Department under Democratic President Joe Biden sued to have the alliance stopped.

‚ÄúIn an industry where just four airlines control more than 80 percent of domestic air travel, American Airlines‚Äô ‚Äòalliance‚Äô with JetBlue is, in fact, an unprecedented maneuver to further consolidate the industry,‚Äù Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, said in a statement at the time.

Six states and the District of Colombia also joined the anti-trust lawsuit, alleging harm to consumers. The lawyers for the Justice Department cited estimates that the alliance could cost ticket buyers anywhere between $500m to $700m in higher fares per year.

American Airlines has the largest fleet of any airline in the US, and JetBlue the sixth largest.

The Biden administration has been aggressively pursuing antitrust cases since taking office, including in other industries including sugar refinery, internet advertising, health insurance and more.

Friday‚Äôs case was not the only ant-trust suit it has filed against the budget airline JetBlue. In March, it launched a complaint in Massachusetts to block JetBlue‚Äôs acquisition of another low-cost airline, Spirit, again citing the prospect of reduced competition and higher prices.

The results seem better than expected.

Workers have endured a lot recently. Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closed down due, in part, to a run on the banks out of fear of losing their life savings. Following the bank collapses, there was a palpable fear of a full-blown banking crisis.

There has been a steady stream of layoffs, hiring freezes, record levels of inflation and rising interest rates making the costs of everything more expensive.

The start of the 2023 second quarter finds UBS‚Äôs acquisition of ailing Credit Suisse, which could lead to massive layoffs. Artificial intelligence could wipe out 300 million jobs, according to Goldman Sachs, and oil production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will drive the prices of gas higher into the summer travel season. Mysteriously, McDonald‚Äôs shut down its home offices this week to figure out who and how many people the iconic burger chain will let go.

With concerns over the viability of Swiss-based Credit Suisse, intra-country competitor UBS bought out the bank under pressure from Swiss regulators. Since both institutions offer similar financial services and have offices in many countries around the world, including a sizable presence in the U.S., there is a chance that jobs could be made redundant.

The two banks offer investment banking, high-net-worth wealth management, asset management, stock and bond sales and trading. UBS has more than 74,000 employees working from nearly 50 countries. Credit Suisse is also global and the second largest Swiss bank with around 50,480 employees.

Since there‚Äôs overlap in nearly all the divisions, intense competition between talented people at each organization will occur to keep their jobs. To slash costs and integrate the two entities efficiently, UBS, the stronger of the banks, will cut around 20% to 30% of its 120,000 global workforce after completing its merger with Credit Suisse. The numbers are staggering, as roughly 36,000 bankers, brokers, traders, wealth managers and compliance personnel will be laid off.

McDonald's announced that it would temporarily shut down its United States offices this week. The closure will bide time for the global fast-food chain to determine layoffs and corporate restructuring, and alert the affected employees, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Last week, workers were told via email to stay at home and work remotely for the first few days of the week. All in-person meetings with outside entities will be canceled.

Waiting is the hardest part. McDonald‚Äôs has more than 150,000 employees in corporate roles. Many people will be anxious and stressed out over whether or not they‚Äôll have a job. In a white-collar recession, it's not a good time for a middle corporate manager or executive to be let go, as it will be difficult and time-consuming to procure another opportunity at the same level and compensation package.

Adding to the employees‚Äô worries, McDonald‚Äôs in January said its Accelerating the Arches program will place emphasis on ‚Äúdeliveries, drive-thru, digital and development,‚Äù and didn‚Äôt mention what will happen with the college-educated office workers.

Cuts In Oil Production Driving Up The Costs Of Summer Traveling

Families going through McDonald‚Äôs drive-thrus will be spending more money on gasoline, as Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced that there would be oil output cuts of around 1.16 million barrels per day. The reduction in drilling and production will cause an immediate rise in prices, which the U.S. called ‚Äúinadvisable,‚Äù Reuters reported.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday at an event at Yale University that OPEC+‚Äôs cut to oil production is a ""regrettable action"" that will add to the current global economic uncertainty. The decision will cause further financial strain to consumers already burdened by high inflation.

Oil prices jumped on Monday. St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard was surprised over OPEC+'s sudden and unexpected decision to cut crude production. The move may make things challenging for the Fed, as it is desperately trying to bring down record inflation levels. There are some concerns that stagflation may result as inflation remains stubbornly high. While Fed chair Jerome Powell wants inflation to go down to around 2%, Bullard said in an interview with Bloomberg last month that his own forecast is for rates to peak at 5.625% this year.

Workers And Job Hunters Will Be Harmed By AI And Ghost Jobs

Goldman Sachs, the highly regarded New York City-based investment bank, wrote a sobering and alarming research report about the ascendency of artificial intelligence. Goldman maintains that if generative AI lives up to its hype, the workforce in the U.S. and Europe will be upended. The bank estimates that 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished due to this fast-growing technology.

Office administrative support, legal, architecture and engineering, business and financial operations, management, sales, healthcare and art and design are some sectors that automation will impact. AI is anticipated to replace workers in a wide array of sectors ultimately. In the past, blue-collar and frontline workers usually bore the brunt of painful changes created by technological innovations. This time, it‚Äôs after the office class.

Job seekers are chasing ghosts. In a survey conducted by Clarify Capital, around 25% of hiring managers self-reported that they‚Äôve kept job listings open for more than four months. Moreover, they don‚Äôt intend to hire anyone in the near future.

The reasons for posting ‚Äúghost jobs‚Äù include building a pipeline of candidates for when the tide turns and recruiting gears up again, making it seem as if the company is doing well and expanding, humoring employees that help is on the horizon with new staff arriving to help with the workload, languishing on job aggregation sites and human resources and hiring managers forgetting to take down old job listings.","Workers Face Fears Of Further Layoffs, AI Stealing Jobs And Higher Inflation",causal,"UBS, OPEC, AI","['A', 'UBS', 'OPEC']",['AI'],"['AI', 'UBS', 'OPEC']","['GS', 'UBS', 'AI', 'A', 'OPEC']",-0.0143544935

One of the fastest growing markets As many as 685 million people are expected to fly in India in 2042 compared to the 165 million in 2019, according to Airbus‚Äôs 20-year forecast released in June 2023. This makes India the third largest civil aviation market after China and the United States and one of the fastest growing ones. A Barclays report released in June shows that Indian carriers account for nearly 7% of the industry backlog of orders, the second largest in the world after the U.S. In such a rapidly growing market, the presence of two large and established players could lead to price increases in the future. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãIndia does look to move towards just two main players in the aviation space in future. While there remains a fear of a duopoly, the Air India group will take a while to consolidate,‚Äù Amey Joshi, an independent aviation analyst, told Reuters.

As IndiGo and Air India group airlines consolidated their presence in the market, their competition either folded or found themselves in legal trouble and lost consumer confidence. Since 2010, two full service carriers have ceased operations in India. Kingfisher Airlines shut in 2012 after it could not pay its outstanding dues to aircraft lessors, oil companies, airports and salaries to its staff. Jet Airways met with the same fate in 2019 due to similar reasons. The latest casualty is low-cost carrier Go First. It filed for voluntary insolvency in May and its bankruptcy filing showed that it owes $798 million to its financial creditors although the company said that it had not defaulted on any of its dues. The airline had a market share of 6.4% in April, the month before it stopped flying, which fell to 0.4% in May. After being grounded for nearly three months, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on July 21 that the airline could resume operations provided it met certain conditions. As of publication of this piece, it had canceled all its flights until July 25. The last long-standing competitor SpiceJet is not without its problems. Its market share decreased to 4.4% in June 2023 from 13.4% in January 2019. Its financials have not been too rosy either as it has posted a loss in eight of its last 10 quarters, and its share price has fallen by 18% in 2023. Currently, its share trading has been suspended. It also faces insolvency pleas from lessors.

Akasa - the new airline on the block Budget carrier Akasa Air started commercial operations in August last year. In a short span of 10 months, its market share has grown to 4.8% from 0.2%. Presently it is scheduled to operate to and from 20 destinations in India until October. It is also eyeing expanding its network and fleet and said at the Paris Airshow that it is on course to announce another significant three-digit aircraft order by the end of 2023.

The United States and Brazil are two other major domestic aviation markets in which private carriers operate. And the market is evenly split among three or more airlines in both countries. In the U.S., four major airlines - American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines - occupied around 67% of the domestic market between April 2022 to March 2023 while other smaller and regional airlines accounted for the rest.

Kroger has adopted an omnichannel strategy, integration of offline or in-store sales with online orders and logistics. It's a concept that originated in China in 2016 when founder Jack Ma of e-commerce giant Alibaba coined the term ""New Retail"" and proceeded to open 300 high-tech Freshippo-branded supermarkets in 27 Chinese cities. This ""New Retail"" model has been ""cut and pasted from businesses that worked in China,"" said Michael Zakkour, founder of digital commerce and retail consultancy 5 New Digital in New York. ""We are seeing it with Kroger, Target and Walmart. They looked at the New Retail model born in China for complete integration of offline and online channels,"" he said. ""Same-day delivery, restaurants in store, app-driven sales and QR codes are all bright spots in every single one of them, and all happened first in China."" At first, the highly competitive and fragmented U.S. food retailing business was slow to catch on. But the action was jumpstarted when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market in 2017 and began introducing several advanced technologies to streamline in-store shopping, a shift that also spread to large retailers Walmart and Target. ""You just can't be a 1990s grocer. You have to be courageous, break things, and quickly adapt,"" said Yael Cosset, senior vice president and chief information officer at Kroger, who is leading its tech and digital initiatives. In a nod to Alibaba, he said the Chinese e-commerce company ""has done a fantastic job in reinventing the retail model, a convergence of brick and mortar with e-commerce in an online and offline world.""

Cosset has been spearheading introduction of the omnichannel shopping experience. Kroger's new retailing links together shopping, e-commerce and logistics: automated fulfillment centers bag groceries; vans make same-day deliveries to households; data analytics provide an early read on customer trends; mobile apps distribute customer promotions and coupons; on-premise ""ghost kitchens"" prepare meals for in-store pickup or van delivery; QR codes handle payments online at self check-outs; and large online fulfillment centers and warehouses rely on robots for packing, sorting and loading orders. New automated fulfillment centers are a critical part of the technology effort. These centers use AI and robotics to replace labor-intensive work of sorting and bagging groceries for delivery, while on-site employees handle such operations as engineering and inventory management. ""When you look at retail, there are two big enablers: tech and data science, and secondly, supply chain logistics and fulfillment,"" Zakkour said. ""The lesson that American retailers are learning is that their operations can be more efficient with higher margins when retail and e-commerce are seamlessly integrated."" Zakkour credited Kroger for being one of the more progressive U.S. retailers in implementing this omnichannel approach. Competitors Walmart and Target are spending heavily, even in a slowing economy, and with technology a focus among current capex investments. ""A company that doesn't have a laser beam focus on tech that Kroger does is vulnerable,"" said Jim Russell, principal at investment firm Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati. ""These digital trends continue to roll forward, and Kroger is delivering very strong results in the pandemic and post-pandemic period.""

Digital grocery shopping took off during Covid, as customers favored e-commerce, eating at home, and prepared meals. Kroger's digital business scaled to more than $10 billion in 2020, and has grown by 113 percent during the past two years. Building on this momentum, Kroger aims to double its digital revenues by the end of 2023. Kroger digital sales gained by 8 percent in the second quarter of 2022, while in-store and online combined gained 5.8 percent from a year earlier. Supermarkets had been lagging other sectors in e-commerce with three to four percent of total sales but tripled during the pandemic, according to McKinsey, which predicts that e-commerce will represent 18 percent of supermarket sales within the next three to five years. ""We are finding out now how well this digital shift is working at Kroger,"" Russell said. He pointed out that ""half of Kroger's app stores are bringing in incremental business and half are cannibalizing in-store sales."" Total company sales rose 4.1 percent in 2021 to $137.9 billion, and Kroger is expecting a gain in the range of 4 percent to 4.5 percent for 2022.

Under a Restock Kroger initiative begun five years ago, the grocer combined physical and digital experiences, a strategy that has required major, long-term investment in robotics and supply chain management, as well as data analytics to understand and predict customer habits, and to personalize marketing. ""We are leveraging data to engage with customers through digital channels such as apps and web site logins to make the customer interactions relevant, and bring to life personalized shopping experiences,"" Cosset said. He pointed out that large stores can lose the personal connection with customers that a local shop provides. But by using data and technology, Kroger can link better to customers and personalize ads and promotions online. Cosset joined Kroger in 2015 when the grocery chain acquired the U.S. assets of its partner, London-based data science company dunnhumby, where he held leadership posts. Kroger created 84.51¬∞ as a new business out of dunnhumbyUSA, serving Kroger and other clients including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Tesco. Cosset began leading Kroger's digital growth strategy and e-commerce in 2017, and was promoted in 2019 to also take charge of technology, and his role expanded again two years ago to include oversight of the grocer's data insights unit 84.51¬∞. Another acquisition that proved key to the new strategy was U.K.-based grocery e-commerce company Ocado Group, which Kroger bought in 2018 and partnered with to bring its home delivery platform to the U.S.. Kroger opened its first three Ocado-run centers near Cincinnati, Atlanta and Orlando in 2021, and this year has added Dallas and Wisconsin. Several more locations are planned. These giant hubs can handle thousands of online orders daily, and smaller facilities in spoke locations provide last-mile deliveries from delivery vans that can handle 20 orders at a time. ""Grocery in the U.S. has been behind the curve historically relative to the U.K., France and Germany,"" said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy, North America, at Publicis Sapient.

1,good,True,positive,393,"The Federal Trade Commission is seeking to block Amgen's $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, citing the company's pending patent expirations as a potential source of competitive action. However, the company is facing stiff competition from rival drugs such as AbbVie's Humira and is offering steep rebates to middlemen known as pharmacy-benefit managers to protect its market share. The FTC is likely to prevail, partly due to the FTC's claim that Amgen might ‚Äòundle‚Äô these medicines to patients. Wall Street is skeptical that such drugs will be able to compete, as Tepezza for thyroid eye disease is a good drug, but it might be too good from Wall Street's perspective.",The biotech company is facing a patent cliff scarier than Washington‚Äôs actions.,ABBV,Health Care,Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals,AbbVie Inc.,2023-05-24T11:00:00+00:00,2023-05-24,2023-05-24T11:00:00+00:00,[{'name': 'Politics'}],"Amgen AMGN 0.20%increase; green up pointing triangle isn‚Äôt getting much love from Washington these days.

The Internal Revenue Service has gone after the biotech for billions of dollars in back taxes. Lina Khan‚Äôs Federal Trade Commission is seeking to block its $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics (a move some insiders think was at least partly prompted by a blistering letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren). And, in rare unanimity for a polarized institution, the Supreme Court recently ruled against Amgen in an important patent case.

But Amgen‚Äôs looming patent cliff is the bigger headache. Many of the company‚Äôs top-selling drugs are set to face sharp revenue declines later this decade as their patents expire and competition stiffens. And while Amgen has introduced new products‚Äîincluding the cholesterol drug Repatha that was the subject of the patent-infringement lawsuit‚Äîits growth prospects toward the end of the decade look challenging.

One drug under threat is blockbuster Enbrel, a treatment for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. While the drug doesn‚Äôt lose exclusivity until 2029, it is already facing headwinds because AbbVie‚Äôs Humira, a competitor, is putting pressure on the entire class of drugs. Both drugs work by blocking a substance known as tumor necrosis factor, which contributes to inflammation. But AbbVie is now facing biosimilar competition and, to protect its market share, it has been offering steep rebates to the middlemen known as pharmacy-benefit managers. The bigger rebates could in turn take away market share from similar drugs such as Enbrel, says Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird. Enbrel brought in $579 million in total sales during the first quarter, badly missing analyst estimates of $817 million according to a poll by Visible Alpha. Another drug, Otezla, also missed estimates due to competition from a Bristol-Myers Squibb competitor. Prolia and Xgeva, two bone health drugs, have helped offset some of that growth pressure, but they too face patent expirations later this decade.

To respond to patent expirations, big pharma can boost its in-house research and development efforts, buy or partner with a string of small companies or swallow another large company. With the Horizon deal, Amgen opted for the third option, attracting antitrust scrutiny. But even before the FTC action, investors didn‚Äôt exactly love the acquisition.

The stock declined in the weeks following the deal‚Äôs announcement, partly in reaction to Amgen‚Äôs paying a hefty price and assuming a large amount of debt to finance the deal. But part of the concern might also stem from the growth trajectory for Horizon‚Äôs key product. The crown jewel in the acquisition is the drug Tepezza for thyroid eye disease. The drug raked in nearly $2 billion in 2022. To make the Horizon deal work, Amgen would want to see those sales continue to climb. Horizon in November upped its guidance for the treatment, predicting more than $4 billion in peak sales. But Wall Street is skeptical.

After Horizon reported a 19% slide in Tepezza sales to $405 million in the first quarter, SVB Securities analyst David Risinger lowered his peak annual sales estimate from $3.5 billion to $3.1 billion, noting that fewer U.S. patients are being treated than he had anticipated. Tepezza is indeed a good drug, but it might be too good from Wall Street‚Äôs perspective‚Äîpatients normally undergo a six-month treatment and then stop.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a finite duration regimen,‚Äù Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore, wrote after the Horizon deal was first announced. ‚ÄúAnd such drugs always peak fast.‚Äù

One way in which Amgen could benefit from the deal in America‚Äôs convoluted healthcare system, the FTC contends, is by leveraging a broader suite of products during negotiations with the vertically integrated health insurers. According to this rationale, Amgen would use the Horizon products to cross-bundle its products, meaning it would condition rebates to pharmacy-benefit managers on a product in exchange for preferred formulary placements for other Amgen drugs. Amgen says it won‚Äôt do that.

‚ÄúThe FTC‚Äôs claim that Amgen might ‚Äòbundle‚Äô these medicines (offer a multi-product discount) at some point in the future is entirely speculative and does not reflect the real world competitive dynamics behind providing rare-disease medicines to patients,‚Äù the company wrote in response to the FTC action.

Most legal experts think Amgen will eventually prevail over the FTC, partly because the judge slated to hear the case was nominated by former President Donald Trump. Ironically, if the FTC were to win, though, investors probably wouldn‚Äôt mind all that much. And that is the bigger problem for Amgen: Wall Street is unimpressed with the company‚Äôs growth prospects with or without Horizon.",Elizabeth Warren and the FTC Are the Least of Amgen‚Äôs Problems,causal,"AMGN, SVB, FTC",['FTC'],[],"['SVB', 'AMGN', 'FTC']","['SVB', 'AMGN', 'FTC', 'ABBV']",0.826247
