We've got a lot to cover today, so even though I have loads to say about the cultural cornerstone that is Fat Bear Week, we better get straight to the news.

Today, senior correspondent Linette Lopez has an analysis on Elon Musk, and why he may be woefully behind the curve.

1. Has Elon Musk lost his Midas touch? Elon Musk built his fortune on being first, senior correspondent Linette Lopez writes. He was early to see the potential of mass-producing electric cars and reusable rockets. But his big bets with Twitter and Tesla are behind the curve ‚Äî and they could blow up in his face.
‚Ä¢ The first of these poorly timed bets, Linette writes, is Twitter. During the pandemic, tech stocks ‚Äî including social-media companies ‚Äî were flying high. Since then, the stock market has gotten smashed, and social-media stocks have been some of the hardest hit.
‚Ä¢ Musk's second behind-the-times bet is the Chinese consumer. Musk needs a healthy Chinese market to validate Tesla's big investment in the country, but given a weak consumer sentiment and a slowing economy, it may not be there for him.
‚Ä¢ This will be his companies' first attempt at surviving a stock-market collapse and a global economic downturn. These kinds of economic conditions rock even the most stable companies, and neither Tesla ‚Äî which just started making money last year ‚Äî nor Twitter has ever been that.

Plus, staying with Musk, a judge thinks it's possible that Twitter whistleblower Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko emailed Musk's attorney to ask for a job, months before he came forward with his claims against the social media company. We've got the details here.

2. Analysis: Apple's innovation hasn't just slowed, it's plateaued. At the company's latest product launch event, Apple showed off a slate of products with just small changes that are basically just checklist items disguised as features. Why boring is what's new at Apple.

3. Insiders describe confusion and frustration about Hulu's future. With the CEOs of Disney and Comcast publicly sparring over Hulu, some industry insiders have begun wondering how soon Hulu's joint ownership could resolve, and what the streamer will become. A look at the fear over Hulu's future.

4. The percentage of electric-vehicle owners in the US who switch back to gas is shrinking. New data shows that between 2021 and 2022, the share of EV owners who went back to gas cars decreased by around 17%. Why people are sticking with EVs.

5. A leaked video shows ghost-kitchen startup Reef's CEO telling workers to report issues that might run afoul of city rules. Last week, the CEO urged workers to internally report conduct that might violate health and permitting rules. His remarks came after Insider reported new trailer shutdowns and violations at the SoftBank-backed startup. Read more of his comments.

1,good,True,positive,12453,"Financial missteps when starting out of college can lead to costly and long-term consequences. Students should understand that the true cost of college goes way beyond tuition, room and board, and use sample budgets to track their spending. Electronic payment apps like Venmo or Zelle can help with this, and students with bank accounts should set up alerts to monitor their account balances. Many banks still charge overdraft fees, which can add up if a student isn't keeping track of their balance in real-time, and some banks offer overdraft protection. Students may also try to use their refund quickly on nonessential items later when they really need it.","For many students, managing finances is new, and they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re prone to make all sorts of mistakes",DFS,Financials,Consumer Finance,Discover Financial Services,2023-05-05T19:05:15+00:00,2023-05-05,2023-05-05T19:05:15+00:00,[{'name': 'Finance'}],"We are presumably at the end stages of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate hike cycle, which has seen the central bank increase rates at the quickest pace in its history. The rapid rate hikes are intended to cool economic growth, and investors have been nervously speculating about where the impact of the rate hikes would first appear. Would it show up as an economic recession, evidenced by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth? Perhaps higher rates would trigger a sharp uptick in corporate defaults, particularly in riskier subprime loans and high yield bonds? Would the rate hikes cause consumers and businesses to curtail spending, triggering an earnings recession marked by lower corporate profits?

Thus far, none of the above have shown a concerning level of impact from the Fed rate hikes. GDP growth for Q1 did decline, from 2.6% in Q4 of 2022 to 1.1%, but considering that nearly every major investment bank was calling for negative or flat GDP growth when they issued their annual market outlooks, a positive 1.1% rate of growth is something of a victory for the US economy and aligns with our Annual Outlook forecast for the US to narrowly avert recession. The resilient US consumer has continued to spend aggressively, buoyed by full employment and rising wages, despite higher prices for goods and services.

Likewise, corporate bond defaults have remained manageable despite some high-profile instances such as Bed Bath and Beyond and Silicon Valley Bank. The trailing 12-month (TTM) default rate for US high yield bonds reached 1.8% in March, up from historic lows but still below the long-term historical average of 3.6%. Current forecasts from Fitch Ratings suggest 2023‚Äôs high yield TTM rate will top out in the 3-3.5% range, which would still be below the historical norms and far below what occurred in prior recessionary environments, such as 2008-2010, when high yield default rates peaked around 22%.

And what of earnings? Analysts were near-unanimous in calling for a first-quarter earnings recession, a valid assumption as most companies were careful to temper expectations for 2023 growth when they issued guidance at the end of 2022. FactSet data showed expectations for a 6.7% decline in Q1 earnings, based on aggregated analyst forecasts. We are roughly halfway through Q1 earnings and thus far, that decline is looking more like -3.7%, the second straight quarter of declining earnings, but not as bad as initially thought.

Furthermore, 77% of S&P 500 companies have beaten analyst targets for earnings, above the 10-year average beat rate of 73%. Earnings are coming in 6.9% above estimates, which is also above the 10-year average of 6.4%. Positive surprises are also showing up in revenue data, with 74% of S&P 500 companies beating estimates, outperforming the 10-year average of 63%. Revenue beats are also outperforming 10-year averages, at 2.1% above estimates compared to the 10-year average benchmark of 1.3%.

While there may have been some sandbagging of expectations leading up to Q1 earnings, the fact remains that corporate earnings are not suffering in a significant way due to the Fed rate hikes. Rather, most companies have been able to simply pass on higher input costs to consumers, who have willingly continued to spend money despite their grumblings over the cost of eggs, gas, and other household staples. A recent research paper from economists at the University of Massachusetts suggests corporations have been able to pad their profit margins by implementing price hikes that exceeded the cost of inflation, resulting in record high profit margins.

Corporations were able to pull this off because price hikes (or shrinkage of product sizes) have been implemented in a unified fashion, leading consumers to accept the rationale that supply chain bottlenecks and higher input costs are solely to blame. This has instilled companies with confidence that they can raise prices without damaging their brand image and products demand, and thus far, this assumption has proven correct. Corporate profit margins hit their highest levels since the 1950s last year, and while they have declined from the peak, remain above pre-pandemic norms.

While this form of quasi-coordinated price gouging is bad for the average household budget, it has been a boon for corporate earnings. Companies will be loath to give up these higher margins and will try to maintain higher prices permanently unless consumer spending behavior changes dramatically. It is no coincidence that, thus far with half of the sector‚Äôs earnings in, 100% of Consumer Staples sector stocks have beaten earnings estimates.

Energy sector stocks have also been strong outperformers, as has the largest sector by market cap, Technology. Among big Tech names, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) posted strong earnings this quarter and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) turned a profit in its cloud business segment for the first time on record. While big Tech layoffs made headlines early in the year, many reports failed to point out that these layoffs represent a fraction of the headcount added shortly after the start of the pandemic, and these companies continue to invest in their business and in many cases also aggressively buy back shares.

Whatever the underlying reasons, it appears that the widely forecasted earnings apocalypse has been postponed, and first quarter earnings will be better than expected. While higher yields on bonds have attracted investors to the detriment of equity markets, markets are forward-looking and investors will likely reassess EPS projections for 2024 considering the Q1 earnings performance, which could lead to upward revisions for next year and lead to inflows to equity markets. Markets have proven remarkably resilient throughout the Fed rate hike cycle, and while we are not yet in the clear, thus far we have avoided worst-case outcomes in several areas of concern. Strong corporate earnings are an encouraging sign; now, we wait and watch the inflation data to see if the Fed can defy expectations and pull off the coveted soft landing.",Resilient Earnings Are A Positive Sign,causal,"TTM, US, EPS, MSFT, GDP, GOOG, META",[],[],"['GDP', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'META', 'TTM', 'EPS', 'US']","['GDP', 'DFS', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'META', 'TTM', 'EPS', 'US']",0.9828509
1,good,True,positive,11557,"Homebuilders are jacking up prices on new construction due to an acute shortage of previously owned homes due to high mortgage rates. The shortages have powered homebuilders' earnings, sending their stocks soaring, and the S&P Composite 1500 Homebuilding Sub Index up 41.90% so far this year. The current average rate of above 7% on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage is making upgrading homes less attractive, squeezing the pool of existing homes, which are typically more affordable than new construction. Homebuilders on average have raised prices in about two-thirds of their communities, and this comes as the pricing gap between existing and new homes has narrowed, following a price appreciation in the resale market. Room for further price hikes and faster construction cycles will continue to lift the profit margins for homebuilders in the second half of the year, but analysts predict that this will force them to remain sensitive to market traffic and sentiment among customers when it comes to the degree of price hikes implemented.","Homebuilders are enjoying this turn of events after a gnarly second-half last year, when fears of rising interest rates slowing demand had forced them to cut prices and offer incentives to boost sa‚Äö√Ñ¬∂",LEN,Infrastructure,Home Builders,Lennar Corp A,2023-06-12T10:00:38+00:00,2023-06-12,2023-06-12T10:00:38+00:00,[{'name': 'Tech'}],"As a national radio host, I‚Äôve heard all the tech questions over the years. ""Is Facebook always listening to me?"" They don‚Äôt need to ‚Äî since they collect so much info about you.

""How do I know if someone is snooping on my computer?"" Not all snoops realize they leave tech breadcrumbs. You can outsmart them.

Those questions come year after year, but I took on answering some new ones, too. Keep reading if you‚Äôre sick of long-winded recipe blogs, your printer is acting up, or you‚Äôre upgrading to a new phone any time soon.

1. Use your phone to make house chores easier

Question: ""I can never hang up pictures straight. There‚Äôs got to be an app for that, right?""

DOES YOUR PC'S MOTHERBOARD HAVE HIDDEN VULNERABILITY THAT COULD PUT YOU AT RISK?

There‚Äôs an app for just about everything! Just hanging one thing?
‚Ä¢ On iPhone, open the Measure app, then tap Level on the bottom right. The level will appear on the screen. Cool.
‚Ä¢ On an Android, open the Google app or your browser and search for ""bubble level."" Use it like a normal level, placing it on a surface.

Hanging one picture is easy. But what if you have four pictures with two hooks on the back and want them hung exactly 5.5 inches apart?
‚Ä¢ Use the app Hang-a-Pic. You choose how many pictures, hooks, and dimensions. The app tells you exactly where to place the nails on your phone, or you can print complete directions via email.

You can use your phone to help you hang a TV, too. Nice. What about cleaning the dusty screen? Here‚Äôs the best way to do it.

2. Talk to a human at Amazon about your order

Question: ""I'm having problems with an Amazon order and don't want to deal with chat support. Is it possible to talk to someone, anyone at Amazon?""

There's bound to be the occasional issue with an order. Avoid the chatbots and essay-length exchanges with third-party sellers with this neat trick:
‚Ä¢ While logged into your Amazon account, go to the Contact us page.
‚Ä¢ Choose your issue, then at the bottom, select I need more help.
‚Ä¢ On the left, choose Request call now.
‚Ä¢ Enter your phone number, and you‚Äôll see an estimated time before you receive the call.

I‚Äôve never waited more than three minutes for a phone call. Be sure to have the order number handy.

Amazon Prime is expensive. You should get all you can out of that monthly or annual charge.

Question: ""I'm fed up with scrolling through so much stuff I don't care about to get to a recipe on a website. Any tricks to get right to what I want?""

So annoying, right? You found a tasty-looking recipe online, but when you open the page, you need to scroll way down to get to the recipe. To skip the story and jump straight to the steps, there's a fantastic app and website called Just The Recipe.

Paste that recipe‚Äôs URL into the blank field at justtherecipe.com, and it‚Äôll give you the ingredients and steps you need. And if you use the app, you can save your favorite recipes to a personal cookbook.

Another terrific way to skip to the recipe: On a PC, hit Control+F and type ""Print"" to quickly find the recipe. On a Mac, it‚Äôs Command+F.

4. Wait, can someone hack my printer?

Question: ""I heard printers can be hacked. Is this true? How do I know?""

You‚Äôve installed antivirus software and use unique passwords of 21 characters for all your accounts. Way to go! But it‚Äôs easy to forget about this vulnerable office item.

Just like your computer, your printer is a goldmine for hackers. Printers often store copies of the docs that have been printed. Any cybercriminal could get copies of sensitive information, like your financial records.

Here are three signs your printer has been hacked:
‚Ä¢ Your printer starts printing blank pages or a bunch of characters.
‚Ä¢ You notice print jobs that you did not initiate.
‚Ä¢ Your printer‚Äôs settings were changed without your knowledge.

Don‚Äôt panic! All you need to do is reset the printer to factory defaults:
‚Ä¢ Unplug the printer and press and hold the printer‚Äôs Reset button. (It‚Äôs usually on the back or bottom of the printer.)
‚Ä¢ While holding the Reset button, plug the printer back in, turn it on, and in about 20 seconds, lights will flash to indicate it‚Äôs done.

Fun fact: Your printer probably has an email address. Here‚Äôs how to find it.

5. There‚Äôs so much private stuff on my phone

Question: ""I'm selling my phone after I upgrade to a new one. How do I know everything is wiped properly before someone else has it? Is a factory reset enough?""

Your phone contains sensitive data, including your credit card numbers, bank account details, passwords, and private pics. You don‚Äôt want that info falling into the wrong hands. Just hitting delete or doing a factory reset won't cut it because advanced data recovery software that can still pry into deleted files.

To truly erase your phone, you need to do a factory reset and follow it up with a thorough data erase. This involves using specialized software that overwrites the phone's storage with random data multiple times, making it almost impossible for anyone to retrieve what you had on the phone.

Administration officials say China has increasingly blurred the lines between its military and civilian industries, prompting the United States to place restrictions on doing business with Chinese companies that may feed into Beijing‚Äö√Ñ√¥s military ambitions at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions, especially over Taiwan. 

In October, the administration announced sweeping limits on semiconductor exports to China, both from companies within the United States and in other countries that use US technology to make those products. 

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department said the actions demonstrated that the United States would defend its national security but also stood ready to work in cooperation with companies and host governments to ensure compliance with US export controls.","The Biden administration on Thursday stepped up its efforts to impede China‚Äö√Ñ√¥s development of advanced semiconductors, restricting another 36 companies and organizations from getting access to US technology.",AAPL,Technology & Communications,Hardware,Apple Inc.,2023-04-13T14:47:33+00:00,2023-04-13,2023-04-13T14:47:33+00:00,"[{'name': 'Politics'}, {'name': 'Tech'}]","WASHINGTON, April 13 (Reuters) - Google argued Thursday that the U.S. Justice Department's allegations that it broke antitrust law to build and maintain its dominance of search are flawed and that its lawsuit should be thrown out.

The government, which filed its lawsuit in the waning days of the Trump administration, has argued that Alphabet's Google acts illegally in paying billions of dollars each year to smartphone makers like Apple, LG, Motorola and Samsung, carriers like Verizon and browsers like Mozilla to be the default search for their customers.

Judge Amit Mehta actively questioned Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein. Mehta pressed him, for example, on if being dominant in search means that Google's search engine will improve faster than its competitors. He also asked if the deals were ""anticompetitive"" and gave the company an advantage.

Google's Schmidtlein replied: ""Offering a superior product, winning business on the merits is never unlawful.""

""There is zero consumer harm here whatsoever,"" Schmidtlein told the judge at another point.

Google has argued in court filings that the payments at issue are legal revenue-sharing deals and not illegal efforts to exclude rivals.

The decision on summary judgment will be decided by Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case is slated for trial in September.

Google's motion is the Internet company's latest attempt to end several costly and time-consuming lawsuits from state and federal governments aimed at reining in its market power.

The Justice Department sued Google in 2020, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech since it sued Microsoft Corp for anti-competitive practices in 1998. A settlement left the company intact although the decision to rein in Microsoft left room for Google, which was founded in 1998, and others to thrive.

Since this lawsuit was filed, Google has been hit with other antitrust complaints. The Justice Department filed a second lawsuit in January accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business.

A group of states led by Texas also sued on ad tech in 2020 while states led by Utah filed a lawsuit in 2021 saying the company broke antitrust law in handling its play store.","Google asks judge to toss U.S. antitrust lawsuit, says a 'superior product' is not unlawful",non-causal,LG,"['A', 'US']",['US'],['LG'],"['A', 'LG', 'AAPL', 'US']",0.16750956

            Shares of Alphabet slid during premarket trading in New York on Monday following a New York Times report on Sunday that revealed South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung was considering replacing Google with Microsoft's Bing as the default search engine on its devices. 

NYT said Google's employees were ""shocked"" when they heard about the news in March. Internal memos obtained by the newspaper reveal Google has been in ""panic"" mode because if Samsung were to switch search engines on its devices to Bing, that would cost them $3 billion in annual revenues. Google also has about $20 billion at stake in Apple contracts up for renewal this year. 



Microsoft turbocharged Bing by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, transforming the search engine into something capable of carrying on a conversation. This new type of search engine is one of the most serious threats to Google's search business empire. As a result, Google has been racing to build an all-new search engine powered by AI. NYT said internal documents show Google is upgrading the existing search engine with AI. 


The Samsung threat represented the first potential crack in Google's seemingly impregnable search business, which was worth $162 billion last year. Although it was not clear whether Microsoft's work with AI was the main reason Samsung was considering a change after the last 12 years, that was the assumption inside Google. The contract is under negotiation, and Samsung could stick with Google.

But the idea that Samsung, which makes hundreds of millions of smartphones with Google's Android software every year, would even consider switching search engines shocked Google's employees. -NYT 


As a result of the report, Alphabet shares slid as much as 3%, while Microsoft was up around 1.5%.



So now Google is scrambling to compete with Microsoft's Bing after ChatGPT integration. Did Google get lazy because they thought their search empire was impenetrable?

Until around 1 p.m. ET this afternoon, a search for the word ""Jew"" on Google had the engine telling users that the word is an offensive verb.

The top definition that appeared in search results described the word Jew as to ""bargain with someone in a miserly or petty way,"" with the origin being ""in reference to old stereotypes associating Jewish people with trading and moneylending.""

The Simon Wiesenthal Center, in a statement to Fox News Digital, said ""This does not appear to be an error but a manipulation to present anti-Semitic definition as main use of word.""

""Google owes explanation of who did this and why,"" it added.

When asked by Fox News Digital about the matter, Google flagged a tweet by Danny Sullivan, its public liaison for Search, giving its explanation of what happened.

""Our apologies. Google licenses definitions from third-party dictionary experts,"" the tweet said. ""We only display offensive definitions by default if they are the main meaning of a term. As this is not the case here, we have blocked this & passed along feedback to the partner for further review.""

The ordering of the definitions also has been drawing criticism on Twitter.

Andrea Vazzana, a child psychologist who specializes in the treatment of eating disorders in children, adolescents and adults at NYU Langone, said the negative influence of social media is largely owed to the amount of social comparisons that are part of engaging in these social media platforms.

Increased use of social media has also contributed, in part, to the shifting demographics of those affected by eating disorders, according to Vazzana. She said there has been an increase in younger individuals, including tweens as young as 9 and 10 years old, suffering from eating disorders.

‚ÄúThis may be correlational data, but we‚Äôre seeing people joining social media platforms at an earlier age as well,"" she told ABC News.

Vazzana noted that in addition to showing overedited, filtered photos, social media sites also offer users ways to find content like weight loss challenges, videos of purging techniques and unhealthy diets.

A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit organization, found that within 30 minutes of a 13-year-old joining TikTok, the teen was being recommended content tied to eating disorders.

Nearly 10% of the world‚Äôs population and an estimated 30 million people in the United States are affected by an eating disorder, according to a report from the Academy for Eating Disorders and Deloitte Access Economics.

The National Institute of Mental Health defines eating disorders as serious illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person‚Äôs eating behaviors.

During National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, now through March 5, health professionals and recovery advocates are raising awareness about the importance of social media literacy to combat eating disorders.

Vazzana suggests parents and teens have conversations about social media literacy: comparisons, the use of filters and Photoshop and the concept of a highlight reel.

She believes ‚Äúfriending‚Äù people on social media that you know in real life, instead of following influencers and strangers, may be a protective factor in combating poor self-esteem from comparison. Limiting time on social media, as multiple studies have highlighted, can also be beneficial for both mental health and weight esteem.

When it comes to allowing children on social media, Vazzana said age is an important factor for parents to consider as research demonstrates that girls who engage on social media earlier than their peers have a higher drive for thinness.

In January, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said he believes 13 is too young for children to be on social media platforms, despite some of the most popular platforms allowing users to be that age.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, requires users to be at least 13 years old to use its platforms, according to the company's website.

TikTok and Snapchat each also require users to be at least 13-years-old, according to their respective websites.

Google, the parent company of YouTube, does not allow kids under age 13 to create their own Google Account. YouTube allows parents to set up a ""supervised account"" for a child under age 13, for which they can control the content settings, according to its website.

In most cases, the social media sites require people to enter their birth dates in order to sign up as users.

Sam Dylan Finch, a recovery advocate, told ABC News that while social media can be a powerful tool in eating disorder recovery -- including his own -- it can also trap users in cycles of comparison and self-critique.

‚ÄúIt can be a vehicle for fad diets, health misinformation, harsh criticism, especially for those of us that don‚Äôt conform to society‚Äôs ideals of beauty and achievement,"" he said. ""And perpetuates standards of perfection that are impossible to achieve.""

Dylan Finch added that he believes how you curate your social media feed is important, in order to rule out false promises of esteem that the diet culture tries to sell, often through sponsored posts.

‚ÄúThis makes curating our feeds a powerful act of self-care that every one of us should take seriously,"" he said.

Some social media sites have started to provide in-app resources for eating disorders and raise awareness.

In 2020, TikTok partnered with the National Eating Disorder Association, telling ABC News at the time, ""At TikTok we work to foster an inclusive, body-positive environment where people can find support, affirmation and empathy within their community. Our goal is to create a space where our community feels comfortable and confident to be exactly who they are and express themselves freely.""

Instagram also has protections for kids, including support for people struggling with body image issues, age verification, parental controls, decreasing visibility of content that is potentially sensitive, time control settings, default settings to provide more privacy, as well as in-app resources offering mental health support, a spokesperson told ABC News last year.

When preoccupations with eating, exercise and photographs for social media start to distract a child from what is happening in real life, Vazzana suggests seeking professional help.

She said that pushing back against appearance ideals allows for more meaningful engagement in the real world, saying, ""It‚Äôs almost like a bit of obstinance that can be used in a healthy way.‚Äù

The DOJ has spent three years preparing to take Google to court since it first accused Google of illegally eliminating competitors by paying billions of dollars each year to smartphone makers including Apple and Samsung to make its search engine is pre-loaded as the default onto their web browsers.

In the suit, filed in 2020 in Washington D.C., federal court, the DOJ claims that Google has long broken then law in its quest to remain ‚Äúthe gateway to the internet‚Äù ‚Äî illegally gaining a leg up on competitors such as Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo.

In response, Google has argued that its deals with phone makers including Apple ‚Äî which reportedly has taken as much as $15 billion a year in payments from Google ‚Äî were not exclusive, as consumers were free to alter the default settings on their devices.

The epic trial ‚Äî the first major US monopoly trial of the modern internet age ‚Äî is anticipated to last 10 weeks starting on Tuesday. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as well as top executives from Apple and other tech companies, are expected to take the witness stand, according to The New York Times.

Collectively, the DOJ and Google have already collectively deposed more than 150 individuals for the case, and have produced more than five million pages of documents.

In its lawsuit, the Justice Department described Google in the late 1990s and early 2000s as ‚Äúthe darling of Silicon Valley as a scrappy start-up with an innovative way to search the emerging internet.‚Äù

The Justice Department has asked that Google change its allegedly unlawful business practices, potentially pay damages and restructure its businesses.

There won‚Äôt be a jury. Rather, President Barack Obama-appointed Judge Amit P. Mehta will be presiding over the case and will issue the final ruling.

Representatives for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to The Post‚Äôs request for comment.

The Post has also sought comment from the DOJ‚Äôs litigator, Kenneth Dintzer, and Google‚Äôs counsel, John Schmidtlein, a partner at Williams & Connolly.

Kent Walker, Google‚Äôs president of global affairs told The Post: ‚ÄúThis is a backwards-looking case at a time of unprecedented innovation, including breakthroughs in AI, new apps and new services, all of which are creating more competition and more options for people than ever before.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt use Google because they have to ‚Äî they use it because they want to. It‚Äôs easy to switch your default search engine ‚Äî we‚Äôre long past the era of dial-up internet and CD-ROMs. Our success is hard fought, and the result of our focus on building services that help Americans every day. We look forward to making our case in court,‚Äù Walker added.

Even before the trial has kicked off, legal teams on both sides have been aggressive in making their cases, with Google most recently arguing in a court filing that the Justice Department‚Äôs head of antitrust, Jonathan Kanter, has a ‚Äúdeep-seated bias‚Äù against the company.

In the court documents, Google reiterated its long-held stance that Kanter‚Äôs past work for Google rivals such as Microsoft, Yelp and New York Post parent News Corp. represents a conflict of interest ‚Äî asserting that he received ‚Äúmillions of dollars‚Äù in private practice to push for antitrust action.

The company further alleged that Kanter ‚Äúis using public office to accomplish what he was unable to do in private practice on behalf of his paying clients.‚Äù

The DOJ, meanwhile, argued that Google filed ‚Äúunusual, invasive and irrelevant discovery requests‚Äù related to Kanter‚Äôs involvement in the case. The feds also asked the judge to stop Google from arguing it has engaged in selective enforcement of antitrust laws.

Mehta has already struck down parts of the federal monopoly trial earlier this month in a win for Google, dismissing four counts that were included in the lawsuit after determining that government attorneys had failed to show the company damaged rivals like Yelp and Expedia with its online search practices.

Mehta ruled that the states‚Äô allegation pertaining to search results ‚Äúrelies not on evidence but almost entirely on the opinion and speculation of its expert.‚Äù

‚ÄúSimply put, there is no record evidence of anticompetitive harm,‚Äù the judge wrote.

Google‚Äôs famed search engine was created by Sergey Brin and Larry Page when the two were close friends as Ph.D students at Stanford University in the 1990s.

After growing into a multibillion-dollar success, Google was restructured into Alphabet in 2015, with Alphabet becoming the parent company of the search engine and its several other subsidiaries.

Brin served as the Alphabet‚Äôs first president while Page assumed the role of chief executive.

Corporate borrowers will have to pay more of that debt back as refinancing grows more difficult with rising interest rates. The persistent squeeze from inflation is keeping costs high for many companies while stifling consumer demand and sapping purchasing power.

Corporate debt rose from roughly $16.3 trillion just before the pandemic hit to about $19.8 trillion near the end of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve. Economists and analysts expect some kind of recession to hit the U.S. economy in 2023 and the severity of it could weigh heavily on both large and small companies as they repay debt.

‚ÄúFaced with an overhang of pandemic-era debt that begins to mature in 2025, companies will be looking for refinancing opportunities,‚Äù S&P Global Ratings said.

Refinancing risks are increasing partly because of the potential for a recession. Credit rating trends are already turning negative, with more downgrades than upgrades on debt since August. It all adds up to default risks rising as companies get pinched by a weakening economy and have a difficult time refinancing existing debt.

The Federal Reserve has sharply raised its benchmark interest rate in an effort to tame inflation, but that has made borrowing more expensive. The rate is currently in a range of 4.50% to 4.75% after starting last year at basically zero. The widespread expectation is now for the Fed to increase the rate to at least 5.25% by June and some bets on Wall Street are calling for a rate of up to 5.50%.

The tougher financing atmosphere is running up against an economic slowdown. Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet, Dell and other big technology companies have been cutting staff in an effort to control costs as demand wanes. Retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, have been issuing warnings about weaker consumer spending.

‚ÄúMany companies will find it more difficult to balance still-elevated input costs and waning demand amid the prospects of a downturn in the world‚Äôs largest economy,‚Äù S&P Global Ratings said.

The broader labor market has remained relatively strong, but a downturn in employment could further weaken consumer spending and hit corporate earnings.

They‚Äôre being developed under the codename ‚ÄúMagi.‚Äù

The plans are part of Google‚Äôs efforts to meet the threat posed by new systems like Microsoft‚Äôs Bing chatbot and OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Many think these chatbots could one day replace traditional search engines like Google ‚Äî despite their failings.

According to the NYT, Google‚Äôs position is so threatened that Samsung is considering replacing Google with Bing as the default search engine on its mobile devices.

‚ÄúThat kind of behavior is counterintuitive to everything that the military stands for,‚Äù said Alden Mills, an author and three-time Navy SEAL platoon commander. Mills now gives keynote speeches and advises CEOs and company board members on subjects like teamwork and leadership.

But not every veteran leaves the military and settles into their forever career right away. Take Hemanth ‚ÄúRay‚Äù Nalamothu, 33, for example. The Queens native served as an Army paratrooper in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Jordan from 2011 to 2018.

Upon leaving active service, he landed a prestigious job as the assistant to the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. But, after two years, Nalamothu decided a different path might be better. When he approached Amazon, which employs more than 45,000 military veterans and spouses, the company scooped him up.

‚ÄúThe leadership principles, unique perspectives in problem solving and ability to deliver results make [veterans] highly desirable recruits,‚Äù said Beau Higgins, a senior manager of military talent acquisition at Amazon. ‚ÄúThey also have a bias for action, one of our guiding principles.‚Äù

Nalamothu was assigned to Amazon‚Äôs JFK8, where he ran one of the largest fulfillment engines on Earth, all during the height of the global pandemic. He got the job done.

More recently, Nalamothu joined the 10-month Amazon technical apprenticeship, securing a full-time role as an associate cloud consultant at Amazon web services. He‚Äôll take that on when he completes his rotation as the chief of operations for the United States Army Corps of Engineers at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn.

While veterans have always had plenty to offer to employers, their experience and know-how is especially needed in uncertain times, said experts. ‚ÄúVeterans are not only diverse as a population, but they also bring with them a diversity of thought,‚Äù said Higgins. ‚ÄúThey just look at problems differently and are really good problem-solvers.‚Äù

Mills credits veterans‚Äô decision-making abilities for helping them stand out from the crowd. ‚ÄúAt a very young age, veterans are instilled with great responsibility and decision-making,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey learn to use what they have or become very resourceful in finding things they need to accomplish the mission/job.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs not just what vets bring to the workforce that matters ‚Äî it‚Äôs how they transform it as well.

‚ÄúThe entire US military is based on teamwork,‚Äù said Mills. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have a can-do, team-oriented mindset, you will not succeed. As a soldier, sailor, airman or marine, that can-do attitude can be infectious in any organization. Couple that mindset with their focus on looking on teamwork, and you will find veterans are a force multiplier in your workforce.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt have to tell that to corporate leaders like 38-year-old John Perez. He decided to join the military after he saw the World Trade towers come down just miles from his home in North Arlington, NJ. He was in high school at the time.

Perez joined the US Army shortly after, first via the Reserve Officers‚Äô Training Corps program at Seton Hall University in South Orange, NJ. He found a way to cram four years of college into three. Upon graduation, Perez was deployed to Iraq twice in four years before spending two years in the Army Reserves as a captain.

Perez has since climbed the ranks at Johnson & Johnson over the past 10 years, initially leveraging his experience in logistics. He now heads the department of military and veteran affairs, helping members of the military shift into the private sector.

‚ÄúThe military provides experience that you just can‚Äôt get in the private sector ‚Äî open ears, open eyes, coordinating and collaborating by default,‚Äù said Perez. These qualities are prized at Johnson & Johnson, where the executive chairman and most recent CEO, Alex Gorsky, is also an Army veteran.

Tamara ‚ÄúTam‚Äù Sonon, 42, a CUNY graduate, is a new recruit at Johnson & Johnson. She spent more than 20 years in the Navy, doing everything from managing finances and serving as an advisor to the United Nations in Mali to managing supply chains throughout the Pacific as well as Australia, Croatia and Egypt.

‚ÄúI loved every minute of my time in the Navy,‚Äù said Sonon. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt plan to stay long at first.‚Äù But as time went on, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd leave before I became an admiral.‚Äù

Yet with her husband also in the service and two young children, parental responsibilities prevailed. Even so, she finds her experience in the Navy to be of great use as the marketing lead for gastroenterology at Johnson & Johnson, a position she‚Äôs held for more than a year.

This transition is, in part, thanks to the GI Bill. ‚ÄúThe current military has a higher level of education than the current population,‚Äù said Perez. In fact, post-secondary education isn‚Äôt an anomaly among veterans.

‚ÄúThis is the most educated military in the history of the world,‚Äù said Mike Sarraille, the founder and CEO of management consulting and executive search firm Talent War Group. He spent two decades as a Recon Marine and Navy SEAL lieutenant commander in the elite Joint Special Operations Command.

Sarraille joined the military when the war on terror was raging in 2001. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt leave until I finished my job,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt ended up taking me 20 years, but in the military, we understand that our job is to make this place better than we found it, and if you‚Äôre working and doing the bare minimum, that can‚Äôt happen.‚Äù","If you want a job done well, hire a veteran",non-causal,"GI, US, NJ, CEO, SEAL, CUNY",['BHRRC'],[],"['NJ', 'CUNY', 'GI', 'CEO', 'SEAL', 'US']","['NJ', 'BHRRC', 'SLB', 'CUNY', 'GI', 'CEO', 'SEAL', 'US']",-0.99994075

            AT&T is preparing to close its flagship store in downtown San Francisco, citing 'changing consumer shopping habits,' according to local news website SFGATE.

""Consumer shopping habits continue to change, and we're changing with them. That means serving customers where they are through the right mix of retail stores, digital channels, and our phone-based care team,"" said AT&T spokesperson Chris Collins. He said the store at 1 Powell St. will close on Aug. 1.



AT&T will have eleven remaining stores in the metro area, including one on Market and Fremont streets. So not a total exodus. 

Last month, T-Mobile closed its flagship store in the downtown area. It told SFGATE, ""We recently reshaped our retail strategy."" 

The main reason why AT&T, T-Mobile, and many other stores, such as Office Depot, The Container Store, Anthropologie, Whole Foods, Disney Store, Armani Exchange, CB2, Saks Off 5th, and others, are closing up shop is that progressive city leadership failed to enforce law and order, sparking a tsunami theft wave. 

A combination of remote work, companies scaling back office footprints, and no one wanting to have operations based in a Marxist shit (covered) city have forced some of the highest office vacancy rates in the country. The local economy can't thrive without office workers, a doom loop that crushes retailers. 

As retailers leave because of a lack of sales and theft, this hits building owners who can't find tenants, forcing some to default on the buildings (see: here). You can see the chain of events is creating a perfect storm. 

Earlier this week, Westfield and its partner Brookfield Properties stopped making payments on the metro area's largest shopping mall after ""challenging operating conditions."" 


Wow, ABC actually admitted San Francisco is falling apart due to rampant crime and drug use.

This comes after Nordstrom, which occupies 312,000 square feet in the mall at 865 Market St, isn't renewing its lease in August after nearly four decades of operations. When Nordstrom closes, the mall only be 55% leased, well below the average 93% of other Westfield malls across the US. 

Bloomberg obtained a letter to employees from Jamie Nordstrom, the retailer's chief stores officer, who said the closing of Nordstrom is due to a slump in sales because of lower foot traffic, adding ""dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years."" We suspect Nordstrom is referring to the out-of-control crime.

And on Thursday, Cinemark Theater announced it would be closing its location at the mall. 

Can you see how failed progressive policies have sparked a vicious doom loop, forcing businesses to shut down and subsequently putting pressure on property owners? In these high-interest-rate environments, these owners struggle to find financing and tenants, leaving some with no alternative but to default.

What a mess the Democrats have created.

Yet some cybersecurity experts are demanding more reforms that permanently end data harvesting and retention across the digital app space.

On Wednesday, Flo, a period tracker app that‚Äôs used by about 200 million users worldwide, announced it now has an Anonymous Mode that lets users access the app without requiring a name, email address or other technical identifiers from being associated with their health data.

The new feature was inspired by the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade ‚Äî a nearly 50-year precedent that affirmed abortion access as a constitutional right ‚Äî and since, at least 12 states have banned abortion or heavily restricted the procedure.

Digital privacy advocates have warned about how law enforcement or anti-abortion groups could seek out user‚Äôs digital data in order to enforce those abortion bans.

America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.

That‚Äôs because many period tracking apps, including Flo, allow users to input their menstrual cycles, sexual activity and ovulation windows. That information could potentially be used to identify individuals seeking abortions.

Andrew Crawford, senior policy council at Center for Democracy & Technology, believes Flo‚Äôs Anonymous Mode is a positive step in the right direction. He told Changing America that, ‚Äúreducing the amount of data that companies collect and retain can really reduce the risk of people‚Äôs reproductive health data being used and shared in unwanted and harmful ways.‚Äù

There are still more reforms needed, as Crawford explained law enforcement entities, including from states that have passed abortion bans and restrictions, can still go to companies and demand data they have on users ‚Äî some of which may include sensitive health information.

It‚Äôs a situation that recently played out in Nebraska when Meta‚Äôs Facebook turned over chat messages of a mother who is accused of giving abortion pills to her daughter and then helping bury the fetus. Those actions would be in violation of Nebraska law that bans abortion 20 weeks after an egg is fertilized.

Facebook Messenger offers end-to-end encryption, which means chats between users are only visible on those users‚Äô phones and aren‚Äôt readable by Facebook or any government entity that requests to see it ‚Äî but end-to-end encryption is not an automated feature and Facebook users must select the option to mark chats as secret.

There‚Äôs currently no federal law preventing companies from collecting and selling user data and a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that more regulations are needed to manage how companies collect, use and sell online personal information ‚Äî often done with a consumer‚Äôs knowledge or consent.

Most reproductive health apps have weak privacy protections, with the Mozilla Foundation investigating 25 popular reproductive health apps and wearable devices and found 18 offered dangerously vague privacy labels that also could carry security concerns.

However, Crawford says there are proactive measures companies can take, like limiting the amount of unnecessary information collected on users and in instances where it is collected, it‚Äôs deleted quickly.

Google announced such a policy in July by saying if its systems identified a user was visiting a sensitive location ‚Äî like an abortion clinic ‚Äî it would delete those entries from its Location History feature soon after the visit.

Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director for Fight for the Future, agreed, telling Changing America in an emailed statement, ‚ÄúWe need companies to collect and retain less data from the get-go, and to make ‚ÄòAnonymous Mode‚Äô the default so that no one has to be afraid of who might gain access to their information.‚Äù

When considering a mobile app or any digital program, Crawford recommends users should take a close look at their privacy policies, which can be dense and hard to find but critically important. Users should also be considering whether an app tracks location data, has access to photos and microphones and whether messages have end-to-end encryption.

In addition to its Anonymous Mode, Flo confirmed it uses encryption technology on all of its data and passcode protection to reduce the risk of any unauthorized users from accessing the app on their personal devices. Anonymous Mode will offer a deeper layer of privacy, with the app partnering with Cloudflare to remove the connection between a user‚Äôs IP address and their health data.",How reproductive health apps are strengthening privacy but still pose serious risks,non-causal,"GAO, IP",[],['AP'],"['IP', 'GAO']","['D', 'AP', 'IP', 'GAO']",-0.997799

Why is Microsoft removing its Internet Explorer browser?

Internet Explorer has been around for 27 years, and when it first came out, people were all about it. However, more advanced browsers have been introduced since then, and to put it simply, Internet Explorer just can't keep up anymore.

With its performance and security issues becoming a more consistent nightmare for Microsoft, the company has decided to fully switch to its Microsoft Edge browser, which is available for Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS, iOS and Android.

MICROSOFT IMPOSES LIMITS ON BING CHATBOT AFTER MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR

Microsoft Edge is designed to be faster, more secure and more compatible with modern web standards than Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer will no longer be available on any Microsoft device. As a result, Microsoft is sending a software update to users of Internet Explorer 11 that will permanently disable the browser on any Windows computer that still has it installed.

What browsers can I use instead?

As mentioned before, Microsoft is fully pushing its users to use Microsoft Edge, which is a pretty reputable browser. Although, there are plenty of alternatives for you to use as well if you do not wish to use Microsoft Edge. Here's a list of four alternatives.

Chrome is one of the best browsers out there with an endless library of resources and knowledge. It is also convenient because you can log in to your Google account if you have one and have your Chrome be a little more personalized with autofill and sync features.

Mozilla Firefox is another great web browser to use. It can block notification pop-ups, alert you when your email has been involved in a data breach, and is super customizable so you can make your browsing experience more personal to you.

HOW HACKERS FIND OUT IF YOU'RE A HIGH-VALUE TARGET BEFORE STEALING

Safari is a web browser developed by Apple for Apple devices. It is easy to use, works superfast and has some of the best privacy features of any web browser in the game. Plus, it has great syncing features to make your browsing experience easier for you.

While Opera is not as well-known, it is widely adopted because of its superfast performance and ability to use add-ons from the Chrome library. It also has a built-in ad blocker and VPN, as well as in-browser messaging.

Brave is quickly picking up steam and proving to be an excellent browser for all. It will automatically block ads and other online trackers. It also works superfast, allows you to customize your privacy controls, has a free video conference tool built within it.

Malware can steal sensitive data, such as banking credentials, and it can infect through many ways - for instance, by downloading apps from unknown sources or opening attachments from unsolicited emails.

If malware is installed, it may significantly decline device performance, allow unauthorised access to the device's system and data, and install unauthorised applications.

To keep one's devices safe, the joint advisory issued on Tuesday (11 April) advised the public to be careful when downloading suspicious Android/Chrome/Google-related updates or any dubious Android Package Kit (APK) files onto their mobile devices, as these files are not official files released by Google.

Some of these dubious files may even come with seemingly genuine naming conventions, such as the following:

To keep devices safe from malware, it is important to only download and install apps from official app stores like Google Play Store for Android.

Before downloading, check the developer info, number of downloads, and user reviews to make sure it is legitimate. Be cautious when clicking on ads within apps, and do not grant permission to pop-ups that request access to your device's hardware or data.

Make sure the device has updated anti-virus/anti-malware apps that can detect and remove malware, and that the operating system and apps are updated regularly with the latest security patches.

If you suspect that your device may be infected with malware, turn on ""flight mode"" and perform an anti-virus/anti-malware scan.

And if you find any unknown apps, uninstall them immediately, contact the manufacturer for assistance, or reformat the device to factory default if it still shows signs of infection. Before reformatting, back up your device data on an external storage device.

To find out more about mobile malware and preventive steps to keep your mobile devices safe and secure, you can refer to the CSA‚Äô SingCERT advisory.

Duncan McCann, a staff member at child advocacy group 5Rights, filed the AADC complaint with the Information Commissioner‚Äôs office (ICO), asking the data watchdog to order Google to stop collecting children‚Äôs data and potentially fine it as much as 4% of annual turnover.

‚ÄúImagine YouTube as an adult stranger following your child ‚Äòonline‚Äô with a virtual clipboard recording everything they do,‚Äù McCann said in a statement. ‚ÄúThat is what is happening every day and they are not just doing it with your child. They are doing it with up to 5 million other UK children as well, resulting in an enormous amount of personal information being gathered.

‚ÄúNever mind it being against the law, it is a massive, unlicensed, social experiment on our children with uncertain consequences. YouTube should change the design of their platform and delete the data they have been gathering unlawfully from under 13s.‚Äù

Although YouTube officially bans children under 13 from using its main website, McCann‚Äôs complaint alleges the company has failed to ensure that younger children are following the rules and only using the main platform with parental consent.

A separate app, YouTube Kids, is available for children under 13 and has much stricter data processing, but data from the telecoms watchdog Ofcom shows that while YouTube, including YouTube Kids, was used by 89% of children between three and 17, only 40% of YouTube users aged three to four exclusively used the Kids app, with the proportion falling even lower for older children.

Beeban Kidron, the filmmaker and crossbench peer who founded 5Rights and pushed for the creation of the AADC, said she supported McCann‚Äôs complaint. ‚ÄúIt is well established that data privacy regimes are central to the safety of children online.

‚ÄúData law is not a pick and mix of what elements companies want to adhere to, it is a holistic approach that requires companies to offer children the highest degree of data privacy and in doing so lessen their exposure to harmful experiences and exploitation online.‚Äù

As well as asking for the data collected from children to be destroyed, the complaint also asks for the ICO to consider ordering the rollback or deletion of any machine learning system that has been trained on the gathered data.

A YouTube spokesperson said: ‚ÄúOver the years, we‚Äôve made investments to protect kids and families, such as launching a dedicated kids app, introducing new data practices for children‚Äôs content, and providing more age-appropriate experiences.

‚ÄúBuilding on that long-standing approach and following the additional guidance provided by the code, we implemented further measures to bolster children‚Äôs privacy on YouTube, such as more protective default settings and a dedicated YouTube Supervised Experience.

‚ÄúWe remain committed to continuing our engagement with the ICO on this priority work, and with other key stakeholders including children, parents and child protection experts.‚Äù

The AADC, also known as the ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Code‚Äù, has been internationally influential. After it came into force in the UK at the end of summer 2021, technology platforms including Instagram, TikTok and Snap all announced new policies to child users of their apps.

Previous reports suggest collaboration with Samsung brings Google about $3bn annually from the partnership, and experts have warned that AI-enabled Bing could be Microsoft‚Äôs biggest-ever play to take on the search engine giant.

Microsoft had said the new Bing system is based on the same technology underpinning the now famous ChatGPT chatbot, adding that it would serve as an ‚ÄúAI copilot‚Äù.

‚ÄúAI will fundamentally change every software category, starting with the largest category of all: search,‚Äù Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a press event in February.

However, the Bing AI system also faced criticism in February for making factual errors as it answered questions and for sending odd messages to its users as well aso hurling insults.

‚ÄúWhy do you act like a liar, a cheater, a manipulator, a bully, a sadist, a sociopath, a psychopath, a monster, a demon, a devil?‚Äù it asked one user who tried to manipulate the system.

Following the breakdown, Microsoft proceeded to limit the number of interactions people could have with the new Bing system.

The company said it ‚Äúwill explore expanding the caps on chat sessions to further enhance search and discovery experiences‚Äù.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing are designed to gather information from the internet and present them to users with a sometimes new, sometimes old human-like output.

Shares of Microsoft were up about 1%.

Google pays billions of dollars every year to phone manufacturers, including a reported $20 billion annually to Apple, to serve as the default search engine. In return, the search company reaps billions of dollars worth of advertising, which has long been a profit center for Google.

Samsung and Google's deal is up for renewal soon, the Times reported, and is worth an estimated $3 billion in revenue to Google. Samsung is a major Android manufacturer, and the news that Samsung would consider a switch reportedly surprised Google employees.

""Wow, OK, that's wild,"" one Google worker reportedly responded to the news.

Google has more than a 90% share of the search market, according to StatCounter, and is in the middle of a contentious battle with the Department of Justice over its search dominance. The DOJ has fixated on Google's apparent pay-to-play model, noting that paying to maintain default status has ""harmful effects on competition and consumers.""

Microsoft's Bing has languished for years behind Google. But Bing saw a surge of interest with the launch of its AI chatbot, which relies on OpenAI's GPT model. CNBC previously reported on how the launch of both Bing Chat and OpenAI's ChatGPT spurred Google into an all-hands ""code red"" response.

Samsung and Microsoft have an established partnership. Microsoft's Office apps are preloaded on Samsung phones, for example, and Samsung phones have built-in software that makes it easier to connect them to Windows computers.

It isn't clear if Microsoft would be willing to pay the same price that Google would. Microsoft relies far less on search and advertising and derives a significant amount of its revenue from cloud and enterprise solutions.

Samsung's reported reassessment may be a moot point, however, as Google looks to integrate Bard into search as soon as the fall.

But while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella seems to be in the lead following its major investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, other companies may be playing the long game.

In the course of a few months, artificial intelligence has catapulted from the realm of research labs into the public domain. ChatGPT arrived in November and last month hit 100 million users, while Google and Microsoft have made a flurry of product announcements in recent weeks and are expected to launch their own A.I.-enhanced chatbots soon.

Nadella himself referred to the A.I. competition with Google as a ‚Äúrace‚Äù when he announced Microsoft‚Äôs A.I.-assisted version of its Bing search engine earlier this month. But with such a lucrative market on the line, don‚Äôt expect only two factions in the coming war.

‚ÄúThis is an A.I. arms race that‚Äôs happening,‚Äù senior tech analyst at Wedbush Dan Ives said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday. ‚ÄúObviously, this race is just starting.‚Äù

Ives said Microsoft is ‚Äútop of the mountain‚Äù at the moment when it comes to A.I. after the company‚Äôs $10 billion investment in OpenAI, but warned that most other major tech companies are working on their own A.I. game plans.

‚ÄúYou look at what‚Äôs happened: It‚Äôs a Game of Thrones battle between Microsoft and Google, and Apple that‚Äôs just quietly sitting there right now,‚Äù Ives said, adding that he expects Apple to make some ‚Äúsignificant A.I. announcements‚Äù as early as this summer.

While Google, Microsoft, and even Chinese search engine Baidu are battling it out for A.I. on the search engine front, Apple may be working on a different strategy. Ives predicted Apple will ‚Äúintegrate A.I. more into the App Store and more into the actual devices,‚Äù and expects the next generation of Apple iPhones to come equipped with greater A.I. capabilities.

Apple is unlikely to be involved in the A.I. search engine wars directly, as the company receives billions of dollars annually from Google to keep it as the default search engine on the iPhone, but could still be poised to benefit regardless of who wins between Google and Microsoft. Both companies could engage in a bidding war for their search engines to be placed on Apple devices if their A.I.-enhanced technology performs comparably.

Earlier this month, Nadella told The Verge that increasing Bing‚Äôs user base is Microsoft‚Äôs goal, as even marginal gains in search engine market share from Google could translate into billions in extra advertising revenue.

Amazon is another company likely evaluating the situation and the Google-Microsoft A.I. war, Ives said. Like Apple, the e-commerce giant is unlikely to be directly involved in A.I. applications for search engines, but the company has recently explored integrating generative A.I. similar to the technology powering ChatGPT with its web services division, Amazon‚Äôs on-demand cloud computing and API platform.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in an interview with the FT this week that the company is exploring ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù to partner with smaller A.I. startups competing with OpenAI, without elaborating on how A.I. would enhance its web services platform, which primarily sells to companies.

In his CNBC interview, Ives predicted Amazon would use A.I. to enhance its business and sales operations to other companies. ‚ÄúI could see them specifically navigating on the enterprise,‚Äù he said. This week, Amazon Web Services announced a new partnership with Sway AI, a startup focused on creating accessible A.I. applications for businesses.

What it all adds up to is an A.I. arms race that extends far beyond search engines, and Ives said interest in A.I. is unlikely to be a passing fad.

‚ÄúThis is just starting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt view this as a ‚Äòhype cycle.‚Äô This is real spending, and I think that‚Äôs the difference versus other, we‚Äôll call them hype cycles that we‚Äôve seen over the past few years.‚Äù

With Google‚Äôs generally poor search results nowadays, appending ‚Äúreddit‚Äù has long been the default way I search for almost anything (and no, I‚Äôm not ready to get my info from an AI chatbot, either). But given the sheer volume of subreddits that are currently unavailable ‚Äî including some of the most-subscribed subreddits ‚Äî clicking through many Reddit links in search results takes me to a message saying the subreddit is private.

And even if you don‚Äôt rely on the Reddit trick like I do, Reddit links often show up at the top of search results anyway, meaning that many people who don‚Äôt regularly use the platform have probably found some useful information on the site.

In Tears of the Kingdom, for example, I‚Äôm currently on the hunt for a specific piece of armor, but when I searched for tips about it last night, I found that r/TOTK is private.

I‚Äôve been meaning to find some new good music, but r/music and r/spotify went dark.

Sure, Google can provide me answers for any one of those needs. Other sites have great guides for Tears of the Kingdom. Google surfaced some potentially-useful videos for my pocket door problem (on YouTube, of course). And searching ‚Äúbest new music‚Äù brought up many lists I could look through.

But none of those have the conversational and community elements that makes Reddit so dang useful.

The First Eagle Global Fund (SGENX ), with almost $47 billion in assets under management, reflects the teachings and principles of economist and professor Benjamin Graham , the father of value investing, and Buffett, Graham's most famous disciple ‚Äî disciplined investing, ample liquidity and diversification. For almost three decades, starting in 1979, the fund was run by another acolyte of value, Jean-Marie Eveillard. Since 2008, the fund's been run by Matthew McLennan, with Kimball Brooker coming on board a year or two later. Since 1979, First Eagle Global has returned more than 12% annually, even including the 5% load fee charged on the first $25,000 invested. The current annual expense ratio is 1.11%. A $10,000 investment in the fund in 1979 was worth about $1.62 million at the end of 2022, excluding sales charges, more than three times the return of the MSCI World Index, First Eagle says . SGENX ALL mountain First Eagle Global price Graham and David Dodd, his fellow Columbia Business School professor, quite literally write the book on security analysis, Brooker said in an interview. ""They were the original value investors who really were focused on how not to lose money and we're focused on a means of systematically tilting the odds in the favor of their investors,"" adds the First Eagle co-manager. The fund beat the market during 2022's market turmoil with a 6% loss, and is up about 4% this year. How to find value? The fund employs three main elements when it comes to security selection within the universe of global value, Brooker said. It first insists on finding durable businesses, Brooker said. The concept is similar to searching for the so-called ""wide moat"" around a business that Buffett has called the single, ""most important"" factor in judging a company's competitive advantage. ""To us, survival and persistence is is really the the key question. That's kind of our view of quality,"" Brooker said. One example is Swiss elevator company Schindler Holding , which is as dominant in the industry as Otis Worldwide. Another name First Eagle considers a durable business is Richemont , a Swiss luxury goods holding company that makes Cartier jewelry, Brooker said. Another stock outside the U.S. that First Eagle holds is Jardine Matheson , a Hong Kong-based conglomerate whose origins date back to the 19th century, and whose businesses include Mandarin Oriental hotels. Margin of safety The second piece of the puzzle is to find stocks with a margin safety, Brooker said. The margin of safety principle, popularized by Graham, implies that an investor only purchases securities when they sell at a discount ‚Äî significantly below their intrinsic value. ""What is interesting is that this discount that international markets trade at relative to U.S. markets is very wide,"" Brooker said. The third element is to minimize risks stemming from management-related issues or unethical behavior, Brooker said. Brooker joined First Eagle in 2009 around the time when Eveillard stepped down. With a B.A. from Yale University and an MBA from Harvard, Brooker previously worked as the chief investment officer of Corsair Capital, a private equity firm spun off from JPMorgan. Big cash One notable characteristic of the fund is that it holds a significant amount of cash ‚Äî 7.5% of the portfolio right now. ""It's our default position. When we're not able to find things that make sense to us, that meet our underwriting criteria, we'll wait in cash,"" Brooker said. ""We don't want to force the money to be put to work into things that don't fit."" Buffett, too, is known for his preference to hold large amounts of cash, comparing it to oxygen. Berkshire's cash hoard grew to nearly $130 billion at the end of 2022. Buffett said in his recent annual shareholder letter that Berkshire will continue to hold a ""boatload"" of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with its myriad of businesses. Deep roots Within First Eagle Global's portfolio, which is half U.S. and half international stocks, there's a degree of overlap in a handful of companies that Berkshire Hathaway also owns, including American Express , Taiwan Semiconductor and Bank of New York Mellon . The fund has also owned shares in Berkshire itself for decades. ""It's probably not too surprising that like-minded investors often end up in in some of the same places,"" Brooker said. The connection to Berkshire doesn't end there. Eveillard, who served as First Eagle's senior advisor for years after surrendering day-to-day management, also taught at Columbia Business School's value investing program, where Buffett got an A+ from Ben Graham in 1951.

New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, dropped 0.37% last month from September, a 14th straight decline, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Wednesday. The existing-home market fared worse, down 0.47%, the steepest decline since 2014.

Before the rescue, China‚Äôs offshore property notes plummeted to record lows as defaults mounted to unprecedented levels. The rout had its roots in a crackdown that started in 2020 on excessive leverage at developers as well as speculation among homebuyers, and was worsened by Covid restrictions that exacerbated a slump in housing sales.

Agile, which develops villa apartments and high-rise homes set amid landscaped gardens, was among builders that met with one of China‚Äôs key bond-market regulators earlier this month about offering support to domestic note sales, the official Securities Times reported.

This is a serious problem that could result in you being targeted by criminals.

Crooks could target you with spammy ads to make money.

Or they could spy on you, steal your info, and then use it defraud you or take your money.

Watching out for the warning signs of malware is extremely important.

""If you're seeing some of these problems with Chrome, you might have unwanted software or malware installed on your computer,"" Google said.

There are five signs that you need to look out for.

The first is pop-up ads or new tabs that won't go away.

Second is if your Google Chrome homepage or search engine keeps changing without your permission.

The third is if unwanted Chrome extensions or toolbars keep coming back.

Fourth is that your browsing is hijacked, and keeps redirecting to unfamiliar pages or ads.

And fifth, you may see alerts about a virus or an infected device.

Thankfully there are some steps you can take to stop these problems.

The best option is the reset your browser settings, which should clear up many of Chrome's problems.

Launch Chrome then go to More > Settings in the top-right of the screen.

Then select Reset Settings > Restore Settings To Their Original Defaults > Reset Settings.

""If you reset your browser settings, you might need to turn some extensions back on,"" Google said.

""To turn extensions on, at the top right, click More More and then More Tools and then Extensions. Only turn on extensions you trust.""

Of course, make sure that you don't turn on any malicious extensions again.

It‚Äôs bringing a couple of new features to the app, making it easier to add tasks, and finally integrating its reminder system across Google Assistant, Calendar, and the rest of the Google suite of apps. The new changes should make Tasks a better to-do list app and might also make Google‚Äôs overall task management tools make sense. Finally.

Going forward, Google views Tasks as a hub for all your tasks across Google products. Hit the button that adds any Gmail thread to your to-do list so you can get to it later. Create reminders in Google Calendar, and they‚Äôll show up both in your schedule and in Tasks. Say ‚Äúhey Google, remind me to take out the trash at 9‚Äù to the Assistant on your phone or smart display and, you guessed it, it‚Äôll show up in Tasks.

This sounds good and pretty straightforward, right? Well, it is. And it should have been a long time ago. For years, Google‚Äôs reminder and task systems have been incomprehensibly divided; Google Reminders was different from Google Tasks, and a reminder in Calendar was different from a reminder in Keep, which was different from a reminder in Assistant. The only place to see all your to-dos in one place was the Google Calendar mobile app. It didn‚Äôt make any sense, and everybody knew it.

Even now, Google hasn‚Äôt fully solved its problem. Its announcement today doesn‚Äôt mention Keep, which likely means that app‚Äôs reminder system will still be separate. And the best version of this feature would extend across much more of Google‚Äôs ecosystem. It might notice when someone assigns something to you in Docs or Sheets, for instance, and add it to your to-do list.

Microsoft To Do is a good example of what Google should aim for: the app consolidates tasks across Outlook, Planner, and Teams so you can get a decent picture of what you‚Äôre working on everywhere. Microsoft has its own systemic issues ‚Äî there are Tasks and To Do and Outlook Tasks, all of which are different things ‚Äî but it‚Äôs trending in the right ‚Äúeverything everywhere‚Äù direction.

There‚Äôs also the fact that Google Tasks isn‚Äôt a particularly powerful app. As a universal list of reminders, it‚Äôll work well enough, and it lets you create multiple lists and star your most important tasks. It lacks some basic project management features like automatic sorting or priority levels, and you can‚Äôt even search your tasks. Plus, if you have a Google account for work and another for personal use, you‚Äôre going to be stuck with two totally disconnected lists. Tasks still won‚Äôt convince many people to ditch their dedicated to-do list app.

Still, it‚Äôs a good sign to see Google pay any attention at all to its task and reminders ecosystem. The company launched Tasks in 2018, then seemed to pretty much forget about it entirely. (I like to imagine a Google product manager setting a reminder to get back to improving Tasks and then it just never resurfaced because they created it in Keep.) This update both makes Tasks better and makes it a more important part of the overall Google productivity ecosystem, which might mean it stays on the priority list a bit longer this time.

The new Tasks experience is rolling out ‚Äúin the coming months,‚Äù Google VP of product management Ilya Brown wrote in a blog post, and it‚Äôll be opt-in at first before eventually becoming the default behavior. Google, with its search and AI prowess and its connection to practically all of your personal data, has always had the potential to build a killer task manager.

Fortunately, Google has loaded your Android phone with a free tool to help you avoid getting caught out.

Google Play Protect is a service that claims to help keep your apps safe and your data private.

It does this by checking your apps and devices for harmful behaviour.

Some of the benefits include a scan of any apps from Google Play before you download them.

It'll even deactivate or remove harmful apps from your device if it detects something fishy.

In addition, the alert service sends you privacy alerts about apps that can get user permissions to access your personal information.

How to turn on Google Play Protect

Google Play Protect should be switched on already by default.

The judge‚Äôs excoriation came in a multi-lawsuit legal action involving dozens of states, including California, accusing the Mountain View-based digital advertising giant of monopolizing the distribution of apps that use Google‚Äôs Android operating system.

Judge James Donato found Google broke federal court rules, and potentially weakened the antitrust case against the company, by auto-deleting internal employee messages the firm was obligated to hand over to the states and other plaintiffs as evidence.

‚ÄúGoogle has tried to downplay the problem and displayed a dismissive attitude ill tuned to the gravity of its conduct,‚Äù Donato wrote in his decision Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.

The plaintiffs, in a court filing Monday, had claimed Google engaged in ‚Äúa company-wide culture of concealment coming from the very top, including CEO Sundar Pichai.‚Äù

Bonta responded Tuesday to Donato‚Äôs findings, saying in a statement, ‚ÄúThis egregious behavior demonstrates the lengths that Google will go to maintain its anticompetitive stronghold on the marketplace.‚Äù

Google did not respond to a request for comment on Donato‚Äôs decision and the plaintiffs‚Äô allegations. The company is accused in the four related lawsuits of putting up contractual and technological barriers to block Android users from using other app-distribution platforms than the Google Play store.

The communications at issue in Donato‚Äôs ruling took place in Google‚Äôs internal instant-messaging system known as ‚ÄúChat.‚Äù Donato found that Google in the litigation had cast Chat as ‚Äúprimarily a social outlet akin to an electronic break room,‚Äù but in fact, company employees routinely used it to ‚Äúdiscuss substantive business topics, including matters relevant to this antitrust litigation.‚Äù

Chats involving hundreds of specific Google employees were supposed to be preserved for the court case via a ‚Äúhistory on‚Äù setting in the messaging platform, the judge wrote in his decision. Those communications would then be given to the plaintiffs to use as potential evidence, in a process called ‚Äúdiscovery.‚Äù Instead, Google ‚Äúintended to subvert the discovery process‚Äù and the Chat evidence ‚Äúwas lost .. with the intent to deprive (the plaintiffs) of the information‚Äôs use in the litigation,‚Äù Donato found.

Google initially claimed it had no ability to change default settings for individual employees‚Äô Chat history, but evidence in a court hearing ‚Äúplainly established that this representation was not truthful,‚Äù Donato wrote. He added that Google had the ability to set the Chat history function to ‚Äúon‚Äù for all the employees whose communications were relevant to the case, but chose not to.

Shortly after the case was filed in October 2020 and before the issue with the Chat function arose, the company ‚Äúfalsely assured the Court‚Äù that it had taken appropriate steps to preserve all relevant evidence ‚Äúwithout saying a word about Chats,‚Äù Donato wrote. ‚ÄúThe Court has repeatedly asked Google why it never mentioned Chat until the issue became a substantial problem. It has not provided an explanation, which is worrisome, especially in light of its unlimited access to accomplished legal counsel, and its long experience with the duty of evidence preservation.‚Äù

The plaintiffs claimed in their filing Monday that Google CEO Pichai in one Chat started to discuss a matter relevant to the antitrust case, then immediately asked if the Chat setting could be set to ‚Äúhistory off‚Äù so the message would auto-delete, before unsuccessfully trying to delete the ‚Äúincriminating‚Äù message himself.

Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week (and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here).

Galaxy S24 Snapdragon Wants To Be Everywhere

Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S handsets have a curious relationship with its System On Chip. While most run Samsung‚Äôs Exynos chipset, Snapdragon-powered handsets have popped up in the line-up. Last year saw Snapdragon used exclusively. And with the extra performance, many are hoping that they can get the Snapdragon version rather than the Exynos:

""The theory now is that the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ will use the unannounced Exynos 2400 SoC in some markets and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in others, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra will employ the Snapdragon chip everywhere in the world to appease fans.""

Several new details on Google‚Äôs upcoming Pixel phones leaked out this week via Google‚Äôs own Pixel Store. One picture, one alt text tag, and we know the special smartphone colour we‚Äôre getting for 2023:

""Sure, the device looks like the renders and images that have already leaked, including from a supposed internal Google video, but how can we be sure it‚Äôs that phone in that color? In a win for accessibility, the tipster notes that the image‚Äôs alt-text description removes all doubt, reading, ‚ÄúA person takes a call on a Pixel 8 Pro phone in Porcelain.‚Äù

Also on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro front is the launch date. Google might not have specifically mentioned its next phones, but everything points towards the reveal on October 4th:

""The in-person Made by Google event is set to take place in New York City at 10 a.m. ET, Google said Wednesday. Though Google didn't name any specific devices, it implied in a post on Threads that the event will include the reveal of the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Google has released a next-gen Pixel phone every fall since 2016.""

While the focus is on the Pixel phone this week, Google‚Äôs biggest Pixel device, the Pixel Tablet, is in line for a rather helpful software update that will help improve the media focus in the Tablet‚Äôs OS:

""More details on the media handoff feature (potentially called ""hold close to cast"") come from Mishaal Rahman, who has been exploring the latest Android code. To activate the feature, all you will need to do is hold your smartphone close to the Pixel Tablet, and the media will digitally jump from the phone to the tablet seamlessly.""

Honor Prepares Next Foldable For The International Market

At its IFA Keynote, Honor confirmed that its second folding smartphone will pick up a global release. Currently available in China, the 9.9mm thin Magic V2 builds on the the success of its predecessor while offering a smaller profile, more batter power, and an improved camera:

""The Magic V2 will go on sale in parts of Europe and the UK, among other countries, before the first quarter of next year. Honor says there are currently no plans for a release in the United States. The company didn't reveal pricing information but in its native China, the V2 starts at 8,999 yuan. This converts to roughly $1,250, ¬£970 or AU$1,850. ""

With Android 14 in the final stages before launch, it will not be long until manufacturers start shipping phones with the new version of the mobile operating system. As it stands, OnePlus could well be first to bring it to market when it updates Oxygen OS on September 25th:

""A public beta build of OxygenOS 14 is promised to be released in the coming days for the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 11R, and OnePlus Nord 3. While you may thus assume that all three of those devices are getting the stable release on September 25, the wording is vague enough that we feel the need to caution you here - there was no mention of which specific model(s) will be blessed to run the next iteration of the OS on that day, so we're going to assume it's just going to be the OnePlus 11.""

Also on the foldable front is Oppo‚Äôs flip-styled Find N3 Flip. It‚Äôs currently only available in China, but much like the last generation, expect a global release in 2024. With the rate of change, even an iterative update in the folding world is significant. And while the core specs and the screen are only slightly better, the real difference is in the camera:

‚Äú...one of the main gripes users have with flip phones is that they just aren't up to scratch with comparably priced Android phones. It's a fair criticism ‚Äì you'll have to sacrifice some battery capacity and camera functionality on most devices. But having that telephoto camera on-board signals a change in this regard. It marks a point where parity between those who fold and those who don't is closer than ever.""

Fairphone has a relatively unique place in the smartphone space. Thanks to the modular nature of its phones, replacing damaged parts is as simple as using a screwdriver. And the new Fairphone 5, launched this week, continues this tradition, as well as the ethical approach to consumer electronics:

‚Äú[Fairphone] looks to source materials from sustainable sources and use recycled or ethically mined materials as much as possible (with the company quoting seventy per cent of the handset uses these grades of materials). It also ensures a living wage is paid to those who work on the assembly line for the phone and its components.""

The latest sales figures suggest that Android has fallen behind iPhone in America. While success can be found in other regions, notably Europe, what has happened United States?

""The iPhone is so dominant in America that it's considered the default best phone. In American culture, there are memes mocking Android users, news reports of teens feeling left out at school if they're on an Android, and people being left off family group chats if they're not on iMessage. Android phones are considered second-grade devices to many Americans.""

After Windows became dominant, the Mac‚Äôs greatest liability was simply its incompatibility.

CEOs could count on Republicans to keep taxes low and regulations light‚Äîand largely let businesses govern themselves. Businesses returned the favor by filling Republican coffers with millions of dollars in campaign donations.

That cozy relationship tensed up during the Trump administration.

In one sense, President Donald Trump behaved as a traditional Republican, by cutting business taxes and slashing regulation. But he also launched trade wars against China and other economic partners, which gummed up supply chains and raised costs for thousands of US businesses. Trump also mounted unprecedented personal attacks against companies that didn‚Äôt do his bidding or somehow failed his loyalty tests.

Trump‚Äôs selective hostility to business has now escalated into a Republican broadside against virtually any company that violates the party‚Äôs new unwritten code of cultural regression. Republican culture-warriors label this a ‚Äúwar on wokeness,‚Äù or pushback against excessive cultural sensitivity. But nobody really knows what wokeness means, and Republicans are using that vagueness to attack any business that threatens their grip on power, or their pathway to it.

The seminal spectacle in the GOP‚Äôs breakup with business is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis‚Äôs battle with the Walt Disney Co., which is one of Florida‚Äôs largest employers and its single biggest taxpayer. DeSantis went after Disney last year, when it opposed a bill he backed that would restrict what Florida schools can teach young kids about sex and gender. DeSantis could have been normal politician and let Disney take whatever stance it felt was necessary to appease its customers, employees, and shareholders. The law passed, despite Disney‚Äôs objections, so DeSantis got what he wanted.

But DeSantis was a sore winner, and he revoked Disney‚Äôs self-governing status near its Orlando theme park. He tried to punish the company in other ways, too. Disney punched back with a legal maneuver to reclaim its municipal independence. DeSantis has vowed a fight to the death, and litigation could go on for years.

For what? Certainly not for any business-related principle. DeSantis is basically trying to use one of the world‚Äôs most famous brands as a foil in his campaign to become America‚Äôs culture-warrior-in-chief.

[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]

DeSantis picked a dumb fight with Disney that he could very well lose. Yet other Republicans seem to think the DeSantis-style war on wokeness is such a winning strategy they‚Äôre copying it. Some House Republicans are looking for ways to punish Disney beyond Florida, at the federal level. Republicans also hope to wage a ‚Äúwar on woke capitalism‚Äù as a part of their 2024 campaign to seize control of Congress and the White House.

Several Republican-led states, including Florida, Arizona, Louisiana, and North Dakota, have enacted rules or laws restricting state investments in money-managing firms that practice ESG investing, which means they take environmental, sustainability and governance into account when choosing which firms to do business with. That‚Äôs meant to punish Wall Street giants such as BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase that are pushing ESG as an ethical and savvy way to invest.

Then there are Republican efforts to break up or dismantle tech firms such as Facebook and Google. Montana recently banned TikTok, making it illegal to download the app as of next January. If the bill survives an inevitable legal challenge, it would fine TikTok, Google, Apple or any business that makes the app available inside Montana at a rate of $10,000 per day.

Republican aren‚Äôt taking a stand against profits, per se, or against capitalism writ large, the way the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party does. They‚Äôre attacking businesses on an ad hoc basis when it suits some other political goal.

Yet this violates the whole ethos of laissez-faire capitalism, the Republican concept of setting minimalist rules for businesses and then getting out of the way. Republicans are still more or less content to keep taxes low and regulations lean, but it now comes with a hefty price: Businesses, in return, must abide by a retrograde Republican ideology that‚Äôs out-of-touch with mainstream Americans.

It would be an overstatement to say the Democrats are seizing the opportunity to buddy up with corporate America. President Biden has trash-talked fossil-fuel companies, proposed a hike in business taxes and ratcheted up regulations. Yet Biden has also eased trade frictions with friendly nations, and it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs Democrats who want to raise the federal borrowing limit and avoid a destabilizing threat of default. Plus Biden probably seems quite friendly to green-energy firms and many other businesses that will benefit from billions of dollars in subsidies in bills Biden has backed and signed, such as last year‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act.

There‚Äôs no rule that says one of America‚Äôs major political parties has to represent the interests of big business. Some Americans think corporate America has had too much sway over public priorities for far too long. More distance between lobbyists and policymakers may even be appropriate. Still, regulating business should be about making the economy as productive as possible‚Äînot about scoring points or settling grievances.

What is the new charging feature?

With its iOS 16.1 update, Apple introduced a new feature called Clean Energy Charging. Apple states that this is a way for iPhone users to reduce their carbon footprint, ultimately benefiting the environment.

Enabling the Clean Energy Charging feature means that when you plug in your iPhone to charge it, it gets a forecast of the carbon emissions in your local energy grid and uses that forecast to charge your iPhone during times of cleaner energy production.

NOW YOU CAN ADD CHATGPT TO YOUR BROWSER

Clean Energy Charging does not turn on every time you charge your phone. Rather, it typically only kicks in when you are charging your phone at locations you are at most often, like at home or work. It will also kick in at these locations if you are charging your phone for an extended period.

It will not kick in if you are charging your phone at a new location (such as when on vacation) or if your charging habits often vary. When it does kick in, you will always be notified, and you can long-press the notification to turn the feature off if you do not want it used. More on that later.

Why are people upset over this new feature?

The main reason why this feature is upsetting people is that they claim it was causing their iPhones to charge much slower than they had before this feature was implemented.

People are also complaining that the setting was turned on by default after updating their iPhones, as they did not want Apple deciding how they would spend their energy for them. However, there is a way to turn this feature off if it is not something that you are interested in using.

The Apple executives ‚Äî Eduardo Cue, John Giannandrea and Adrian Perica ‚Äî had argued in Washington, D.C., federal court that compelling them to testify at trial was ""duplicative"" and ""unduly burdensome,"" since they had already answered questions at an earlier stage in the case.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in a brief order on Monday denied Apple's effort to quash the subpoenas.

Companies often try to bar or minimize subpoenas seeking testimony or information from top executives.

Apple, which is not a defendant, said it has been the subject of ""overbroad"" demands in the case and that it already has disclosed more than 125,000 documents from senior executives.

Cue oversees Apple Music, Apple TV and other services. Giannandrea is the executive in charge of machine learning and AI strategy, and Perica oversees Apple's corporate development wing, including leading the company's mergers and acquisitions efforts.

Representatives from Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.

Google and its lawyers have denied any wrongdoing in the case, one of two Justice Department antitrust lawsuits against Google.

A lawyer for Google, John Schmidtlein, told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in D.C. at a hearing this year that ""offering a superior product, winning business on the merits is never unlawful.""

The Justice Department said its case centers on Google's sharing of billions of dollars in annual advertising revenue with business partners such as Apple in exchange for Google's search being default on other companies' devices.

The government has called Apple ""chief among Google's distribution partners"" and said Google's relationship with Apple through an information-services agreement ""will be a central issue at trial.""

Apple's attorneys warned recently that trial testimony would force the lawyers and Mehta to ""navigate the risks of inadvertent disclosure of its most competitively sensitive information.""

In a filing, Apple said it wanted to shield information concerning business negotiations, confidential contract terms and ""forward-looking product opportunities.""

Attorneys for Apple argued that the company had ""provided all the discovery (and more) that the parties could need for trial.""

The bench trial is set to begin on Sept. 12 in Mehta's court.

The case is United States v. Google, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 1:20-cv-03010-APM.

For U.S.: Kenneth Dintzer of the U.S. Justice Department

For Google: John Schmidtlein of Williams & Connolly

Malware can steal sensitive data, such as banking credentials, and it can infect through many ways - for instance, by downloading apps from unknown sources or opening attachments from unsolicited emails.

If malware is installed, it may significantly decline device performance, allow unauthorised access to the device's system and data, and install unauthorised applications.

To keep one's devices safe, the joint advisory issued on Tuesday (11 April) advised the public to be careful when downloading suspicious Android/Chrome/Google-related updates or any dubious Android Package Kit (APK) files onto their mobile devices, as these files are not official files released by Google.

Some of these dubious files may even come with seemingly genuine naming conventions, such as the following:

To keep devices safe from malware, it is important to only download and install apps from official app stores like Google Play Store for Android.

Before downloading, check the developer info, number of downloads, and user reviews to make sure it is legitimate. Be cautious when clicking on ads within apps, and do not grant permission to pop-ups that request access to your device's hardware or data.

Make sure the device has updated anti-virus/anti-malware apps that can detect and remove malware, and that the operating system and apps are updated regularly with the latest security patches.

If you suspect that your device may be infected with malware, turn on ""flight mode"" and perform an anti-virus/anti-malware scan.

And if you find any unknown apps, uninstall them immediately, contact the manufacturer for assistance, or reformat the device to factory default if it still shows signs of infection. Before reformatting, back up your device data on an external storage device.

To find out more about mobile malware and preventive steps to keep your mobile devices safe and secure, you can refer to the CSA‚Äô SingCERT advisory.

Flashback: The states' investigation into Google and location tracking kicked off in 2018 after an Associated Press story reported on Google recording user movement even when users had certain settings turned off.

Why it matters: For Google, the agreement marks another pricy privacy settlement with the states, which have taken the lead in U.S. privacy enforcement in the absence of a national online consumer privacy law.
‚Ä¢ Google just agreed to pay $85 million to settle a privacy lawsuit brought on by Arizona, and is fighting several others.

Details: The AGs write in the settlement that Google violated state consumer protection laws by not being clear about its policies, including the ""Web & App Activity"" setting, which is turned on by default.

In addition to the monetary settlement, Google agreed to, starting in 2o23:
‚Ä¢ show more information to users when a location-related account setting is turned on or off;
‚Ä¢ make information about location tracking more visible; and
‚Ä¢ give users ""detailed information about the types of location data Google collects and how it's used at an enhanced 'Location Technologies' page.""
‚Ä¢ The settlement also limits Google's use of certain types of location information.

What they're saying: ""Citizens must be able to make informed decisions about what information they release to Big Tech,"" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said in a statement.

‚Ä¢ Asset managers big and small, from Carlyle and Apollo to Serengeti and Shamrock, are pushing into the space.
‚Ä¢ Here's how 5 top players are investing credit in media, entertainment, and sports.

The entertainment industry's love affair with private credit is one of the hottest storylines in Hollywood right now.

Credit lenders are saying ""lights, camera, action"" to the idea of deploying dollars into movies, TV, and live sports. Private-credit assets under management in media grew to nearly $80 billion in mid-2022 from some $31 billion in 2018, according to an analysis by the data firm Preqin for Insider.

Christopher Marinac, director of research at the financial-services firm Janney Montgomery Scott, pointed to several reasons why, in the months and years ahead, he believes private-credit lenders will step up their strategies in media, entertainment, and sports.

For one, exposure to media and entertainment franchises gives lenders access to the industry's cultural cachet ‚Äî which often includes public pronouncements about diversity, equity, and inclusion. For asset managers, it's feasible that addressing their ESG imperatives through values around DEI could mean incurring ""a lot less harm"" than by pursuing strategies in electricity, energy, or environment sustainability, he said.

For another, borrowers need access to liquidity fast while the cost of new content surges and a writers' strike foments instability in Hollywood, shutting down much production on film and TV. Despite private loans' sometimes onerous terms, they come with the added bonus of letting borrowers maintain all of their equity, which is an often-attractive proposition for founders.

Private credit has become a catch-all term for lending and debt investments outside the public markets, and almost always involves an asset management business like Apollo or Blackstone instead of a traditional bank like Bank of America or Citigroup. The asset has rapidly expanded since post-global financial crisis regulations pared back banks' lending practices.

But the space is certainly not devoid of risk. Analysts at the rating agency Moody's warned in a report last week that high volumes of credit lent by non-bank institutions could be in jeopardy as borrowers struggle to make interest payments, citing the Fed's series of rate hikes and an economy on an uncertain footing. ""Macro stresses will spur higher defaults and possibly weaker recoveries"" among borrowers, the analysts cautioned.

Insider previously reported that analysts were warning of the risks that could mount across private credit as rates rise.

Even so, those headwinds may not slow private lenders for long. Banks are facing their own deterrents from lending ‚Äî like the liquidity crunches that torpedoed regional firms such as SVB and First Republic this year. They may grow even more risk-averse, which could curb their appetite for lending, with the Fed's stress tests scheduled for late June, Marinac said.

Insider reviewed several large-cap banks' 2023 regulatory disclosures and found that, while some of the largest banks lend heavily to real estate, retail, and financial-services companies, they've generally allocated far less exposure to firms in technology, media, and telecommunications.

Bank of America said it had about $15 billion in credit exposure to the media sector at the end of the first quarter of 2023. That's compared with more than $102 billion in asset managers and funds and $73 billion in real estate. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase said in its 2022 10-K filing that it had nearly $80 billion in credit exposure to the TMT sector, but more than double that ‚Äî almost $171 billion ‚Äî in real estate, and more than $123 billion in the consumer and retail sector.

Insider gathered details on asset managers' lending strategies in Hollywood, media, and sports. Even as they battle inflation, a slowing economy, and a historic writers' strike, here's what execs at five firms ‚Äî large and small, listed alphabetically ‚Äî say they're energized about.","How 5 private-credit players, from Apollo to Carlyle, are investing in sports, media, and entertainment as content costs soar and a writers' strike paralyzes Hollywood",non-causal,"TMT, DEI, TV, ESG, SVB","['DDB', 'TWIX', 'EVP', 'CEO']","['DDB', 'EVP']","['DEI', 'TMT', 'SVB', 'ESG', 'TV']","['DEI', 'TMT', 'SVB', 'TV', 'ESG', 'EVP', 'CEO', 'OMC', 'DDB', 'TWIX']",-0.8362821

Samsung S23 enables users to take high-resolution images of the moon zoomed in a hundred times, while the Google Pixel 7 removes photobombers in selfies.

iOS and google-powered devices have the same number of cameras, but Androids were early adopters of high-resolution sensors and lenses that provide zoom than its rival.

DailyMail.com has rounded up some of the craziest hidden features from the latest cell phones from Google and Samsung ‚Äî and compared them to Apple to help you decide which is the best.

Samsung S23: Take a clear photo of the moon and snap another by saying ‚Äòcheese‚Äô

Want to take a 100-times zoom picture of the moon? Samsung has your back - with a function that elicited a ‚Äòwow‚Äô from tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.

Highlighted by Twitter user and web producers Marquis Brownlees, the function uses multiple shots to add detail to the image.

Some have claimed that Samsung‚Äôs AI adds more detail to the photograph that is not there, but Samsung has in the past explained that the camera system uses several images to create the ‚Äòzoomed in‚Äô effect.

Using Samsung‚Äôs Expert RAW application, you can access Astrophotography and Astrohyperlapse for the best night sky photography.

The astrophotography mode uses advanced AI segmentation and multi-frame processing to get the best results out of the night sky.

The mode includes a sky guide that points out constellations and nebulae.

Samsung phones also let you trigger the camera with your voice - which is helpful for capturing group shots.

This allows you to capture pictures by saying ‚Äòsmile,‚Äô ‚Äòcheese,' ‚Äòcapture‚Äô or ‚Äòshoot‚Äô and works with either the front or rear camera.

Google‚Äôs Pixel phones have a function called ‚ÄòMagic Eraser' that automatically highlights people in the background to let you remove them from your shots.

Just tap any photo in your library (it only works on images taken with a Pixel), and it will offer an option to ‚ÄòRemove People in the Background‚Äô with the magic eraser icon.

The app will automatically highlight people with a white outline, and you can tap to remove them - it‚Äôs not always perfect, though.

If you capture someone on a bicycle, for example, the system is prone to cutting out the person but leaving a ghostly bicycle behind.

There‚Äôs also a ‚Äòcamouflage‚Äô option, in which you manually cover people with the background.

Google‚Äôs Lens app isn‚Äôt something the tech giant tends to shout about, but it has some seriously crazy features.

You can take pictures of animals and plants, and Google‚Äôs AI will identify them from your image.

DailyMail.com tested this with a small brown bird correctly identified as a Guinea Fowl, and if you focus on leaves or flowers, it‚Äôs pretty good at identifying plants too.

The app can also turn any text - a poster, a letter, a menu - into machine-readable text.

To access Lens, go to Modes in your Pixel‚Äôs camera, then activate it.

Google has your back if you‚Äôve got some photos you don‚Äôt want to share with the world.

Hold your finger on the screen to take a photo directly into a Locked Folder on your phone, which can‚Äôt be opened without biometric authentication or a password.

A lock icon appears, and your next photo will go to the Locked Folder.

On Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro, you can select where your photos go by long-pressing on the icon in the bottom right, which shows the last picture you took.

The new iPhone 14 enables you to capture shots similar to ones in films where a ‚Äògimbal‚Äô is used for a moving camera effect.

Action mode on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models allows you to capture smooth hand-held video even when you‚Äôre moving a lot - with built-in stabilization.

To activate it, open the Camera app and swipe to video mode. Tap the 'Action mode' icon to turn it on, then tap the shutter to record your video.

Samsung‚Äôs latest crop of smartphones offers the capacity to record in 8K - a resolution 16 times sharper than Full HD.

Not only that, but it‚Äôs four times sharper than Ultra HD - four times sharper than almost all televisions you can buy.

So what‚Äôs the point? If you‚Äôre shooting in 8K (it refers to the nearly eight thousand pixels (7,680 by 4,320) horizontally, it offers you as a filmmaker the option to pan and crop more easily as you have ‚Äòspare‚Äô pixels on the screen.

The latest iOS update lets you quick-record videos without switching out of Photo mode.

It works on devices including iPhone XS, iPhone XR, and later

Touch and hold the Shutter button, and the Camera begins recording a QuickTake video.

Release the button to stop recording or slide to the right to lock for a more extended recording.

Apple's Live Photos records what happens 1.5 seconds before and after your shot - this is ideal for capturing reluctant or fast-moving subjects.

Live Photos is enabled by default (you can see it's on by the circular icon in the top right).

You can also turn photos into a video loop - or a 'Bounce' effect where it plays backward.

You can also enable a Long Exposure effect (similar to what's possible on a DSLR camera) where fireworks become streaks across the sky.

To choose your effect, simply tap on the live photo icon and select Loop, Bounce or Long Exposure.

There are plenty of reasons you might want to hide a photo on an iPhone - from buying a present for a partner to keeping images hidden from young children.

On iPhone, you can not only hide photos but also hide the folder you hide them in.

Open Photos, tap the photo you want to hide, then the three dots and 'Hide,' and select ‚ÄòHide Photo.'

To hide the whole folder, go into Photos and toggle off 'Show Hidden Album.'",Crazy cellphone camera features including 100x zoom for MOON images,non-causal,"HD, DSLR, AI, RAW, XS, XR","['TEEN', 'CBS', 'SCBA']",[],"['XR', 'RAW', 'HD', 'DSLR', 'XS', 'AI']","['TEEN', 'CBS', 'SCBA', 'XR', 'RAW', 'HD', 'DSLR', 'XS', 'AI', 'NSC']",-0.99989945

The GOP campaign plan is to ding President Biden and his fellow Democrats for high inflation, while exploiting voter concerns over crime and illegal immigration. It might work. Data site fivethirtyeight gives Republicans good odds of winning the House and lesser odds of winning the Senate. Republicans only need to control one chamber to block Biden‚Äôs legislative agenda and redirect Congress‚Äôs focus.

If Republicans do take the House, they seem poised to mount a debt-ceiling showdown, as has happened several times before‚Äîusually triggering voter disgust. Legislation dating to 1917 sets a limit on the total amount of federal borrowing, with Congressional approval required when the government needs to borrow more. Congress has raised the debt ceiling many times, usually without much of a ripple. But Republicans have developed a strategy of holding up debt ceiling extensions for political purposes, knowing that financial markets would crater if Washington couldn‚Äôt pay what it owes, and had to default. By threatening financial chaos, the (il)logic goes, Republicans draw attention to policy priorities voters would otherwise ignore.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who would probably become House Speaker if Republicans prevail in November, recently told Punchbowl News that his party might demand government spending cuts in order to vote to extend Washington‚Äôs borrowing limit. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just continue down the path to keep spending and adding to the debt,‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúYou got to change your current behavior.‚Äù The problem is, Republicans would probably propose something drastic that President would be sure to veto, setting up a possible debt-ceiling smackdown.

The last time Congress raised the debt ceiling was in December 2021. It didn‚Äôt really make news because nothing dramatic happened. Democrats who controlled Congress weren‚Äôt going to cause chaos on their own watch, so they raised by borrowing limit by enough to last for about 18 months.

Republicans broadly voted against raising the debt ceiling then, knowing they could vote that way, as the minority, and the extension would pass anyway. Republicans, in fact, are usually deficit hawks when they‚Äôre out of power. They become more dovish when they‚Äôre running the government, however. The GOP controlled Congress and the White House for the first two years of the Trump presidency, from 2017 to 2019. They passed a big tax cut bill, but did nothing to curtail spending. Federal deficits during Trump‚Äôs first three years in office averaged about $1.1 trillion per year, the same as under President Obama before him. Including 2020, when Congress passed massive amounts of federal stimulus, federal deficits under Trump averaged about $2.1 trillion per year.

[Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or sound off.]

Republicans hint that they‚Äôll use the next debt-ceiling deadline, which will probably occur in mid or late 2023, to tighten up eligibility requirements for Social Security and Medicare, and impose work requirements for some welfare programs. They won‚Äôt actually get any of that, and everybody knows it. Biden would veto any such legislation, if a Republican-controlled Congress passed it. If Republicans control just one chamber and simply block a debt-ceiling extension, demanding spending cuts as a condition of extending it, Biden will call their bluff and Republicans will back down at the last second. That‚Äôs how the play has ended every other time Republicans have performed it.

The debt-ceiling drama usually has little impact on markets, since everybody knows the script. The one exception came in 2011, when down-to-the-wire negotiations caused a sharp stock selloff and led Standard & Poor‚Äôs to cut the US credit rating by one notch, because of ‚Äúpolitical brinkmanship.‚Äù The debt is much bigger now, as percentage of GDP, than it was in 2011. And interest rates the government must pay to finance the debt are higher. So who knows, the threshold for market mayhem in 2023 may be lower.

There are at least two other scenarios in which voters might rue a Republican Congress, or one Republican-controlled chamber able to block Biden-backed legislation. The first scenario is a recession that might call for new fiscal stimulus measures. Economists now think there‚Äôs at least a 50-50 chance of a recession by early 2023, and Republicans have spent a lot of breath complaining about the last big stimulus bill Democrats passed, with no GOP support, in 2021. If there‚Äôs any stimulus at all during a 2023 recession, Republicans will want to make it smaller rather than larger, and they might block it completely while claiming there‚Äôs still stimulus money in the system from 2021.

Republicans also seem less inclined to approve military aid for Ukraine, with McCarthy telling Punchbowl, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a free blank check.‚Äù Reduced aid for Ukraine wouldn‚Äôt affect American voters directly, except that Americans seem to favor vigorous aid to Ukraine and a foreceful rebuke to Russia. As disruptive as Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine is, it would be worse if Russia were to win and feel emboldened to threaten other European countries or wreak even more havoc on global food and energy markets.

If Republicans do ascend in the midterms, they‚Äôll mostly use these tactics to demonstrate why voters should return the GOP to full control of government in 2024. Voters appreciate restraint, and may welcome a less activist approach than the Biden Democrats have offered. But they don‚Äôt love chaos, and we may find out next year if Republicans realize that.

This weekend has seen a small but significant win, as a tablet-focused update to Instagram has started to roll out for users of the Pixel Tablet and Galaxy Z Fold 5.

The update means that, with your tablet in portrait mode, Instagram pushes out your feed to the edges of the screen. The main navigation icons (such as home, new post, and search) are now shown in the sidebar. When you start to watch video Reels, the interaction icons will snap to the sides of the screen rather than the sides of the video.

It‚Äôs not complete, though.... With your tablet held in landscape mode, Instagram defaults to expecting a smartphone screen, and the dreaded black blocks appear on either side of the app‚Äôs main screen. And, of course, this is a staggered roll-out, with only some accounts getting access to the new software.

In time, this should be available both to every Instagram user and to every Android tablet.

Why is this important? One of the biggest weaknesses in Android‚Äôs large-screened hardware is support from app developers. There is little point in consumers and enterprise partners investing in an Android tablet if the Android apps do not deliver a tablet-first experience. It‚Äôs a nice backstop to have the tablets ‚Äòfake‚Äô being a phone to the software, but that wastes so much potential.

Yet developers will not code for Android tablets if there are no users.

This is why the Android team will welcome Meta‚Äôs addition to a tablet mode to the Instagram app. The core apps of a user‚Äôs life are not limited to the first-party web browser, email client, and video player that Google ships with Android. Instagram is one of the third-party apps that countless millions rely on.

Those million will want Instagram on a tablet to act like Instagram on a tablet, not Instagram pretending to be a phone on a tablet.

Having Instagram be tablet-ready is another outward sign that the tablet ecosystem is growing, which benefits not just Google and the Pixel Tablet but also Samsung‚Äôs Tab series, new tablets from Honor and OnePlus, and the growing number of tablets and foldable from Google‚Äôs Android partners.

Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week (and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here).

Samsung‚Äôs annual update to the Galaxy S series may not be due a reveal until February, but details from the supply chain are giving us a better idea of what to expect every week. How about a 200-megapixel camera? It‚Äôs doable, although Samsung may restrict it to a ‚Äòregular‚Äô mode and a ‚Äòridiculous‚Äô mode with nothing in-between 12 MP or 200 MP:

""Like the Galaxy S21 Ultra or Galaxy S22 Ultra‚Äôs 108MP camera, the S23 Ultra won‚Äôt actually shoot at the maximum resolution by default. It will reportedly capture 12.5MP images using pixel binning (a process that merges multiple small pixels into one single large pixel) for improved image quality, especially in low-light conditions. The option to shoot at the full 200MP resolution will no doubt be available, as well, but a new rumor says Samsung will not offer the ability to shoot 50MP pictures, unlike the competition.""

Just as the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 pro were not the final word in the Pixel 6 family, could the Pixel 7 have more models in the future? A smaller Pixel 7a later in 2023 feels obvious, but what of something larger? Step forward the Pixel 7 Ultra, with hints of larger camera sensors and improved connectivity lurking in the software:

""According to developer Kuba Wojciechowski(opens in new tab), who delved into the source code for the Pixel 7 series, the Pixel Ultra (codenamed ""Lynx"") will most likely ship with Qualcomm's Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth chip (WCN6740) rather than the Broadcom BCM4389 found in the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 lines. If this is correct, the rumored device will see an upgrade in connectivity performance.""

Google may not stop its current smartphone ambitions with the mythical Pixel 7 Pro. Documents seen by The Information note not only Google‚Äôs more focused approach to its hardware but also highlighting Samsung‚Äôs falling market share compared to the iPhone. If Android needs a new flag-bearer, Google may be ready to step up with hardware to go with the software:

""Google is ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on Pixel phones and its own hardware. This apparently includes moving product development and software engineering staff to work on Google-branded devices rather than features for non-Google hardware.""

Honor has launched its latest budget-focused smartphone. The Honor X6, priced at ¬£149 in the UK, stands out with a massive 5000 mAh battery, a triple-lens camera system at the rear, and removable storage that complements the 4 GB RAM and 64 GB Storage on the single option:

""Delivering a smart and seamless user experience, the HONOR X6 runs on HONOR Magic UI 6.1 based on Android 12. Featuring HONOR Share, the HONOR X6 enables speedy wireless file transfers across HONOR devices including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. With the Efficient Smart Desktop feature, users can customise widgets on the home screen and access information without opening the apps, further boosting efficiency and productivity.""

It Just Goes To 11

Is OnePlus returning to a more streamlined product lineup for its flagship numerical devices? With the Nord series happily providing options at the low- and mid-range, a number of sources are suggesting the flagship range could be rationalized to a single titular model name in 2023‚Ä¶ no Pro, no Plus, no Ultra Max Super Fine‚Ä¶ just the OnePlus 11:

""If the information turns out to be true, one would assume that OnePlus is also looking into the option of streamlining its flagship series as a whole. The core flagship series will get no more than two models in the first half of the year with a potential ""T"" upgrade in the second half. That hasn't been the case since 2018 and the OnePlus 6.""

Nothing Costs A Little Bit More

Nothing Tech‚Äôs first product, the Ear (1) true wireless buds, was launched last year at a $99 price point and offered a lot of value in the busy market. One of the key advantages - pricing - has gone in the face of economic conditions around the world and Nothing‚Äôs increased costs. The competition may be forced to follow, but for now $99 becomes $149:

""Nothing is hiking the price of its debut Ear 1 earbuds from $99 to $149, the company‚Äôs CEO Carl Pei has announced. Citing ‚Äúan increase in costs,‚Äù Pei said that the new price will come into effect on October 26th. No price changes were announced for Nothing‚Äôs more recently-announced Phone 1 smartphone.""

With the upcoming release of Android 12L, Google is putting more visible effort into its tablet apps. Next up is Chrome, and the Google Keyword blog has more updates on improving the browser for your larger-screened devices.

""It can sometimes be challenging to grab the right tab on a smaller screen, especially when you have a bunch of tabs open. That‚Äôs why we added a new side-by-side design that makes finding the right tab easier in Chrome. If you‚Äôre switching back and forth between two tabs, the auto-scroll back feature can help you swipe back to your previous tab. And to help prevent you from accidentally closing tabs in the first place, we‚Äôll hide the close button when tabs become too small. If you close a tab you didn‚Äôt intend to, one-step restore can get you right back to where you were.""

Samsung is mulling a switch from Google to Microsoft‚Äôs Bing as the default search engine on its smartphones and tablets, the New York Times reported Sunday, putting a contract worth a reported $3 billion per year in jeopardy. Though that represents just over 1% of Alphabet‚Äôs roughly $280 billion in annual revenue, it‚Äôs the latest indication that Google‚Äôs search engine dominance may be fading, with the Times reporting there was ‚Äúpanic‚Äù among Alphabet employees over the Samsung contract. Alphabet shares slid as much as 4.1% in early trading Monday, shedding $57 billion in market capitalization, while Microsoft shares climbed 1.6%. That continues a months-long trend of Microsoft‚Äôs stock outperforming Alphabet‚Äôs, as Microsoft shares are up 21% since the November launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs viral chatbot incorporated into Bing; Alphabet shares are up 10% during the same period. Microsoft has an ‚Äúearly lead‚Äù in the artificial intelligence space as it exhibits a ‚Äúrenewed vigor‚Äù in the search market, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Kash Rangan wrote in a note to clients last month.

Microsoft announced in January it made a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, reportedly infusing $10 billion into the budding generative AI company and taking what will be a 49% stake in the firm. Just three weeks later, Microsoft rolled out its integration of ChatGPT into Bing and its Edge web browser. Bard, Google‚Äôs answer to ChatGPT, has received more lukewarm feedback, with Alphabet shares tanking 7% on February 8 after the chatbot provided inaccurate information during a demo.

Wired reported in 2021 that the company struggled over the years to adequately lock down data, including customer order histories, amassed during years of breakneck growth. A year earlier, Amazon said it had fired some employees who leaked customer email addresses and phone numbers to an unspecified third party.

Amazon has ramped up its privacy practices in recent years amid scrutiny from the media, privacy advocacy groups and the FTC. Alexa, most commonly found in the Echo line of smart speakers, is designed to record audio when it hears a ‚Äúwake word‚Äù and transmits user commands to read a news report or fetch the weather to Amazon‚Äôs servers. By default, the company stores that data indefinitely, though Amazon has added tools that let users auto-delete recordings and opt out of having their voices used to train Alexa‚Äôs systems.

Kristy Schmidt, an Amazon spokesperson, didn‚Äôt say how many employees can access Alexa recordings today. ‚ÄúWe have strict policies and practices in place to limit access to voice recordings only to authorized employees,‚Äù she said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúThese employees use voice recordings to create new features, help our customer service teams troubleshoot issues for customers, and train and improve Alexa.‚Äù In a separate blog post, Amazon said it disagreed with the FTC‚Äôs claims and denied violating the law.

The complaint, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the FTC, also says Amazon repeatedly failed to delete Alexa users‚Äô data, even after customers asked it to. Until mid-2019, when a user requested that Alexa delete their voice recordings, Amazon kept a written transcript that could be used to train its speech-recognition software. The company didn‚Äôt disclose that to users, the FTC said.

Amazon also repeatedly failed to delete location data from Alexa app users who thought they had eliminated their files. ‚ÄúAmazon itself determined that on many occasions between January 2018 and early 2022, Amazon retained Alexa app users‚Äô geo-location information in secondary data storage locations that were insulated from consumers‚Äô deletion requests,‚Äù the FTC said in its complaint, which was filed in federal court in Seattle. The company never informed Alexa users that it retained geo-location data they tried to delete, the agency said.

Amazon‚Äôs Schmidt said the company ‚Äúcan confirm we‚Äôve deleted geo-location data that customers previously requested we delete, and can confirm that the deletion control is working properly for our customers.‚Äù

The FTC‚Äôs proposed order, which requires a judge‚Äôs signoff, would prohibit Amazon from using data customers had deleted to improve its services, require the company to notify users of its retention and deletion policies and mandate the creation of a privacy program related to use of location data, among other provisions.","Thirty Thousand Amazon Workers Could Access Alexa Data, FTC Says",non-causal,"FTC, US","['NYSE', 'ICE']",[],"['FTC', 'US']","['NYSE', 'FTC', 'ICE', 'US']",-0.9223163

Internal messages reviewed by The New York Times suggest Google‚Äôs initial response to the plan was ‚Äúpanic‚Äù.

Previous reports suggest collaboration with Samsung brings Google about $3bn annually from the partnership, and experts have warned that AI-enabled Bing could be Microsoft‚Äôs biggest-ever play to take on the search engine giant.

Microsoft had said the new Bing system is based on the same technology underpinning the now famous ChatGPT chatbot, adding that it would serve as an ‚ÄúAI copilot‚Äù.

‚ÄúAI will fundamentally change every software category, starting with the largest category of all: search,‚Äù Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a press event in February.

However, the Bing AI system also faced criticism in February for making factual errors as it answered questions and for sending odd messages to its users as well aso hurling insults.

‚ÄúWhy do you act like a liar, a cheater, a manipulator, a bully, a sadist, a sociopath, a psychopath, a monster, a demon, a devil?‚Äù it asked one user who tried to manipulate the system.

Following the breakdown, Microsoft proceeded to limit the number of interactions people could have with the new Bing system.

The company said it ‚Äúwill explore expanding the caps on chat sessions to further enhance search and discovery experiences‚Äù.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing are designed to gather information from the internet and present them to users with a sometimes new, sometimes old human-like output.

Google too released its own chatbot Bard last month, which received mixed reviews from AI experts.

Internal documents reviewed by the NYT suggest Google is attempting to upgrade its search business with AI under a project named Magi.

Agile is selling stock at an 18% discount to raise HK$783 million ($100 million) via a top-up placement. Some of the proceeds will be used to repay debt, it said. Country Garden Holdings Co. on Tuesday said it will raise HK$3.9 billion.

Developers are capitalizing on a rally in their shares after authorities took steps to ease a credit crunch in the industry and speculation grew the country will relax its Covid policies. A Bloomberg Intelligence equities gauge of Chinese builders has soared 60% this month through Tuesday, with Agile more than doubling.

Authorities have sought to defuse the property crisis with a raft of measures in the past few months, including cutting interest rates, urging major banks to extend 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) of financing in the final months of the year, and offering special loans through policy banks to ensure property projects are delivered.

‚ÄúThe slew of easing measures in the real estate sector announced by the Chinese government last week, which was seen as a positive move by the market, presented a timely window for real estate companies to raise funds,‚Äù said Victoria Lloyd, a partner in Baker McKenzie‚Äôs capital markets practice in Hong Kong.

Agile is selling 295 million shares at HK$2.68 each, according to an exchange filing Wednesday. Its shares traded at a record low HK$1.49 at the end of last month. The stock was down 17% to HK$2.70 at 9:57 a.m. local time.

China‚Äôs home prices fell the most in seven years in October, underscoring the depths of the downturn that prompted policy makers to bail out the sector. New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, dropped 0.37% last month from September, a 14th straight decline, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Wednesday. The existing-home market fared worse, down 0.47%, the steepest decline since 2014.

Before the rescue, China‚Äôs offshore property notes plummeted to record lows as defaults mounted to unprecedented levels. The rout had its roots in a crackdown that started in 2020 on excessive leverage at developers as well as speculation among homebuyers, and was worsened by Covid restrictions that exacerbated a slump in housing sales.

Agile, which develops villa apartments and high-rise homes set amid landscaped gardens, was among builders that met with one of China‚Äôs key bond-market regulators earlier this month about offering support to domestic note sales, the official Securities Times reported.

1. Has Elon Musk lost his Midas touch? Elon Musk built his fortune on being first, senior correspondent Linette Lopez writes. He was early to see the potential of mass-producing electric cars and reusable rockets. But his big bets with Twitter and Tesla are behind the curve ‚Äî and they could blow up in his face.
‚Ä¢ The first of these poorly timed bets, Linette writes, is Twitter. During the pandemic, tech stocks ‚Äî including social-media companies ‚Äî were flying high. Since then, the stock market has gotten smashed, and social-media stocks have been some of the hardest hit.
‚Ä¢ Musk's second behind-the-times bet is the Chinese consumer. Musk needs a healthy Chinese market to validate Tesla's big investment in the country, but given a weak consumer sentiment and a slowing economy, it may not be there for him.
‚Ä¢ This will be his companies' first attempt at surviving a stock-market collapse and a global economic downturn. These kinds of economic conditions rock even the most stable companies, and neither Tesla ‚Äî which just started making money last year ‚Äî nor Twitter has ever been that.

Plus, staying with Musk, a judge thinks it's possible that Twitter whistleblower Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko emailed Musk's attorney to ask for a job, months before he came forward with his claims against the social media company. We've got the details here.

Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Tuesday classified the recall of Teleflex Inc's (TFX.N) Iso-Gard filter S, a medical device to protect patients from potential airborne contaminants, as most serious, saying its use could lead to injuries or death. 

The company recalled some models of the filter in August, after receiving reports of it splitting and getting detached from patients' respiratory devices during use, which may lead to insufficient supply of air for patient as well as potential cross-contamination. 

It had recalled about 2.7 million filters distributed between Sept. 1, 2020 to July 5, 2022.","U.S. health regulators on Tuesday classified the recall of Teleflex Inc's Iso-Gard filter S, a medical device to protect patients from potential airborne contaminants, as most serious, saying its use could lead to injuries or death.",TFX,Health Care,Medical Equipment & Supplies,Teleflex Inc,2023-08-16T16:20:00.471000+00:00,2023-08-16,2023-08-16T16:20:00.471000+00:00,[],"A trust linked to one of China‚Äôs wealth management giants has failed to make payouts on dozens of products in another sign of trouble in the country‚Äôs economy. Multiple clients at Zhongrong International Trust reported in recent weeks that payments have been delayed, adding to worries that China‚Äôs floundering property market is impacting liquidity in the financial industry.



KBC Corporation disclosed in a Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) announcement (pdf) on Aug. 12 that it was missing a 60 million yuan ($8.22 million) payment on trust products from Zhongrong. Nacity Property Service, also listed on the SSE, made an announcement (pdf) the same day that a 30 million yuan ($4.11 million) payment was overdue. Xianheng International was the first to report missed payments (pdf) amounting to 2.57 million yuan ($352,000) as early as Aug. 8.

Zhongrong is partially owned by Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, a Beijing-based asset management conglomerate with stakes across China‚Äôs financial sector, including in trust companies, wealth management firms, and mining groups.

The National Financial Regulatory Administration, China‚Äôs banking regulator officially established in May, created a task force to investigate the risks of Zhongzhi‚Äôs financial situation. The company controls about 1 trillion yuan in assets ($138 billion), according to Use Trust data reported by the Washington Post.

The size of China‚Äôs shadow banking sector, which is about the same size as the UK‚Äôs economy in 2022.

Zhongrong‚Äôs troubles may be linked to China‚Äôs struggling property market

China‚Äôs real estate crisis, which began in 2020, only appears to be deepening‚Äîand is sparking fears of contagion. New home prices in China dropped in July for the first time this year, according to Reuters calculations, marking another grim sign amid a raft of gloomy economic data that Beijing released this week.

Last week, real estate giant Country Garden, which has been teetering on the brink of default, missed two bond payments worth $22.5 million. It now has a grace period of 30 days to make the repayment. Failure to do so could trigger a wave of defaults in the industry, and beyond, echoing the trouble at real estate giant Evergrande, which was declared to be in default in late 2021 and whose losses at the time were only revealed in filings released last month.

Zhongrong has historically had high exposure to the real estate market, which makes up, along with infrastructure spending, about 25% to 30% of China‚Äôs GDP. Of the trust firm‚Äôs 629 billion yuan ($86.2 billion) managed assets in 2022, 11% were in real estate, according to its annual report cited by Bloomberg. Zhongrong invested in at least 10 real estate projects last year, the South China Morning Post reported.

Economic trouble could mean social unrest‚Äîsomething Beijing is no stranger to when financial scandal hits. A couple dozen protesters were recently seen outside Zhongrong‚Äôs Beijing office demanding their payments, according to a video seen by Bloomberg report, in a rare show of public discontent. A Bloomberg reporter returned today (Aug. 16) and found no more demonstrators, but noted a higher police presence.

1,good,True,positive,12239,"WA reaches $10 million settlement with Tyson Foods in chicken price fixing. 

The settlement, announced Monday by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, is the third since Ferguson sued 19 chicken producers last year, accusing them of conspiring to drive up prices on everything from chicken nuggets to chicken breasts to Popeye‚Äö√Ñ√¥s chicken sandwiches.

Those 19 companies together represent 95% of the broiler chickens sold in America. 

The lawsuit alleged that the 19 chicken producers, beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2019, conspired in four ways to raise prices: They coordinated their output to reduce the supply of chickens available for sale.

Shares in Walt Disney, Peloton Interactive and some regional banks weighed on stock indexes Thursday, offsetting gains among most Big Tech firms after the U.S. economy showed fresh signs of cooling.

Weekly jobless claims ticked higher Thursday, while a Labor Department measure of producer prices notched its slowest rate of growth since January 2021, providing new evidence that inflation is slowing and the Federal Reserve may pause interest-rate hikes next month.

Still, major stock indexes wavered for most of the day and finished mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial fell 0.7%, or 221.82 points, while the S&P 500 edged down 0.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a 0.2% gain.

The quiet trading day continued a weekslong slow dance between markets and policy makers, as investors have parsed regulators‚Äô ability to contain banking-sector stress while curbing price increases for housing, services and more.

Thursday‚Äôs indicators of slowing inflation, which arrived a day after federal data showed consumer prices eased in April for the 10th straight month, would seem to provide a springboard for stocks to take off and sustain gains.

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no rest for the weary until that debt ceiling gets resolved,‚Äù said Karyn Cavanaugh, chief investment officer at Carolinas Wealth Management.

Amid ongoing talks in Washington on how the government can pay its bills and avoid a default, many investors have kept money on the sidelines of stock markets, instead earning income from Treasurys and money-market funds. Ms. Cavanaugh said the caution has held stock prices back despite corporate earnings in the first quarter largely exceeding Wall Street‚Äôs expectations.

‚ÄúI try to tell investors, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt try to Washington-proof your portfolio,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLet them play in their playpen.‚Äù

On Thursday, regional banks continued showing signs of strain. Shares of PacWest Bancorp fell 23%, dragging down other regional banks, after the Los Angeles-based lender disclosed another round of deposit flight.

The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index fell about 2.4% and shares of other regional banks including Zions, Comerica and Bank of Hawaii slid between 4.5% and 10%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase edged down 0.3%. Bank of America ticked 0.3% higher.

‚ÄúSome fear still surrounds the banking system,‚Äù said Thorne Perkin, president of multifamily office Papamarkou Wellner Perkin.

Other individual stocks also added downward pressure. Disney was the Dow‚Äôs worst performer, according to FactSet, trading 8.7% lower after the company reported that its Disney+ streaming service lost U.S. subscribers for the first time. Covid-era darling Peloton fell 8.9%, hitting a record low, after the company announced a recall affecting roughly 2.2 million bikes.

Most sectors of the economy have shown resilience in recent months, driving wage increases and pulling the unemployment rate to its lowest level since 1969. China‚Äôs re-emergence from strict lockdowns has also boosted demand for energy and consumer goods.

Shares in Tapestry, the parent of brands including Coach and Kate Spade, gained 8.3% after executives raised their earnings forecast and said luxury shoppers in Asia are spending big as the region reopens after the pandemic. Robinhood Markets shares rose about 6.4% after the online broker reported better-than-expected revenue and said it would launch 24-hour trading for select stocks and ETFs.

Much of Big Tech also continued this year‚Äôs upward climb after a rough 2022. Netflix rallied 2.8%, good enough for a seven-day winning streak, while Facebook owner Meta Platforms gained 1.2%. Amazon shares traded 1.8% higher and Google parent Alphabet rose 4.3%, completing its best two-day stretch since November, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Mr. Perkin, whose firm focuses on family offices, said he views such blue-chip tech stocks as an economic bellwether and believes the odds of a severe recession are shrinking.

Samsung is mulling a switch from Google to Microsoft‚Äôs Bing as the default search engine on its smartphones and tablets, the New York Times reported Sunday, putting a contract worth a reported $3 billion per year in jeopardy. Though that represents just over 1% of Alphabet‚Äôs roughly $280 billion in annual revenue, it‚Äôs the latest indication that Google‚Äôs search engine dominance may be fading, with the Times reporting there was ‚Äúpanic‚Äù among Alphabet employees over the Samsung contract. Alphabet shares slid as much as 4.1% in early trading Monday, shedding $57 billion in market capitalization, while Microsoft shares climbed 1.6%. That continues a months-long trend of Microsoft‚Äôs stock outperforming Alphabet‚Äôs, as Microsoft shares are up 21% since the November launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs viral chatbot incorporated into Bing; Alphabet shares are up 10% during the same period. Microsoft has an ‚Äúearly lead‚Äù in the artificial intelligence space as it exhibits a ‚Äúrenewed vigor‚Äù in the search market, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Kash Rangan wrote in a note to clients last month.

Microsoft announced in January it made a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, reportedly infusing $10 billion into the budding generative AI company and taking what will be a 49% stake in the firm. Just three weeks later, Microsoft rolled out its integration of ChatGPT into Bing and its Edge web browser. Bard, Google‚Äôs answer to ChatGPT, has received more lukewarm feedback, with Alphabet shares tanking 7% on February 8 after the chatbot provided inaccurate information during a demo.

Microsoft is the ‚Äúclear early leader‚Äù in the generative AI space and has ‚Äúpotential to achieve escape velocity‚Äù and separate itself from competitors, JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy wrote earlier this month.

20%. That‚Äôs roughly the proportion of the roughly 4.4 billion smartphone users worldwide that use a Samsung device, according to Counterpoint Research and GSMA Intelligence data.

According to Google's latest Chromium source code, a fresh ""Double Click Close Tab"" feature could make its way to users sometime in the near-future.

This latest addition will be a mouse input, reports suggest. By a double-click, users would be able to close active tabs quickly. For now, Chrome users may either use the ""X"" option to close active tabs or use the Ctrl+W shortcut on Windows.

This is among Google's latest coterie of features for Chrome. Recently, the US tech giant unveiled Memory and Energy Saver modes to actively reduce power consumption and improve Chrome browser's performance.

A report by Android Police that originated from Twitter user Leopeva64 first suggested that Google Chrome would let users close tabs with a double-click. This feature was spotted in the Chromium source code.

Google is still working on the feature so users would have to wait a little longer before they can use it. It should work how Microsoft Edge lets users close tabs by using the middle mouse button.

Recent updates to Google Chrome include the Memory Saver and Energy Saver modes we referred to above. These features were first rolled out in December, 2022 and may be accessed from the ""Performances"" tab on Chrome's sidebar. The Memory Saver feature prioritises active Chrome tabs and reduces memory usage by deactivating inactive tabs.

The Energy Saver add-on will save battery life of your system when you're using Chrome. These features are turned on by default and users can disable them from settings if they're not working as expected.

And many of those municipalities secured three-year contracts for electricity long before the war in Ukraine. Regulated investor-owned electric utilities, primarily Eversource and National Grid, need to buy power on behalf of their basic service customers twice a year in Massachusetts, and set rates accordingly.

Eversource last week unveiled plans to raise its electric supply rates by more than 40 percent as of Jan. 1 in Eastern Massachusetts, reflecting how the costs of producing electricity have skyrocketed in the last year. The main culprit: disruptions in worldwide supplies of natural gas, the most commonly used fuel for power plants in New England, following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Tens of thousands of Eversource customers in Greater Boston can find relief from rising electric rates this winter from an unexpected tactic: going green.

The end result: The green-power aggregation contracts that cities and towns have adopted in the past decade for environmental reasons are now often much cheaper than the basic service through the utilities.

‚ÄúFor a large number of communities, this is benefitting the ratepayer,‚Äù said Geoff Beckwith, head of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

Most residential customers in Boston were swept into the city‚Äôs municipal aggregation plan nearly two years ago. By default, city officials placed households into its standard plan, which gets 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources this year. (It needs to be 10 percentage points higher than the state mandate of 20 percent for Eversource and National Grid, a figure that rises every year.) Nearly two-thirds of electric customers in Boston, or about 200,000, get their power supplies via the city contract. The rest get Eversource basic service (about 80,000) or buy power from a third-party supplier and could potentially switch into the city‚Äôs plan.

Mayor Michelle Wu‚Äôs administration hopes to persuade more people to make the switch, in light of the upcoming rate hike, and to encourage those in the standard plan to ‚Äútrade up‚Äù to a ‚ÄúGreen 100‚Ä≥ plan for 100 percent renewable power.

The varying rates in Boston offer compelling examples of the potential savings.

Roughly speaking, the lowest-cost plan, with 20 percent renewable power, in the city‚Äôs ‚ÄúCommunity Choice Electricity‚Äù program, costs 10.8 cents per kilowatt hour, for the supply portion of the bills. That‚Äôs compared with 11.2 cents in the city‚Äôs standard plan, and 13.9 cents in ‚ÄúGreen 100.‚Äù Meanwhile, Eversource‚Äôs basic service charge is 17.9 cents for supply, a rate that‚Äôs scheduled to go up to 25.6 cents in January.

What does that mean for a typical house, using 600 kilowatt hours a month? The savings add up quickly: Eversource‚Äôs supply cost goes from $108 to $154 a month in January, for the next six months, while the cost for someone in the Boston plan ranges from $65 a month for the lowest-cost tier to $83 a month for an all-green plan, locked in until the end of 2023.

‚ÄúThere were a lot of times where people think green is going to cost more, but you could have 100 percent renewable energy for less than the 20 percent renewable energy that Eversource has in their supply,‚Äù said Mariama White-Hammond, Boston‚Äôs energy and environmental chief.

White-Hammond notes that consumers with Eversource‚Äôs basic plan can switch back and forth without a penalty, although it could take up to two months before that switch takes effect. She said she believes Boston‚Äôs rates will still likely be lower than Eversource‚Äôs when the utility‚Äôs supply rates change again in July, and when Boston goes out to bid again for a new contract for January of 2024.

‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre going after renewables, and renewables are now significantly cheaper than fossil fuels, we‚Äôre still likely to do better,‚Äù White-Hammond said. ‚ÄúThe worse that fossil fuels do, the more our rates will be competitive.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just Boston. In Newton, for example, the three tiers range from 10.6 cents to 14.4 cents per kilowatt hour ‚Äî or $64 to $86 for the typical home. Newton locked in its rates around the same time Boston did. Somerville, meanwhile, only just established a new three-year contract as of this month. But its rates, ranging from 14.9 cents to 18.6 cents, will all be cheaper than Eversource‚Äôs basic supply service come January.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty funny the way there was angst among some people about whether we can afford renewable energy,‚Äù said Larry Chretien, executive director of Green Energy Consumers Alliance. ‚ÄúThe virtue of aggregation, as I keep saying, is that the city of Boston ... had more flexibility than Eversource did. Eversource has to buy every six months, at a very specific moment.‚Äù

Edgar Dworsky, a Somerville resident who runs the website ConsumerWorld.org, advises consumers who want the best deal to avoid getting stuck with the default service offered by cities and towns and instead to look for the tier with the lowest price.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the middle of high inflation and people‚Äôs budgets are stretched,‚Äù Dworsky said. ‚ÄúCities had different goals. Their goal was to be more green. My goal as a consumer advocate and bargain hunter is to pay the least possible for electricity service. If that‚Äôs your goal, particularly with inflation the way it is now, you‚Äôve got to see what the actual cheapest rate is of the three plans they offer, versus whatever Eversource is offering.‚Äù

Stocks wobbled for much of Tuesday before sliding deeper into the red, as Wall Street followed last-minute talks to stave off a U.S. default that some investors fear would upend financial markets.

Losses across major indexes accelerated throughout the afternoon as the White House and congressional Republicans offered few hints of additional progress. The S&P 500 slipped by 1.1%, with losses spanning every sector except energy, while the Nasdaq Composite slid by 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%, or 231 points.

Trading has been relatively calm in recent days as the clock ticks toward the ‚ÄúX-Date‚Äù‚Äîas soon as June 1‚Äîwhen the government has warned it won‚Äôt have enough cash to pay its bills.

Many investors believe that Washington will produce an 11th-hour agreement to avoid a breach of the debt ceiling. But the growing potential of a default may also entice some stock traders to unload holdings in a bet the ‚Äúblack-swan event‚Äù shakes up markets, said Samuel Dedio, chief investment officer at Patrumin Investors.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an outside risk that this could happen, and there could be downside volatility in stocks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut the past is present, and they‚Äôve gotten deals done before.‚Äù

A greater fear for investors is how a default could disrupt repayment of Treasury debt, widely considered the safest securities in the world, and send ripple effects across the companies, money-market funds and individuals that invest in it to manage their cash.

That anxiety has warped short-term debt markets, propelling yields on Treasury bills that mature June 6 above 6% Tuesday. The government‚Äôs longer-term borrowing costs have also risen over the past week as investors have grown more skeptical that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates later this year if inflation eases.

Two-year Treasury yields, which are particularly susceptible to the near-term outlook for interest rates, rose to 4.333%. Dedio said he holds no bonds with a longer maturity window and that the weighted average maturity of his holdings is less than a year. Bond yields rise when prices fall.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of volatility in terms of what the Fed is going to do,‚Äù Dedio said.

As investors retreated from stocks on Tuesday, pandemic-era winner Zoom Video Communications was one of Nasdaq‚Äôs major losers. The teleconferencing software-maker fell 8.1%, even after posting better-than-expected earnings Monday, after releasing a dimming outlook for its enterprise segment.

Major technology stocks traded mostly lower, dragging down the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Microsoft slid 1.8%, while Google owner Alphabet slipped 2%. Facebook parent Meta Platforms dropped 0.6% and chipmaking giant Nvidia lost 1.6%.

Broadcom gained 1.2%, pushing its share price to a record high, after Apple said it would extend its supply agreement with the chip maker in a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal for wireless-connectivity and 5G radio-frequency and components. Apple shares, ticked 1.5% lower.

Cole Smead, chief executive officer of Smead Capital Management, said Tuesday‚Äôs close offered a snapshot of how he expects the market to perform the rest of the year: Tech companies weigh down U.S. markets, while oil helps investors and companies tied to it.

The average user is not aware that their pocket AI assistant can scan thousands of photos instantly and find old images with a few simple commands.

And these bots also make incredible PAs, bookmarking dates in your calendar and setting reminders for crucial meetings.

So, let's delve into the top voice commands for your smart assistant that can simplify your daily life:

Before we get started, to make your phone‚Äôs virtual assistant work better, be sure it truly understands your voice, tone and inflections. These common mistakes make it more complicated.

In dimly lit situations, such as trying to decipher a menu or navigating a hallway, the last thing you want is to struggle with your phone to locate the flashlight feature. Opt for a more straightforward solution: command your device using your voice.

Simply say: 'Turn on the flashlight.'

It works for both Siri and Google Assistant. Just say the wake name first to make sure they‚Äôre listening. You can tell your assistant to turn off the flashlight, too.

Here's a magical tidbit for all the Potterheads out there! You can channel your inner wizard by saying 'Lumos' to light things up, just like Harry and his friends would their wands.

And when you're done, a simple 'Nox' will send the light away. How's that for a spellbinding trick?

Tell your phone, 'OK, Google, show me pictures of (your pet's name).' Even if a pet isn't part of your household, this voice command has the power to navigate your photo gallery quickly.

On an Android, this trick works when you‚Äôve already backed up and organized your pictures through Google Photos. Attaching a name to the people and pets you photograph often makes it much easier to find them this way.

For Apple fans, Siri can delve into your Photos app and excavate pictures based on various parameters ‚Äî the names of individuals, activities, objects, dates, or even locations.

Now, take your photo searching to the next level.

Get fancy and combine parameters: 'Show me photos of Christmas 2019' or 'Show me photos of Ella from February at the beach'.

This voice command is as straightforward as it is invaluable: 'Hey Google, set a reminder...' or 'Siri, remind me...'.

After prompting your device, you tell it about the task you wish to be reminded of.

For example, if you have a phone call with Kim tomorrow at 2pm, say, 'Hey Google, remind me to call Kim at 2pm tomorrow'.

The reminder will then be set, enabling you to carry on with your day without fear of forgetting this important task.

Or perhaps you must remember to pick up a gallon of milk at the grocery store at 3pm Say, 'Siri, remind me to pick up milk at 3pm'.

Start using your digital assistant as your helper.

It's a familiar scenario: the children are peppering you with questions, persistently wondering, 'How much longer until Christmas?'

Fortunately, Siri or Google can swiftly come to your rescue.

All you need to do is ask, 'How long until (insert the desired date)?' It's simplicity personified.

This approach is versatile and can cater to a plethora of needs.

For example, you're planning a family getaway in a few months, and the excitement has led to a countdown.

Your digital assistant will readily provide the remaining days, taking the guesswork out of the process and enabling you to focus on planning that perfect vacation.

Many people don‚Äôt know that your voice assistant works with your applications.

If you're using an iPhone, activate Siri by saying, 'Hey Siri, launch (app name),' to access your desired app.

You can leverage this feature for more complex tasks, such as requesting a ride through Uber by stating, 'Hey Siri, get me a ride with Uber,' or making a payment on Venmo with 'Hey Siri, pay Sam $5 with Venmo.'

On an Android device, Google Assistant responds similarly to voice commands.

You can open apps by saying, 'Hey Google, open Dunkin Donuts.'For more advanced interactions, like placing an order, say, 'Hey Google, order coffee from Dunkin Donuts.'

Google Assistant can also help you track orders or play your favorite music with commands like, 'Hey Google, where is my Walmart order?' or 'Hey Google, play Frank Sinatra on Spotify'.

Android devices provide voice assistant support for numerous apps like Snapchat, Discord, Etsy, MyFitnessPal, Mint, Nike Adapt, eBay, Kroger, Best Buy, Postmates, and Wayfair.

Take advantage of your voice assistant, Siri or Google Assistant, to manage your calendar without manually opening your calendar app. They need information about the participants, date, and time.

Here's an example: instead of manually setting up a meeting, say, 'Hey Siri, set up a lunch meeting with Bob tomorrow at 1pm'. You can even detail your events further by instructing, 'Hey Google, add an event called ""Birthday Dinner"" this Sunday at 4pm and remind me to order an Uber home at 9pm'.

Remember, if you're maintaining multiple calendars, specify the target calendar during your command; otherwise, your event will default to your primary calendar.

Siri is designed to connect seamlessly with Apple's Calendar app. However, if you're a Google Calendar user on an Apple device, you'll need to add your Google Calendar with Apple's default app.

Silence your phone before you go into a church, start a meeting, or sit down for a job interview.

An easy way to do it is with your voice. Say, 'Siri, silence my phone' or 'Google Assistant, silence my phone.' Poof, gone are any potential distractions.

That wasn't for you

It's common to unintentionally summon your voice assistant with a word that closely resembles 'Siri' or 'Hey Google'.

The device, mistakenly believing it's been called upon, may start recording your speech, potentially leading to privacy concerns.

The good news is both Siri and Google Assistant audibly indicate when they are activated.

If you wish to stop Google Assistant from capturing the rest of your conversation, simply state, 'That wasn‚Äôt for you'. This command also erases the recent recording from your history.

If Siri is accidentally activated, you can use the exact phrase, 'That wasn't for you'.

It's important to note that while this will deactivate Siri, Apple hasn't officially confirmed whether this command also removes the last recording from its memory.

Andrew Watterson, the COO of Southwest, told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee the airline has since rebooked passengers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ flights at no extra cost, offered them rental cars and meals, processed refunds for unused flights and prioritized returning bags to proper owners, admitting, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫we messed up.‚Äö√Ñ√π Paul Hudson, president of the air travel advocacy group Flyers Rights, argued the airline‚Äö√Ñ√¥s use of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫unrealistic and deceptive scheduling‚Äö√Ñ√π is unacceptable, and suggested implementing delay compensation for passengers as well as a policy for airlines to match empty seats for passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled on other flights for no extra charge.

The government, which filed its lawsuit in the waning days of the Trump administration, has argued that Alphabet's Google acts illegally in paying billions of dollars each year to smartphone makers like Apple, LG, Motorola and Samsung, carriers like Verizon and browsers like Mozilla to be the default search for their customers.

Judge Amit Mehta actively questioned Google's lawyer, John Schmidtlein. Mehta pressed him, for example, on if being dominant in search means that Google's search engine will improve faster than its competitors. He also asked if the deals were ""anticompetitive"" and gave the company an advantage.

Google's Schmidtlein replied: ""Offering a superior product, winning business on the merits is never unlawful.""

""There is zero consumer harm here whatsoever,"" Schmidtlein told the judge at another point.

Google has argued in court filings that the payments at issue are legal revenue-sharing deals and not illegal efforts to exclude rivals.

The decision on summary judgment will be decided by Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case is slated for trial in September.

Google's motion is the Internet company's latest attempt to end several costly and time-consuming lawsuits from state and federal governments aimed at reining in its market power.

The Justice Department sued Google in 2020, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech since it sued Microsoft Corp for anti-competitive practices in 1998. A settlement left the company intact although the decision to rein in Microsoft left room for Google, which was founded in 1998, and others to thrive.

Since this lawsuit was filed, Google has been hit with other antitrust complaints. The Justice Department filed a second lawsuit in January accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business.

Alphabet (GOOGL) : Alphabet shares are slipping about 3% Monday afternoon after The New York Times reported Samsung is considering switching Google with Microsoft's Bing as the default search engine on its devices. Keep in mind that this could all be one big negotiation tactic on Samsung's end. According to the report, the deal between Samsung and Google is up for renewal soon and is estimated to be worth about $3 billion of revenue to Google. Why is Alphabet shedding about $50 billion of market cap today on a story about a revenue stream that brings in about $3 billion per year? It is confirmation that competition in the search industry is heating up, especially with more and more people interested in using AI chatbots. To be clear, we don't expect Alphabet's stronghold on the search industry ‚Äî and its more than 90% share of the industry, according to StatCounter ‚Äî to go away any time soon. Google search has become too ingrained in today's society. However, when you dominate such a large percentage of something, even a few-percentage-point loss can make a difference. That's what we are worried about. Further adding complexity to this story is Alphabet's current antitrust case with the Department of Justice . Given the mounting uncertainties facing the tech giant, it is only prudent to downgrade our rating to a 2 from a 1. This means we would rather be buyers on a pullback until we get more clarity into how the company will improve its AI positioning.

From the time of our February initiation to today, PANW was able to rally nearly 15% thanks to an explosive earnings-per-share beat and full-year outlook raise. This not only confirmed that security is one of the most resilient corners of technology spending, but also that Palo Alto was winning business as the cloud security market consolidates around fewer platforms. Management's disciplined approach to profitability was also cheered by the market as the company delivered its third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability and achieved GAAP profitability on a cumulative basis for the last four quarters. That makes PANW eligible for inclusion into the S & P 500. We expect Palo Alto's stock to get a big pop if and when it gets added to the index. Even though the stock has made a nice run this year, up 43%, there is still room to run here. We are increasing our price target to $230 from $200.

Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday unveiled what could be the biggest threat to Google‚Äôs (GOOG, GOOGL) search empire in years with the release of its new Bing search engine powered by OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT technology.

""It's a new day in search. It's a new paradigm for search,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during an unveiling event held at Microsoft‚Äôs Redmond, Washington campus. ""Rapid innovation is going to come. A race starts today in terms of what you can expect. We are going to move fast.""

But Google controls 93% of the marketplace compared to Bing‚Äôs 3%. So why bother starting a war? Simple: Microsoft wants a larger slice of the $570 billion digital advertising market. In 2022, the company saw $18 billion in ad revenue through search and LinkedIn. Google, meanwhile, pulled in $59 billion in Q4 alone.

To do that end, Microsoft has outfitted Bing with generative AI powered by a more advanced version of OpenAI‚Äôs popular ChatGPT chat bot. One example of how this comes into practical use is by searching for whether a new LG C2 TV will fit into a 2007 Ford Mustang, something I'm particularly interested in.

With traditional search, you‚Äôll get a list of websites or Reddit links related to the topic. But Bing will now pull out the relevant information including the dimensions of the TV and your trunk space to let you know if your new set will make it back home with you in one piece.

‚ÄúThis is a pretty significant paradigm shift in the way people look for and interact with information,‚Äù explained Gartner Analyst Ed Anderson. ‚ÄúMicrosoft is the first one to take the step.‚Äù

But Google isn‚Äôt sitting idly by while Microsoft steals the show, it is already pepping its own competing product called Bard. And getting people to abandon Google will be a Herculean task.

Google is synonymous with search. But the way Nadella tells it, the market has been more or less stagnant for the last 20 years. That‚Äôs where the new Bing comes in. By leveraging OpenAI, which Microsoft is investing billions of dollars in over a number of years, the company hopes to overpower Google.

While Bing still provides the familiar list of links you‚Äôd expect from a search engine on the left side of the screen, the right side now has OpenAI-powered generative AI answers to your queries.

Searching for things to do in Japan? You‚Äôll see a list of links for sites highlighting things to do on the left side and a conversational-style response from the AI-powered chat agent on the right, pointing out different events, locations, festivals, and more that you might want to check out.

It‚Äôs truly an impressive feature to see in person, and will certainly make searching online far easier than having to sort through a litany of sites or run through dozens of articles. And for Microsoft, that could be the secret ingredient to taking down Google.

‚ÄúIf what Microsoft has announced today reshapes what customers expect, and Microsoft is best able to deliver that, this will be a huge win for them,‚Äù Anderson explained. ‚ÄúWhat Microsoft has done here, I think puts them back in the game. I mean, they certainly weren't going to take any share with the existing offers.‚Äù

Microsoft doesn‚Äôt seem to have any misconceptions about its position in the market either. During a call with analysts, CFO Amy Hood pointed out that just 1 point of search advertising market share is worth $2 billion in annual revenue.

Microsoft meanwhile says its two year 2-year compound annual growth rate for search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC clocked in at 24%. And with the industry‚Äôs 3-year compound annual growth rate of 18%, the company sees space to grow.

Getting there won‚Äôt be easy

While Microsoft might have a first mover advantage by bringing generative AI to its search engine, there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll get consumers to switch to Bing en masse.

‚ÄúWe've seen incredibly disruptive technologies from ARM and AMD, and Intel still sits at 75 plus percent of the server market,‚Äù Futurum Analyst Daniel Newman explained. ‚ÄúWe're not going to wake up and all of a sudden an enhanced ChatGPT is embedded in Bing, and everybody's just gonna stop using Google.‚Äù

Google also has two distinct advantages over Microsoft outside of its ubiquity. Its Chrome web browser, which uses Google as its search engine by default, controls 65% of the global browser market, according to StatCounter. Microsoft‚Äôs Edge has just 4.5%.

What‚Äôs more, Google‚Äôs Android operating system controls a whopping 71% of the global smartphone market. And Google‚Äôs Chrome comes installed on the vast majority of those devices. As for Apple, its Safari browser, which comes built into all of its devices, uses Google search by default. Apple (AAPL) also uses Google as the default search engine for its Spotlight search as well.

We‚Äôre still waiting to see what a mobile version of the new Bing looks like, but Microsoft says it's coming.

Then there‚Äôs the lurking threat that Google is preparing its own ChatGPT-style interface. On Monday, the day before Microsoft‚Äôs announcement, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced that his company is working on a generative conversational AI called Bard that will be coming to Google search.

The company also has its own AI lab called DeepMind, which, like OpenAI, is considered one of the best such organizations in the world.

Still, Microsoft is making a compelling case for its new browser and the possibilities it holds. Now we‚Äôll just have to see if it pays off.

‚ÄúFor the first time, people could look at this and say, ‚ÄòThis is a better mousetrap, I'm going to use this‚Äô,‚Äù said Newman.

The company opened a CSE beta for Gmail and Calendar late last year, but now all organizations on a Google Workspace Enterprise Plus, Education Plus or Education Standard plan can enable the privacy protection feature. The option isn't available on personal Workspace plans or Google accounts just yet.

Although Workspace ""encrypts data at rest and in transit by using secure-by-design cryptographic libraries,"" CSE gives organizations total control over their encryption keys. ""Starting today, users can send and receive emails or create meeting events with internal colleagues and external parties, knowing that their sensitive data (including inline images and attachments) has been encrypted before it reaches Google servers,"" Google wrote in a blog post.

The Google parent has advised employees not to enter its confidential materials into AI chatbots, the people said and the company confirmed, citing long-standing policy on safeguarding information.

The chatbots, among them Bard and ChatGPT, are human-sounding programs that use so-called generative artificial intelligence to hold conversations with users and answer myriad prompts.

Human reviewers may read the chats, and researchers found that similar AI could reproduce the data it absorbed during training, creating a leak risk.

Alphabet also alerted its engineers to avoid direct use of computer code that chatbots can generate, some of the people said.

Asked for comment, the company said Bard can make undesired code suggestions, but it helps programmers nonetheless.

Google also said it aimed to be transparent about the limitations of its technology.

The concerns show how Google wishes to avoid business harm from software it launched in competition with ChatGPT.

At stake in Google‚Äôs race against ChatGPT‚Äôs backers OpenAI and Microsoft are billions of dollars of investment and still untold advertising and cloud revenue from new AI programs.

Google‚Äôs caution also reflects what‚Äôs becoming a security standard for corporations, namely to warn personnel about using publicly-available chat programs.

A growing number of businesses around the world have set up guardrails on AI chatbots, among them Samsung, Amazon and Deutsche Bank, the companies told Reuters.

Apple, which did not return requests for comment, reportedly has as well.

Some 43% of professionals were using ChatGPT or other AI tools as of January, often without telling their bosses, according to a survey of nearly 12,000 respondents including from top US-based companies, done by the networking site Fishbowl.

By February, Google told staff testing Bard before its launch not to give it internal information, Insider reported.

Now Google is rolling out Bard to more than 180 countries and in 40 languages as a springboard for creativity, and its warnings extend to its code suggestions.

Google told Reuters it has had detailed conversations with Ireland‚Äôs Data Protection Commission and is addressing regulators‚Äô questions, after a Politico report Tuesday that the company was postponing Bard‚Äôs EU launch this week pending more information about the chatbot‚Äôs impact on privacy.

Such technology can draft emails, documents, even software itself, promising to vastly speed up tasks. Included in this content, however, can be misinformation, sensitive data or even copyrighted passages from a ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù novel.

A Google privacy notice updated on June 1 also states: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt include confidential or sensitive information in your Bard conversations.‚Äù

Some companies have developed software to address such concerns.

For instance, Cloudflare, which defends websites against cyberattacks and offers other cloud services, is marketing a capability for businesses to tag and restrict some data from flowing externally.

Google and Microsoft also are offering conversational tools to business customers that will come with a higher price tag but refrain from absorbing data into public AI models.

The default setting in Bard and ChatGPT is to save users‚Äô conversation history, which users can opt to delete.

It ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù that companies would not want their staff to use public chatbots for work, said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft‚Äôs consumer chief marketing officer.

‚ÄúCompanies are taking a duly conservative standpoint,‚Äù said Mehdi, explaining how Microsoft‚Äôs free Bing chatbot compares with its enterprise software. ‚ÄúThere, our policies are much more strict.‚Äù

Microsoft declined to comment on whether it has a blanket ban on staff entering confidential information into public AI programs, including its own, though a different executive there told Reuters he personally restricted his use.

Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, said that typing confidential matters into chatbots was like ‚Äúturning a bunch of PhD students loose in all of your private records.‚Äù","Google warns staff about spilling secrets to Bard in race against ChatGPT, sources say",non-causal,"EU, US, CEO, AI","['PBM', 'CVS']",['CVS'],"['EU', 'AI', 'CEO', 'US']","['EU', 'CVS', 'CEO', 'PBM', 'AI', 'US']",-0.999708

There are five dangerous signs on Google Chrome that ""unwanted software or malware"" has been installed on your computer ‚Äì with potentially devastating consequences.

Hackers can use it to feed you with unwanted pop-up ads, earning a profit at your expense.

But they can also use it to spy on you.

That could result in you being defrauded, extorted, blackmailed or stalked.

It could even grant crooks access to your online accounts, and ultimately lead to your bank being emptied.

Once hackers have compromised your machine, it's important to act quickly.

Google revealed five warning signs that you might notice.

The first is unwanted pop-up ads and new tabs that appear ‚Äì and won't go away.

If your screen is constantly being bombarded with pop-ups, it's a giant red flag that malware has infected your device.

The second sign is that your Chrome homepage or search engine keeps changing without your permission.

A third red flag is that unwanted Chrome extensions or toolbars keep coming back.

Fourth on the list is that your web browsing is hijacked, with redirects to unfamiliar pages or ads.

And lastly, you may be getting alerts about a virus or warnings that your device is infected.

Google warned users to ""avoid unwanted software by only downloading files or visiting sites that you know are secure"".

If your device has compromised, you should uninstall or delete the unwanted programs or apps as soon as possible.

It's also worth going into your Chrome settings and tapping Reset Settings to restore them to their original defaults.

You can use your settings to block unwanted notifications from particular websites.

And if you're using Android, you can go to the Google Play Store menu, and look for Play Protect.

According to The New York Times, the company is in the early stages of creating a search service that will attempt to anticipate what you want from it in hopes of offering ‚Äúa far more personalized experience.‚Äù The project has ‚Äúno clear timetable.‚Äù However, knowing that Google is also developing a suite of new AI features for its existing search engine under the codename ‚ÄúMagi.‚Äù

Among the features Google is developing is a chatbot that can answer software engineering questions and generate code snippets. The company has also experimented with a feature that would allow people to search for music through a chatbot conversation. According to The Times, the company has assigned more than 160 employees to the redesign.

Other new additions ‚Äúin various stages of development‚Äù include a Chrome feature dubbed ""Searchalong."" It would allow a chatbot to scan the webpage you‚Äôre reading to offer contextual information. For example, if you were looking for a place to stay on Airbnb, you could ask the chatbot to tell you what to see and do near your planned accommodations. ‚ÄúGIFI‚Äù and ‚ÄúTivoli Tutor,‚Äù another pair of experimental features, would allow users to prompt Google Image Search to generate images and converse with a chatbot to learn a new language. It‚Äôs worth noting many of these are features that Google has either demoed in the past or exist on other platforms like Duolingo. For instance, image generation is already available in Slides.

Google reportedly plans to announce Magi next month before introducing additional new features sometime in the fall. That timing suggests the project will make an appearance at I/O 2023. The company plans to offer Magi‚Äôs features to one million people in the US before expanding availability to 30 million users by the end of the year.

The nearly 2,500 employees have since shifted to working at Google and weren't shy to start an email thread titled 'worked_at_amazon' to rant about the company's cheap mindset towards basic employee needs - despite Jeff Bezos being the world's second richest man.

In screenshots of the exclusive thread obtained by Insider, the employees revealed the company's pettiness calling it 'frupidity' and said they witnessed managers remove cereal boxes from company pantries in an attempt to install a 'frugal' outlook.

'Eventually, we got told, ""Spending a couple of hundred bucks on cereal isn't frugal. You are free to solicit donations to try and keep it running,""' one person wrote in the thread.

Some workers were told to split bagels because budget restrictions didn't allow for each person to get their own.

Another person said the company sold cups of noodles for a higher cost than a supermarket across the street.

A former longtime employee said Amazon has a reputation of being frugal that extends more than 20 years when managers removed pain killers and medications from the break room to save money.

While painkillers, bagels, and a cup of noodles are on the cheaper end of expenses, a former product manager said she had to beg the higher-ups to purchase her a new Apple MacBook instead of the basic Windows laptop employees received by default.

'I found it ridiculous because there's no joy in Windows laptops and when there's no joy, no creativity happens and when there's no creativity, what's a [project manager] worth?' the former employee wrote.

For those who needed an extra laptop charger, befriending the office supply manager was the way to do it, according to Insider.

Monitors were also hard for Amazon engineers to come by. One revealed his team was assigned only one monitor but needed a second to successfully complete their tasks.

To sneak another, the engineering team would recruit summer interns that would automatically receive a monitor from the company. Once the interns left, the monitors remained up for grabs.

'Pretty frupid to save $200 on something that could increase the productivity of an engineer you were paying six figures to,' the former engineer wrote.

Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president of 15 years, noted the term 'frupidity' as the company's 'frugal' outlook in saying no to excess purchase approvals.

Evans recalled his former boss purchasing his team coffee mugs with his own money due to the company's mindset that the cups wouldn't 'help customers.'

'A tight knit, successful team wanted coffee mugs for crying out loud,' Evans wrote in a blog post. 'This is a small, almost trivial cost. It would have been repaid literally 1,000 times if it helped retain or motivate one employee.

Amazon responded to the contention and said their leadership models 'frugality' as they encourage employees to be mindful of resources.

Amazon responded to the allegations, saying the company's 'frugality' model encourages employees to be mindful of resources.

'Our Leadership Principles describe how Amazon does business, how leaders lead, and how we keep the customers at the center of our decisions,' an Amazon spokesperson said.

'One of our Leadership Principles is ""frugality."" These anecdotes do not reflect its intention of encouraging employees to be mindful of how they use company resources and are contrary to our mission of being Earth‚Äôs most customer-centric company, safest place to work, and best employer.'

Bezos has a net worth of more than $145 billion - making him the second richest man alive behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk, according to Forbes.

Despite Bezos' wealth, the former Amazon employees that hopped over to Google - under CEO Sundar Pichai's leadership - noted their job change as a 'culture shock' and 'real breath of fresh air.'

Others said they've been treated better and had to 'unlearn' the norms from Amazon.

While new employees might be enjoying their new gig at Google, Pinchai, 55, hinted last week the tech company might lay off some employees due to lower ad and consumer spending.

Pichai said that the company has become 'slower' in productivity after hiring ballooned in the past five years, and that one way to make it more efficient was to merge competing products, like YouTube Music and Google Play Music.

In the last five years, Google has jumped from just under 100,000 full-time employees to over 150,000. In 2017, there were 80,110 full-time employees, 98,771 in 2018, 118,899 in 2019, 135,301 in 2020 and 156,500 in 2021, according to Macro Trends.

In total, Google added 76,390 jobs over five years, but Pichai is now saying the overgrowth in jobs has led to less efficiency.

Pichai added that when the company has fewer resources, it needs to make sure it is prioritizing on the 'right things to be working on', and workers are more 'productive'.

Although he did not explicitly mention layoffs, the company said in July that it couldn't 'be sure of the economy in the future' but it was 'not currently looking to reduce Google's overall workforce.'",Amazon employees complain the company is 'frugal' despite Bezos being world's second richest man,causal,CEO,"['A', 'US']",[],['CEO'],"['US', 'A', 'CEO', 'NEM']",-0.9988267

Duncan McCann, a staff member at child advocacy group 5Rights, filed the AADC complaint with the Information Commissioner‚Äôs office (ICO), asking the data watchdog to order Google to stop collecting children‚Äôs data and potentially fine it as much as 4% of annual turnover.

‚ÄúImagine YouTube as an adult stranger following your child ‚Äòonline‚Äô with a virtual clipboard recording everything they do,‚Äù McCann said in a statement. ‚ÄúThat is what is happening every day and they are not just doing it with your child. They are doing it with up to 5 million other UK children as well, resulting in an enormous amount of personal information being gathered.

‚ÄúNever mind it being against the law, it is a massive, unlicensed, social experiment on our children with uncertain consequences. YouTube should change the design of their platform and delete the data they have been gathering unlawfully from under 13s.‚Äù

Although YouTube officially bans children under 13 from using its main website, McCann‚Äôs complaint alleges the company has failed to ensure that younger children are following the rules and only using the main platform with parental consent.

A separate app, YouTube Kids, is available for children under 13 and has much stricter data processing, but data from the telecoms watchdog Ofcom shows that while YouTube, including YouTube Kids, was used by 89% of children between three and 17, only 40% of YouTube users aged three to four exclusively used the Kids app, with the proportion falling even lower for older children.

Beeban Kidron, the filmmaker and crossbench peer who founded 5Rights and pushed for the creation of the AADC, said she supported McCann‚Äôs complaint. ‚ÄúIt is well established that data privacy regimes are central to the safety of children online.

‚ÄúData law is not a pick and mix of what elements companies want to adhere to, it is a holistic approach that requires companies to offer children the highest degree of data privacy and in doing so lessen their exposure to harmful experiences and exploitation online.‚Äù

As well as asking for the data collected from children to be destroyed, the complaint also asks for the ICO to consider ordering the rollback or deletion of any machine learning system that has been trained on the gathered data.

A YouTube spokesperson said: ‚ÄúOver the years, we‚Äôve made investments to protect kids and families, such as launching a dedicated kids app, introducing new data practices for children‚Äôs content, and providing more age-appropriate experiences.

‚ÄúBuilding on that long-standing approach and following the additional guidance provided by the code, we implemented further measures to bolster children‚Äôs privacy on YouTube, such as more protective default settings and a dedicated YouTube Supervised Experience.

‚ÄúWe remain committed to continuing our engagement with the ICO on this priority work, and with other key stakeholders including children, parents and child protection experts.‚Äù

The AADC, also known as the ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Code‚Äù, has been internationally influential. After it came into force in the UK at the end of summer 2021, technology platforms including Instagram, TikTok and Snap all announced new policies to child users of their apps.

""We need to have guardrails,"" Arjun Narayan said. ""Without humans thinking through everything that could go wrong, like bias creeping into the models or large language models falling into the wrong hands, there can be very serious consequences for humanity.""

Narayan, who previously worked on Trust and Safety for Google and Bytedance, the company behind TikTok, said it is essential for companies to recognize opt-in and opt-outs when using large language models (LLMs). As a default, anything being fed to an LLM will be assumed training data and collected by the model. According to Narayan, many companies, especially new enterprises, should opt-out to avoid leaks and ensure confidentiality.

AI AROUND THE WORLD: HOW THE US, EU, AND CHINA PLAN TO REGULATE AI SOFTWARE COMPANIES

Additionally, Narayan said regulators should push for transparency around how the algorithm is trained. If the algorithm uses SmartNews data or data from another company, that company needs to know whether that is happening and if they will be compensated.

""You don't want the whole world to know what's your next product launch,"" he said.

As new applications for AI continue to develop, Narayan highlighted the need for increased media and consumer literacy. In the last few months, several countries, including China and Kuwait, have released AI news anchors that use natural language processing and deep learning to create realistic speech and movements to convey the news to their audience.

Narayan warned that scammers and other bad actors could exploit that technology to catfish people and get access to personal information. Such instances highlight the dissipating line between AI and human-generated media.

WHAT IS GOOGLE BARD? HOW THE AI CHATBOT WORKS, HOW TO USE IT, AND WHY IT'S CONTROVERSIAL

""This is kind of a fascinating space where, as long as the user knows they're making, who they're talking to and what's real, what's not real, I think that's okay. But if the user doesn't know, then we have a real problem on our hands,"" Narayan said.

He also spoke to several other use cases for AI in media and news. For example, a journalist could use AI for investigations or extracting data from existing data. Additionally, some companies have tasked AI with partial content writing, wherein the model creates a rough draft that is edited and published by a human.

Other companies, like SmartNews, use AI to curate and pick stories that matter to the user based on their unique signals and readership categories. Narayan said this recommender system process often uses an amalgamation of different algorithms for ""hyper-personalization.""

In extreme cases on social media, these filter bubbles, curated by AI, are dead set on the user's interests. Narayan used soda as an example of this process. Say a user likes soda. The AI would give the user soda regardless of whether that is good or bad. If the user keeps drinking that soda, the recommender system algorithms will continue to push that product. Narayan also noted that the long-term psychological implications of this type of model are unclear.

WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF AI? FIND OUT WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Narayan has spent years ensuring reputation and user safety are top priorities within the various organizations for which he has worked. A small subset of that responsibility includes evaluating fairness, accountability and bias. He stressed that humans set the AI model rules. If a company wants high-emotion stories for engagement, or high-crime stories, the system will pick just that.

""In some cases, obviously, the AI will optimize for engagement, but that also means that it will skew to certain types of stories,"" Narayan said. ""It'll set a certain tone for your platform. And I think a question worth asking is, ‚ÄòIs that is that the right tone for your media outlet? Is that the right tone for your platform?‚Äô I don't have an answer, but this is something where companies, editorial boards need to take ownership.""

Regarding ""robot reporters,"" or editors using AI to create content entirely, Narayan said that train has already left the station. A quick Google search finds that Amazon Books and online news platforms already have hundreds of pieces and novels written exclusively by AI.

At SmartNews, Narayan said AI is not used for fact-checking, not because they do not trust AI, but because there is not enough accuracy at this point. He added that a human element is needed to proofread the report's accuracy and ensure all the boxes related to journalistic values, diversity or political bias are checked.

""We have seen other platforms that claim to be completely digital and AI-driven, and that, as it may be, I don't think society is ready for that,"" Narayan said. ""AI is prone to errors. We still believe in human ingenuity, creativity and human oversight.""

While AI can sometimes be prone to quantitative errors, Narayan said the technology primarily works with accuracy. In his experience, AI has been extremely useful in conducting research, extracting facts and evaluating large datasets. However, since AI models are often trained with data from several years back, the models will be unable to answer questions about recent or current events. To that extent, the latency issue makes the model great for evergreen topics but inefficient when it comes to breaking stories, such as a recent mass shooting.

Narayan believes there should be certain ground rules for AI, such as a system to prioritize user transparency for readers to judge the material fairly. If AI fully wrote an article, there should be a way for the publisher to indicate that so the information can be passed down to the consumer.

""Either it's a digital watermark or a technology that cannot be misused,"" he said. ""And so that way, at least I know that this content was AI-generated or a student wrote an essay using ChatGPT and it has this watermark. So, it needs a professor who knows how to grade it and I think those things we definitely should insist on or at least push for in terms of regulation.""

US District Judge Amit Mehta said in his ruling, unsealed Friday, that attorneys general of Colorado and 37 other states who sued Alphabet for allegedly monopolizing the internet search and advertising markets failed to show the company damaged rivals like Yelp and Expedia.

Mehta ruled that the states‚Äô allegation pertaining to search results ‚Äúrelies not on evidence but almost entirely on the opinion and speculation of its expert.‚Äù

‚ÄúSimply put, there is no record evidence of anticompetitive harm,‚Äù the judge wrote.

Mehta, who was appointed to the DC federal court by Barack Obama, did allow the states and the Justice Department to proceed with sueing Google over contracts that it signed with Apple, Mozilla, and smartphone makers that preloaded its search engine into the devices, potentially stifling competition.

The antitrust case is set to go to trial on Sept. 12.

The Post has sought comment from Google.

News of Mehta‚Äôs ruling was reported by Bloomberg News.

The crux of the case against Google alleges that the company used ‚Äúexclusionary agreements‚Äù that denied their competitors access to search distribution.

Google is being accused of making deals with device manufacturers that require its search engine to be the default option on most mobile device while locking out rivals such as Microsoft‚Äôs Bing and DuckDuckGo.

Several antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Google in the US and Europe since 2020.

In January, the Justice Department partnered with eight states to file suit against Google for allegedly monopolizing the digital advertising market.

‚ÄúGoogle abuses its monopoly power to disadvantage website publishers and advertisers who dare to use competing ad tech products in a search for higher quality, or lower cost, matches,‚Äù the Justice Department said in its 149-page complaint filed in Virginia federal court.

Google responded to the lawsuit, saying the government was ‚Äúdoubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.‚Äù

Last year, Texas, Indiana, Washington State, and the District of Columbia sued Google over what they alleged was deceptive location-tracking practices that invade users‚Äô privacy.

Dozens of other states signed on to the lawsuit. Google eventually agreed to settle with 40 states by paying out $391.5 million.

In June, European Union regulators said Google may have to sell part of its lucrative adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices.

The European Commission set out its charges in a statement of objections to Google two years after opening an investigation into its business practices such as favoring its own advertising services, which could also lead to a fine of as much as 10% of Google‚Äôs annual global turnover.

Google said it disagreed with the Commission‚Äôs charge.

""I don't like this recession/no recession game. It's something that forces traders to choose a side,"" he said. According to Cramer, traders either think earnings will collapse for all companies, earnings will fall apart for everyone but the defensives, or they think large-cap tech stocks are poised for safety.



""Even though I try to be an elder statesman, I'm gonna be gratuitously dismissive of all three camps, because that's what they deserve,"" Cramer said.

The group expecting an earnings collapse might be right if there was evidence to support that beyond a simple drop in stock prices, Cramer said. He said those bank collapses could be the same as a 100 basis point rate hike, in terms of the effect it'd have on bank lending. That represents an opportunity to buy into economically sensitive stocks, Cramer argued, because it suggests the Fed is nearly done tightening rate hikes.

Cramer said the second set, defensive traders, are wrong because just a few weeks ago the defensive pharma and packaged goods names were being ""pummeled"" because they were perceived as too defensive. ""It's ridiculous,"" Cramer said, that those traders think the outlook is much improved.

Traders who want to run back to large-cap technology stocks have a ""harebrained idea,"" Cramer said. There's no rationale to buy a company like Google simply because of a strong balance sheet amidst a lending crisis, when as CNBC reported it's cutting expenses like staplers and laptop refreshes.

The Biden administration agreed not to extend the three-year moratorium on payments as part of the debt ceiling deal it cut with Republicans, so the almost 27 million borrowers who have a total of $1.1 trillion in student loans in forbearance will need to resume servicing them starting on Oct. 1. The US Supreme Court threw out the president‚Äôs plan to forgive up to $20,000 per borrower on June 30, closing down another potential avenue for relief for those who qualified.

Analysts at Wall Street banks project the restart will further crimp consumer spending, which is already showing signs of stalling‚Äîbut not enough to tip the economy into recession.

A March report from Jefferies drew a comparison with the 2013 fiscal cliff, when the end of a holiday on federal payroll taxes reduced US households‚Äô buying power. The topic has also surfaced during some company earnings calls. ‚ÄúWe are closely watching emerging challenges to consumer spending and sentiment, such as the end of fiscal stimulus and the resumption of student loan payments,‚Äù Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. Chief Executive Officer Rosalind Brewer told investors on June 27.

The restart of payments‚Äîwhich average about $400 a month‚Äîwill force many borrowers to make tough choices on how to allocate their spending. Analysts expect to see more households falling behind on credit card and auto loan payments in the final quarter of 2023. ‚ÄúPeople have not had to prioritize student loan payments for the last three years,‚Äù says Sarah Wolfe, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. Now they ‚Äúare going to have to rethink, ‚ÄòOK, do I pay my phone bill first, or my credit card bill first, or my student loan bill, or my mortgage?‚Äô‚Äù

Shanna Schultz of Albuquerque owns a home and a car and has what she describes as a good job as an urban planner with the city government, but debt is an unending source of stress for her. Her monthly payment will soon be about $700 on the $60,000 in federal loans she took out in the course of earning her undergraduate and two graduate degrees. During the pause, she was able to pay off some of her credit card debt and part of her car loan‚Äîand even put away some savings. Now she‚Äôs worried that she‚Äôll fall behind again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposedly living the American dream over here,‚Äù says Schultz, 33. ‚ÄúBut it certainly doesn‚Äôt feel that way.‚Äù

Economists at Bank of America Corp. expect student loan delinquencies to return to pre-pandemic levels once the pause expires‚Äî11.1% of borrowers were more than 90 days past due in the fourth quarter of 2019‚Äîwhich would amount to $167 billion worth of new seriously delinquent balances. Borrowers who are more than three months past due are considered at high risk of defaulting.

Many borrowers have already begun adjusting their spending. Morgan Stanley expects most of the money for student loan bills will come from a reduction in discretionary spending rather than savings. Its economists see personal consumption expenditures and overall gross domestic product ending the year about 0.1% lower than if payments remained frozen.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs already this kind of backdrop in which we had the consumer losing momentum in the fourth quarter and turning negative in the first part of next year,‚Äù says Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. ‚ÄúStudent loan resumption isn‚Äôt the sole catalyst for that, but to an extent, it can be seen as kind of the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. It‚Äôs just one more thing straining households when they‚Äôre already stretched pretty far.‚Äù

John McCullough, who works in IT in Alexandria, Virginia, recently moved into a cheaper apartment and got a roommate to free up money for his upcoming $400 monthly student loan payment. The 31-year-old graduated from Longwood University in Virginia in 2015 with about $31,000 in federal loans. He was making progress on paying down the balance until he lost his job in September 2020. Although he‚Äôs now employed, he also plans to cut back on social activities with friends and more carefully budget his grocery shopping.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge swath of the population that is just shackled to the economic floor because they have to make these payments each month,‚Äù he says.

Megan McCarthy, 35, of Oneonta, New York, who works in her county‚Äôs social services department, used to take a trip to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania with her daughter every year. With the resumption of student loan payments in mind, she skipped it this year. Her $80,000 in federal loans are ‚Äúscary‚Äù when she thinks about the future, especially in regard to sending her daughter, now age 9, to college.

‚ÄúWe used to take staycations at the hotel in our town just to swim at the pool, but we haven't been able to do little things like that,‚Äù McCarthy says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the talent, time or energy for a side hustle to make more money. I‚Äôm exhausted by the time I get home, and then I have to help with homework and do dinner.‚Äù

Borrowers whose relatives count on them for financial support are worried not just for themselves but also for their families. As the oldest child, Julian Galette in Philadelphia helps his parents buy groceries and makes sure their bills are paid on time. When his little sister needs gas for her car, she comes to him. The 33-year-old freelance writer has about $75,000 in loans from his undergrad degree and graduate degree in theology and expects to pay about $325 a month when payments resume. He‚Äôs already planning to cut out vacations, meals at restaurants and Uber rides, but he‚Äôs still concerned about being able to help his younger siblings and aging parents.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather set aside an extra $300 to help my family than for student loans,‚Äù Galette says. ‚ÄúI just plan on making the most minimal payments I can make. Everything costs almost twice what it did last year.‚Äù

Jon Paul, a 37-year-old freelancer in entertainment media in Los Angeles, has accumulated about $204,000 in federal loans from undergraduate, master‚Äôs and doctorate degrees and is enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. With another $200 monthly bill set to return, Paul, who uses the pronoun ‚Äúthey,‚Äù is planning to take on additional gigs to supplement their budget. But Paul‚Äôs biggest concern is no longer being able to help relatives with bills: ‚ÄúI was looking at my bank account this morning and thinking I need to tighten stuff up. If my mom or brother needs help, it may take me a minute.‚Äù

The reduction in roles is probably higher given many tech companies have not been replacing staff members who have resigned.

Atlassian‚Äôs cuts come just months after a recruitment drive, showing the volatility of a sector that tends to record extraordinary growth and sharp pullbacks, depending on economic conditions.

Many tech companies recorded strong growth throughout the three pandemic years, as consumers bought gadgets, binge-watched streaming services and had web meetings with colleagues.

‚ÄúThe tech sector got an incredible boost and they went on a hiring spree,‚Äù said Dr Nathalie Collins, a senior lecturer at Edith Cowan University‚Äôs business and law school.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a normalisation and a market correction and they are going back to delivering on their core businesses.‚Äù

Atlassian‚Äôs business is tightly linked to the broader health of the economy given the business-focused nature of its software.

The changes, described in the memo as a ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù, largely affect talent acquisition, program management and research roles, the company said.

While many technical staff have been affected by recent sector cuts, non-tech roles like human resources divisions have also been targeted.

Atlassian said the cuts were not a reflection of its financial performance and it said it would reinvest in priority areas.

The company‚Äôs share price is down more than 60% from its record high in 2021. Shortly before that, it announced plans to construct the world‚Äôs tallest hybrid timber tower, located next to Sydney‚Äôs Central Station, which is now under construction.

Upbeat economic data couldn't overcome the resistance stocks faced from disappointing corporate performance and persistent banking fears.

First, the promising news (at least when it comes to inflation). April's wholesale prices in the U.S. rose 0.2% for the month, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 0.3%. That translates to a 2.3% year-over-year increase, down from March's 2.7% and the lowest since January 2021. In another sign inflation might be coming under control, initial jobless claims increased by 22,000 to 264,000 for the week ended May 6, according to the Department of Labor. That's the highest reading since Oct. 30, 2021.

But that news didn't shield markets from other fears. ""Investor focus is now on both the economic backdrop and liquidity and what's going on versus rates and inflation,"" said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer of Certuity.

And liquidity ‚Äî or, in other words, the health of banks and their willingness or ability to make loans ‚Äî was in focus again Thursday. PacWest shares tumbled, along with other regional banks like Zions Bancorp, which lost 4.5%, and KeyCorp, which fell 2.5%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF slid 2.5% Thursday.

Another big loser on Thursday was Disney, which sank 8.7% after the media giant reported it had lost subscribers from its Disney+ streaming service. That's the largest one-day fall, in percentage terms, since Nov. 9, when the company slumped 13%.

Disney's shares dragged down both the S&P 500, which declined 0.17%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which slid 0.66%. However, the Nasdaq Composite managed to add 0.18%. The tech-heavy index was boosted by a 4.3% jump in Alphabet shares, which are trading at their highest level since August, thanks to investors' optimism around the artificial intelligence products the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference.

After a heavy week of economic data releases, investor focus will turn to the looming debt ceiling in the U.S. Unease over a potential sovereign default has already spread through markets. For instance, yields for short-term T-bills have jumped sharply this month. Still, most economists and bankers ‚Äî including JPMorgan CEO Dimon ‚Äî expect the U.S. to avoid defaulting. It's hard to imagine what would happen if they were proved wrong.

Corporate borrowers will have to pay more of that debt back as refinancing grows more difficult with rising interest rates. The persistent squeeze from inflation is keeping costs high for many companies while stifling consumer demand and sapping purchasing power.

Corporate debt rose from roughly $16.3 trillion just before the pandemic hit to about $19.8 trillion near the end of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve. Economists and analysts expect some kind of recession to hit the U.S. economy in 2023 and the severity of it could weigh heavily on both large and small companies as they repay debt.

‚ÄúFaced with an overhang of pandemic-era debt that begins to mature in 2025, companies will be looking for refinancing opportunities,‚Äù S&P Global Ratings said.

Refinancing risks are increasing partly because of the potential for a recession. Credit rating trends are already turning negative, with more downgrades than upgrades on debt since August. It all adds up to default risks rising as companies get pinched by a weakening economy and have a difficult time refinancing existing debt.

The Federal Reserve has sharply raised its benchmark interest rate in an effort to tame inflation, but that has made borrowing more expensive. The rate is currently in a range of 4.50% to 4.75% after starting last year at basically zero. The widespread expectation is now for the Fed to increase the rate to at least 5.25% by June and some bets on Wall Street are calling for a rate of up to 5.50%.

The tougher financing atmosphere is running up against an economic slowdown. Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet, Dell and other big technology companies have been cutting staff in an effort to control costs as demand wanes. Retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, have been issuing warnings about weaker consumer spending.

‚ÄúMany companies will find it more difficult to balance still-elevated input costs and waning demand amid the prospects of a downturn in the world‚Äôs largest economy,‚Äù S&P Global Ratings said.

The broader labor market has remained relatively strong, but a downturn in employment could further weaken consumer spending and hit corporate earnings. Companies in the S&P 500 reported a broad 4.6% contraction in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2022 and analysts expect similar results during the first half of 2023.",Corporate borrowers squeezed by rising rates,causal,,[],[],[],['AAL'],0.9992537

U.S. inflows from individual traders hit their highest in three months last week, averaging at $1.36 billion per day, Vanda Research said in a note on Thursday.

After buying U.S. stocks at a record pace in the first quarter of 2023, retail investors had retreated to the sidelines amid turmoil in the banking sector, high interest rates and fears of a recession.

But the passage of a U.S. debt ceiling deal last week helped stave off a devastating default and empowered markets to break out of a range and move higher.

""Following the debt ceiling agreement, risk-on sentiment seemed to have returned to the retail investor base this past week as we witnessed bullish flows across the ETF, single stock, and options space, mainly benefiting technology names,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Peng Cheng said.

Net retail purchases over the past week were the highest in Tesla (TSLA.O) , Apple (AAPL.O) , Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) , in that order, Vanda data showed.

Retail trading accounted for up to 17% of the U.S. total this week, the highest in a month and up from 14% in the prior week, according to J.P.Morgan data.

That coincides with the benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) climbing 20% above its bear market low in October and Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index (.VIX) , slumping to its lowest since before the pandemic.

A drastic uptick in retail buying has likely helped fuel a short squeeze in small-caps as well, Vanda Research analysts said.

The small-cap index Russell 2000 (.RUT) has advanced 7.5% in June, well ahead of the benchmark S&P 500's 2.7% gain.

""It will take more than just a short squeeze for buying to sustain at these levels, especially as retail investors have only just started to rebuild conviction in the markets,"" the Vanda analysts added.

Shares of Microsoft were up about 1%.

Google pays billions of dollars every year to phone manufacturers, including a reported $20 billion annually to Apple, to serve as the default search engine. In return, the search company reaps billions of dollars worth of advertising, which has long been a profit center for Google.

Samsung and Google's deal is up for renewal soon, the Times reported, and is worth an estimated $3 billion in revenue to Google. Samsung is a major Android manufacturer, and the news that Samsung would consider a switch reportedly surprised Google employees.

""Wow, OK, that's wild,"" one Google worker reportedly responded to the news.

Google has more than a 90% share of the search market, according to StatCounter, and is in the middle of a contentious battle with the Department of Justice over its search dominance. The DOJ has fixated on Google's apparent pay-to-play model, noting that paying to maintain default status has ""harmful effects on competition and consumers.""

Microsoft's Bing has languished for years behind Google. But Bing saw a surge of interest with the launch of its AI chatbot, which relies on OpenAI's GPT model. CNBC previously reported on how the launch of both Bing Chat and OpenAI's ChatGPT spurred Google into an all-hands ""code red"" response.

Samsung and Microsoft have an established partnership. Microsoft's Office apps are preloaded on Samsung phones, for example, and Samsung phones have built-in software that makes it easier to connect them to Windows computers.

It isn't clear if Microsoft would be willing to pay the same price that Google would. Microsoft relies far less on search and advertising and derives a significant amount of its revenue from cloud and enterprise solutions.

Samsung's reported reassessment may be a moot point, however, as Google looks to integrate Bard into search as soon as the fall.

Suwon-based Samsung, the world‚Äôs leading smartphone maker, is considering making the switch, putting at risk roughly $3 billion in annual revenue for Google, the report said. Bing‚Äôs threat to Google‚Äôs search dominance has grown more credible in recent months with the addition of OpenAI‚Äôs technology to provide ChatGPT-like responses to user queries.

Samsung shipped 261 million smartphones in 2022, according to IDC data, all running Google‚Äôs Android software. The Korean company has long-established partnerships with both Microsoft and Google, and its devices come preloaded with a library of apps and services from both, such as OneDrive and Google Maps. Negotiations are still ongoing and Samsung may yet decide to keep Google as its default provider, according to the report.

Google is working on several projects to update and renew its search services to avoid losing ground. Those include adding artificial intelligence features to its existing offerings, under a project named Magi, which has more than 160 people working on it, the Times reported.

Google is ‚Äúexcited about bringing new AI-powered features to search and will share more details soon,‚Äù Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. A Google representative did not comment on the company‚Äôs negotiations with Samsung. A representative from Samsung declined to comment.

Between its Samsung deal and one with Apple Inc., which the Times report valued at roughly $20 billion in annual revenue, the Mountain View, California-based search provider has commanding market share in mobile devices in the US and much of the rest of the world.

Large language models, such as the one underpinning ChatGPT and the chatbot functionality in Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, are not new to Google. The company has been using LLMs to anticipate the intent of users‚Äô queries, Google‚Äôs chief business officer said on the company‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings call in February.

Supporters of efforts to revamp antitrust laws, as well as update kids‚Äô online safety regulations, hoped to add such measures to the omnibus funding bill in a last-ditch effort to pass them this year, but a swath of tech bills were left out, according to text released early Tuesday.

A couple of less controversial antitrust reform bills, including one to update merger filing fees and another to let states choose the venue for antitrust enforcement cases, made it into the text. But on the whole, the multi-year bipartisan effort to reform competition bills to target tech giants appears to have failed as the current Congress winds down.

Supporters had been pushing for two other antitrust bills, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which aims to limit tech companies from preferencing their own products and services, and the Open App Markets Act, which aims to impose additional regulations on dominant app stores. The proposals came out of a House Judiciary Committee investigation into the market power of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, now under the parent company name Meta.

Both of the bills advanced out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with bipartisan support, but appear to be falling by the wayside without coming up for a vote on the floor of either chamber as the 117th Congress comes to a close.

The Open App Markets Act particularly faced a last-minute opposition push from the tech industry. The Chamber of Progress, which names Apple, Google, Meta and Amazon as corporate partners, launched an ad on connected TV earlier this month slamming the bill over accusations that it would ‚Äúforce companies to provide a soapbox to dangerous extremists.‚Äù

Supporters of the antitrust bill said accusations like the one Chamber of Progress pushed were red herrings and not an accurate portrayal of the legislation.

Although the antitrust bills had support on both sides of the aisle, House Republicans set to take control next year have set their sights on prioritizing content moderation concerns. The focus of top House GOP members like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is slated to chair the Judiciary Committee next year, on allegations of anti-conservative ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù will likely push the antitrust bills to the back burner.

In addition to antitrust reform, there was bipartisan support in Congress this year for efforts to improve kids‚Äô online safety laws. Two bills in particular, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) 2.0, gained steam. The bills advanced with bipartisan support out of the Senate Commerce committee.

Parent advocates whose children‚Äôs deaths were tied to social media met with lawmakers throughout the past couple of months in a last-minute push to pass the bills. But they ultimately failed to make it into the omnibus spending bill.

KOSA in particular faced an opposition campaign near the end of the year from a group of human rights and LGBTQ organizations, as well as the Center for Democracy and Technology, who argued that the bill would actually make kids less safe online and disproportionately harm marginalized youth.

But parent advocates who spoke to members of Congress, as well as kids‚Äô safety groups such as Fairplay and ParentsTogether, said the proposal would make the internet safer for kids by adding new requirements for how companies treat young users.

KOSA would create a duty of care for social media platforms to prevent and mitigate harm to minors, and require them to put the strictest privacy settings in place as the default for such users.

COPPA 2.0 would update the 1998 children‚Äôs privacy law to include protections for minors aged 12-16, who are not covered by the existing law. It would also add new protections such as a ban on targeted advertising to minors.

Some less controversial tech bills did make it into the omnibus text, including two of the antitrust proposals spawned by the House investigation. The spending bill includes the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, which would update filing fees to increase them for larger deals, and the Venue for State Antitrust Enforcement, which would allow states to choose where antitrust cases are heard, including cases that are pending by the date of the bill being enacted.

The INFORM Act, which aims to verify the identity of online sellers on virtual marketplaces, is also included in the bill.

""It doesn‚Äôt really matter that much,"" Dimon said during an interview with CNBC in Bozeman, Mont. ""It's the markets that decide, not the ratings agencies that make these big decisions.""

Fitch lowered the US government's top credit rating Tuesday from AAA to AA+, citing fiscal and political instability, sending stocks lower on Wednesday.

The timing of the move puzzled economists and investors.

‚ÄúWhy now?‚Äù Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens‚Äô College, Cambridge University and an economic advisor to Allianz, told Yahoo Finance Live. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the reason, you scratch your head.‚Äù

The downgrade also drew an angry response from the Biden administration, with the Treasury Department calling it ""arbitrary"" after the White House and Congress averted a debt default more than two months ago by raising the debt ceiling.

Dimon, who is in the midst of a countrywide bus tour visiting clients and bank branches, told CNBC the US ""should get rid of the debt ceiling"" but emphasized that the credit of the US is ""sound"" and ""should be the highest rated credit in the world.""

It is ""ridiculous"" that countries such as Canada have higher credit ratings, he added. ""This is the most prosperous nation on the planet. It's still the most prosperous nation on the planet.""

Bank stocks did not shrug off the US debt downgrade Wednesday. JPMorgan as well as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell between 1 and 1.6% Wednesday while the KBW Nasdaq bank index fell 1.1%.

Banks are one of the largest holders of US Treasuries. If the value of those Treasuries declined significantly, bank assets values would also drop.

They are highly incentivized by regulators to hold Treasuries because those assets are considered safer than other bonds. The good news is that they don't have to hold more capital if they own AA+ bonds as opposed to AAA.

As the takedown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon weighs on U.S.-listed Chinese stocks and President Biden prepares to deliver his State of the Union address, here's what you need to know from Washington, D.C., this week:

President Biden's decision to shoot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over the weekend has brought U.S.-China tensions to the forefront of Washington politics.

Chinese officials claimed the balloon was used for ""mainly meteorological"" purposes; however, reports of another balloon over Latin America have raised questions about China's capabilities for surveillance and espionage.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Republicans criticized Biden for not shooting down the balloon earlier and are reportedly considering passing a resolution that would condemn Biden's handling of the situation.

Democrats have pushed back and suggested that Republicans are placing too much emphasis on playing politics instead of uniting to counter China on the situation. Republicans and Democrats have sought to make strategic competition with China a nonpartisan issue, notably through McCarthy's decision to create a China commission.

The escalating tensions resulting from the balloon situation also prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel his planned trip to China. Meanwhile, China has criticized Biden's decision to shoot down the balloon, and it remains unclear how America's strategic partners will interpret the incident.

Biden is expected to address the China challenge, among other issues, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.

Investors will be watching for clues about whether Biden will implement additional sanctions and trade controls in response to China's actions. Biden is also expected to urge Congress to continue its support for Ukraine as some Republicans have begun to question the U.S.'s long-term financial commitment to the country.

Domestically, Biden will likely outline a vision for the nation's economy at a time in which strong jobs data have stoked investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates to combat inflation.

It's also worth noting that Biden's State of the Union Address will be interpreted as an opening bid to a potential reelection campaign. Although television viewership has declined in recent years, the State of the Union still provides one of the largest collective audiences for a White House occupant.

The debt ceiling stand-off continues to play out.

Speaker McCarthy's meeting with Biden last week at the White House seemed to indicate that both sides are willing to raise the debt ceiling before the U.S. defaults on its debt, which is expected to take place by the end of the summer or early autumn.

Although no agreement has been reached yet, McCarthy told conservative media outlets after the meeting with Biden that he remains optimistic that he'll be able to get Democrats to concede on making spending cuts to government programs.

But that will be a tough sell for Democrats ‚Äî particularly progressives, who will be pressuring Biden as a new election cycle inches closer.

Google went into a ""panic"" after Samsung, the world's second-largest manufacturer of smartphones and a user of the company's Android operating system, said it was considering offering Bing as the default search engine for users, according to a report published by the New York Times on Sunday.

The tech giant is scrambling to catch up to rivals Microsoft in the adoption of A.I. services. The threat to Google's $162 billion business is reportedly pushing the company to revamp its search products, including creating an entirely new A.I.-powered search engine.

Google's drive to compete contrasts with comments from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in an interview, also aired on Sunday, in which he suggested that he wanted to avoid a rush to release new A.I. products for fear of how they might affect society.

In the interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai called artificial intelligence ""the most profound technology humanity is working on,"" continuing that it was ""more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we‚Äôve done in the past.""

On 60 Minutes Sunday, Google executives demonstrated how to use its Bard A.I. to summarize the New Testament, and expand the famous six-word short story ‚ÄúFor sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.‚Äù

Yet the demonstration on Sunday also revealed A.I.‚Äôs continued struggle with ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù‚Äîthat is, moments when the model generates details that don‚Äôt exist in reality. On CBS, Google senior vice president James Manyika asked Google‚Äôs A.I. to answer a question on inflation. The program recommended five books that, on further review by CBS, did not exist.

Pichai dismissed the issue of hallucinations. ‚ÄúNo one in the field has yet solved the hallucinations problem. All models do have this as an issue,‚Äù he told CBS.

Google‚Äôs first demonstration of its Bard program in February also featured an incorrect answer to a question, leading shares to plunge and erasing $100 billion in market value. (Alphabet shares have since recovered.)

Both Bing and OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT have also made up specific details, or delivered strange and unsettling responses after extended interactions.

Google has been slower in embracing A.I. than its competitors. Microsoft is already integrating ChatGPT-like A.I. into its Bing search engine, and is continuing to roll out A.I. services across its many products.

On Sunday, Pichai suggested that Google was being cautious about rolling out more advanced A.I. to ensure that society could adapt to the new technology.

Some leaders in the tech sector, like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Stability AI founder Emad Mostaque, have called for a six-month moratorium on training A.I. models more powerful than OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4, released in mid-March. In response, Eric Scmidt, Google‚Äôs former CEO, argued that such a pause would ‚Äúsimply benefit China.‚Äù

Pichai told CBS that society needs ‚Äúregulations to think about how to adapt‚Äù to A.I. He also suggested that he wanted to avoid a race, ‚Äúwhere people working on [A.I.] across companies get caught up in who‚Äôs first, that we lose the potential pitfalls and downsides to it.‚Äù

Yet, internally, Google may be more worried about competition than its leaders might publicly admit.

The company was spooked in March by the possibility that Samsung, the world‚Äôs largest smartphone brand and a user of Google‚Äôs Android operating system for its phones, was considering removing Google as its default search engine, according to the New York Times.

The news that Samsung might look elsewhere for search sent the company into a ‚Äúpanic,‚Äù according to internal documents seen by the New York Times, and employees were quickly tasked with putting together a pitch document for Samsung.

Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to internal documents, Google is developing an entirely new A.I. search engine, named ‚ÄúMagi,‚Äù that would offer a more tailored experience to users, reports the New York Times. The company is also planning to add A.I. services to its existing search engine, and reportedly expects to release these tools for public use next month.

Google did not immediately respond to Fortune‚Äôs request for comment made outside of U.S. business hours. The company told the New York Times that ‚Äúnot every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch,‚Äù but that it was ‚Äúexcited about bringing new A.I.-powered features to search.‚Äù

The government, which filed its lawsuit in the waning days of the Trump administration, will likely defend its complaint, which said that Alphabet's Google acts illegally in paying billions of dollars each year to smartphone makers like Apple, LG, Motorola and Samsung, carriers like Verizon and browsers like Mozilla to be the default search for their customers.

Google has argued in court filings that the payments are legal revenue-sharing deals and not illegal efforts to exclude rivals.

The case is being heard by Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case is slated for trial in September.

Google's motion is the Internet company's latest attempt to get out of several costly and time-consuming lawsuits from state and federal governments aimed at reining in its market power.

The Justice Department sued Google in 2020, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech since it sued Microsoft Corp for anti-competitive practices in 1998. A settlement left the company intact although the decision to rein in Microsoft left room for Google, which was founded in 1998, and others to thrive.

Since this lawsuit was filed, Google has been hit with other antitrust complaints. The Justice Department filed a second lawsuit in January accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business.

Built on the Kabbage platform, which American Express acquired in 2020, Business Blueprint features cash flow insights and a way to buy digital financial products, such as a line of credit, from American Express.

‚ÄúHistorically, small businesses have been underserved when it comes to smart, simple financial management tools, said Alenka Grealish, principal analyst for emerging tech at Celent. Now a few financial institutions are reinventing small business banking and delivering needed tools, she added.

Her December 2020 report, ‚ÄúReinventing Small Business Banking‚Äù, shows it was even then a crowded field of innovation with companies like Square, Stripe, Amazon, Shopify and Intuit Quickbooks offering merchant payment services and analytics both directly and with partners.

Although her list of innovators is made up of fintechs she predicts that the winners in small business banking services will be banks which work with partners. American Express Business Blueprint is raising the bar in helping small businesses manage their cash flow from one place, said Grealish.

Gina Taylor, executive vice president and general manager of American Express Business Blueprint & Banking, said the company is the undisputed leader in small business cards with a customer base bigger than the next five card issuers combined in small business spend.

‚ÄúWe use our risk management to enable small businesses to spend more on the card and they have a lot of the benefits of earning rewards and value back,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a one-stop shop to view all of your cash flows and be able to manage them,‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúIt comes with insights, the ability to view all of your America Express card relationships in one place and add other relationships whether a card or checking account. In one place you will be able to view all of your money in and money out and money at risk.‚Äù

Over time Amex will add more analytics as well as AI to make better recommendations, she said.

‚ÄúCash flow analysis has usually been reserved for large business,‚Äù said an Amex spokesperson. ‚ÄúNow they [small businesses] can run their business with American Express.‚Äù

How this differs from what Square, now Block, offers, isn‚Äôt clear.

John Maggitti, co-founder of Novel Bay Booksellers in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., was underwhelmed.

‚ÄúThere's nothing exciting here. Excel is free. Square does this by default,‚Äù he said. The very successful five-year old book business largely runs on Square, which offers a variety of tools to help small businesses.

As Square says on its site: ‚ÄúIf you are a Square seller, you can also pull reports from your Square Dashboard that give you insights into sales trends and more,‚Äù it says. (For a description of the ways Square met the needs of small businesses see my article on founder Jim McElvey‚Äôs book, The Innovation Stack.)

‚ÄúAny U.S. small business may access, for free, personalized cash flow insights to help them make financial decisions more confidently,‚Äù the company said in its announcement. ‚ÄúSmall businesses may also access applications for select financial products, like a business line of credit,‚Äù the announcement said.

‚ÄúBusiness Blueprint marks a critical next step in American Express‚Äôs vision of becoming a digital one-stop shop for small businesses‚Äô financial needs, whether to manage their cash flow, make payments, get paid, or access working capital,‚Äù said Anna Marrs, group president of global commercial services and credit fraud risk at American Express.

While it may be a big step for Amex, its impact on small businesses remains to be seen.

Gealish wrote in ‚ÄúReinventing Small Business Banking Part 2‚Äù that ‚ÄúSmall business banking is ripe for disruption as evidenced by the onslaught of fintech and big tech players vying to capture traditional as well as new revenue streams. The winners over the next decade will not look like today‚Äôs banks.‚Äù

Aperture, a fintech research and marketing firm based in Geneva, looks for firms using the latest technology.

For instance, Assure Hedge works with partner firms to provide foreign exchange (FX) hedging for small businesses. Barry McCarthy, founder and CEO of Assure Hedge, says he started it to address the problem small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have in hedging their FX risk.

Banks don‚Äôt want to offer a price for anything less than one million, he said, and the process would be too complicated for most SMEs to bother with. Assure Hedge has removed the complexity for users.

‚ÄúThe products have been digitized and they're presented to the customer when they need them, in a form of the job they need done. I think that's the bit that people sometimes miss with banking products ‚Äî changing forms from being like off-the-shelf banking products to being much closer to a customer‚Äôs job to be done.‚Äù

The White House has sought to highlight the resilience of the U.S. economy in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates and mounting layoffs across the technology, real estate and media sectors in making arguments for Biden‚Äôs economic stewardship.

Inflation had been expected to be a serious headwind for Democrats in last November‚Äôs midterms, but instead the party exceeded expectations by gaining a Senate seat while keeping its House losses to a minimum.

New threats are now on the horizon even as the White House hopes for a soft economic landing from Federal Reserve efforts to lower inflation and prevent a recession.

Here are some of the economic challenges confronting Biden.

Mounting layoffs at big technology companies ‚Äî many of which drastically expanded operations throughout the pandemic ‚Äî have prompted a parade of worrying headlines and concerns among some investors.

Major tech companies have laid off more than 200,000 workers over the past four months, the majority of which are for high-paying, white-collar jobs. Amazon, Microsoft and Google in particular announced tens of thousands of layoffs this week.

The White House said this week that Biden is monitoring the layoffs and is aware of the impact it has on workers and their families.

They also argued that the layoffs overall are at a low level, pushing back on the idea that the decisions by Microsoft and Google represent a major concern for the economy or workers in other industries.

‚ÄúThe U.S. economy continues to grow ‚Ä¶ and the unemployment is a 50-year low. So leading analysts have publicly stated that they do not believe the recent layoffs in the tech industry are indicative of trends in the broader economy,‚Äù press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday.

Only about 190,000 Americans filed new first-time claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending Jan. 14, according to Labor Department data. Layoffs on the whole remain well below average levels from 2019, when new weekly jobless claims regularly topped 200,000 or more.

Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said the high demand for workers in other sectors has helped those laid off from big tech firms and other hard-hit sectors find work quickly.

‚ÄúThe labor market is still so tight that many tech workers, and workers with other skills, are snapped up well before they need to collect an unemployment check,‚Äù Frick explained in a Thursday analysis.

The White House is standing firm that it will not negotiate with Republicans in Congress who are demanding spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation‚Äôs debt ceiling.

The White House has pointed to numerous clean debt ceiling hikes in recent years, including when Donald Trump was president and Republicans controlled Congress, as precedent for why House Republicans shouldn‚Äôt demand conditions.

Negotiations may be inevitable given the GOP‚Äôs control of the House and the fact that Democrats need Republican votes in the Senate to get past procedural obstacles.

The stakes are high, with experts warning that a default would cause deep pain to the economy.

The Treasury Department has already enacted ‚Äúextraordinary measures‚Äù that will allow the U.S. to avoid a default over the next few months, but some kind of deal is likely to be needed in June.

The Fed‚Äôs rapid interest rate hikes have helped bring inflation down from a 9.1 percent annual rate in June to 6.5 percent in December, according to Labor Department data released last week.

The steady decline of inflation and the slowing of the U.S. economy have pushed the Fed to slow down its interest rate hikes. The Fed is expected to hike its baseline interest rate range by 0.25 percentage points on Feb 1., which would be its smallest rate hike since March 2022.

Some experts and investors think the Fed has already done enough to keep annual inflation moving down to its target of 2 percent and should be careful about weighing down the economy with even higher rates.

‚ÄúI think there is all the room in the world for the Fed to really reduce its pace of interest rate increases. Honestly, I‚Äôd go to zero,‚Äù said Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.

But Fed leaders have made clear that they are not yet done hiking rates and would rather risk driving the economy into a recession than losing control of inflation.

‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt declare victory too soon, right? If you back off ‚Ä¶ while inflation is still elevated, it‚Äôll come back ever higher the next time, meaning you have got to do even more damage to take control of it,‚Äù said Tom Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in a Tuesday interview on Fox Business Network.

Many Americans are finally reaching their breaking points after two years of high inflation.

Retail sales fell in both November and December, according to data released Wednesday by the Census Bureau, even amid the traditionally busy holiday shopping season. Factory output has fallen as stores struggle to clear out growing inventories, and the nearly yearlong slump in home sales is also sapping momentum from the economy.

While lower consumer demand is essential to bringing inflation down, a steady decline in spending could keep slowing the economy toward a recession. Roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity is driven by consumer spending, but many American households have now burnt through pandemic savings and are leaning on credit cards to keep pace.

‚ÄúWe are seeing some of the imbalances in supply and demand of the past two years that led to high inflation start to unwind. Declines in retail sales, after years of outsized gains in both prices and goods, are a good sign for getting back to normal,‚Äù wrote Claudia Sahm, a former Fed research director, in a Friday analysis.

Argentina exchanged around 64% of its debt maturing through June for new notes due in 2024 and 2025, according to an Economy Ministry statement. Argentina had said on Monday it expected to swap between 55% and 70% of its approximately $37 billion in local obligations coming due in the second quarter.

‚ÄúFigures are weaker than what we expected,‚Äù said Juan Manuel Pazos, chief economist at TPCG Valores in Buenos Aires. ‚ÄúNon-regulated players basically held out. The government still has a lot of work to do to clear its second-quarter maturities.‚Äù

It‚Äôs also not clear how voluntary this swap was for many parties. The public sector, including public banks and the state-run pension fund Anses, hold about half the nation‚Äôs local bonds due this quarter and were forced to swap. And private sector banks, which are regulated under state law, must enter a portion of their holdings in the swap.

S&P Global Ratings slashed Argentina‚Äôs local currency debt rating to selective default because it considers its peso-debt exchange ‚Äúdistressed based on the likelihood of conventional default,‚Äù absent the participation of creditors, S&P analysts led by Lisa Schineller wrote in a statement.

It‚Äôs the second time the credit assessor has cut Argentina‚Äôs local currency rating this year. A similar swap in January, when the nation extended maturities on 2.89 trillion pesos of notes, was also deemed a ‚Äúselective default‚Äù by S&P. Soon after that, S&P raised the local currency debt rating to CCC-.

Fitch Ratings Inc. declined to comment on Wednesday. A representative for Moody‚Äôs Investors Service didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

Even after the exchange, Argentina has a $174 billion mountain of local debt to manage. That pile is growing almost exponentially because so many of its obligations are linked to inflation, which is running at around 100%. Economists from Argentina‚Äôs main opposition coalition have complained that the government‚Äôs debt exchange plan only delays the pain that‚Äôs coming for whoever is president after the next election.

Securities that aren‚Äôt exchanged will have to be refinanced when the country auctions new bonds, which could be expensive and difficult soon before a presidential election in October whose outcome is uncertain.

Failure to roll over its obligations risks a mass exodus from Argentina‚Äôs local debt in coming months, forcing the government to print money to cover its obligations and pushing inflation even higher. But President Alberto Fernandez‚Äôs administration says a successful exchange will show that Argentina can keep its debt obligations under control.

‚ÄúWe want to leave behind the idea that Argentina is always weeks away from a default,‚Äù Economy Minister Sergio Massa said on Monday. ‚ÄúThis will allow us to clear up any uncertainty for 2023.‚Äù

Argentina has a long history of restructuring debt, and reneging on promises to bondholders. It has defaulted on foreign bonds three times since the turn of the century, most recently in a 2020 restructuring deal that gave investors about 55 cents on the dollar. It isn‚Äôt selling foreign debt now, but the international securities it has sold previously now trade for around 30 cents on the dollar.

‚ÄúWith expected participation around 65% to 70%, it should be good enough for a swap, but not enough to eliminate risks,‚Äù said Alejo Costa, chief Argentina strategist at BTG Pactual in Buenos Aires. ‚ÄúAs for a potential restructuring in the future, anyone would try to avoid it at first, but you never know.‚Äù

Some local investors like Adcap Asset Management‚Äôs Paula Gandara are skeptical the exchange will fully assuage the market‚Äôs concerns.

‚ÄúBut anything that aims to improve sentiment and the smooth functioning of the market is welcome,‚Äù Gandara said.

On an internal email thread among more than two dozen former Amazon employees who have since left to work at Google, titled ‚Äúworked_at_amazon,‚Äù one posted screenshots obtained by Insider that described an incident in which two Amazon employees were told to split a bagel at a staff meeting. The workers were purportedly told managers didn‚Äôt have the budget to order enough bagels for everyone.

Bagels weren‚Äôt the only breakfast item in short supply at Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos is currently the world‚Äôs fourth-richest person, with a net worth of $146 billion, according to Forbes. Two other workers grumbled in the thread that boxes of cereal were removed from Amazon‚Äôs office kitchens because they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt represent a frugal mindset,‚Äù according to Insider‚Äôs report.

‚ÄúEventually, we got told, ‚ÄòSpending a couple hundred bucks on cereal isn‚Äôt frugal. You are free to solicit donations to try and keep it running,'‚Äù one ex-Amazon staffer wrote in the thread, according to Insider.

The complaints about office snacks were reportedly part of a broader discussion about ‚Äúfrupidity‚Äù at Amazon ‚Äì a combination of ‚Äúfrugality‚Äù and ‚Äústupidity.‚Äù The workers allege that Amazon‚Äôs emphasis on frugality in day-to-day operations is overdone.

Ex-Amazon staffers also described difficulty obtaining tech gear and office supplies ‚Äì with one worker complaining that product managers would have to push back in order to receive an Apple MacBook instead of the Windows laptops provided by default.

‚ÄúI found it ridiculous because there‚Äôs no joy in Windows laptops and when there‚Äôs no joy, no creativity happens and when there‚Äôs no creativity, what‚Äôs a PM‚Äôs worth?‚Äù the staffer wrote.

Default risks are off the table for the next two can-kicking years.

On paper, the resolution should bring some calm to debt markets and ratchet down the commentary coming from C-suite leaders at various investment bank conferences this week and in June.

By no means is the deal perfect.

One has to wonder how consumer spending will be impacted as the freeze on student loans gets lifted in early September as part of the agreement. And two, the government spending caps could take a bite out of the economy.

But at least for today, a teensy bit of calm to a market that had grown jittery the past two weeks (see small-cap and defense stocks lagging, for instance).

Don't get too comfortable, however.

The market will now shift its gaze the Federal Reserve and whether it will lift interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Pros say it's a true toss up which direction the Fed will go, suggesting any debt ceiling market calm may prove short-lived.

""In our view, the decision on whether to raise rates is so finely balanced that it could still go either way depending on how events unfold between now and the meeting,"" points out UBS senior economist Brian Rose. ""At one point, markets had almost completely priced out another hike, but currently the market sees around a 50% chance of one more hike, either at the June meeting or at the following meeting on 25‚Äì26 July.""

There are strong cases for both.

Inflation is still far above the Fed's 2% target and the unemployment rate is at a historically low 3.4%. The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report showed long-run inflation expectations near 20 year highs.

If this Friday's May employment report hits above the consensus of around 200,000, it would be yet another data point to push the Fed into one more rate increase.

Markets wouldn't like that, and could trade off into the June Fed meeting.

On the other hand, the Fed has lifted rates 500 basis points from the lows. That's a lot of tightening, and it's beginning to show up in the economy.

Consumers are cutting back on discretionary purchases, as we learned from earnings out of Target, Best Buy, Walmart, RH and Urban Outfitters last week. You will likely sense a similar vibe in earnings out this week from Dollar General and Macy's.

Auto delinquencies are on the rise, as closely followed Apollo Group economist Torsten Slok noted in a piece of weekend research that crossed my inbox.

""The economy is balanced on a knife's edge,"" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told me last week on Yahoo Finance Live. ""When the Silicon Valley banking scare started, we saw a 15% overnight drop in business bookings, and that tells you the economy is very fragile.""

These economic clues suggest that the Fed needs to chill out with rate hikes before it induces a recession, or worse.

All in all, a tough call by the Fed soon.

And that means it remains a tough call among bulls and bears...despite the debt ceiling debacle hibernating for two years.

Authors from Goldman Sachs Economic Research wrote in a new note Tuesday that ‚Äúweak tax collections so far in April suggest an increased probability that the debt limit deadline will be reached in the first half of June.‚Äù Their conclusion is based on weaker receipts through April 14 with full data expected in the coming weeks.

Similarly, analysts at Wrightson ICAP who track the issue closely are not ruling out the possibility of a June default. They note in an update this week that if tax data remains soft, ‚Äúa June X-date might start to look like a significant risk without becoming our base case.‚Äù

Debt ceiling observers have been closely monitoring tax season for clues about how the ongoing debt ceiling crisis could play out in the coming weeks and months. Without a deal in Congress, the government is set to be unable to pay its bills in the coming months, which could have cascading effects that would almost surely rattle markets and, many fear, tip the economy into a recession.

At issue is if the IRS ends up collecting more than projected, it would marginally improve the U.S. government's books and delay the so-called X-date ‚Äî when the government is unable to pay its bills and is forced to default ‚Äî by a few weeks or months.

Experts are expecting much more clarity by early May, and the Goldman authors noted that there remains a strong chance that the government stays afloat until later in the summer. Still, either way, uncertainty is increasing and they say the the odds are increasing that Congress will need to reach a deal within weeks

Tuesday‚Äôs note from Goldman is a significant update from its estimate in February that targeted early to mid-August as the most likely deadline.

The Wrightson ICAP said it currently forecasts ‚Äúthe Treasury‚Äôs remaining fiscal resources...would run below $100 billion from June 6 to June 13.‚Äù

The sense is that, if the Treasury Department can stay afloat through June, additional tax receipts that are due in mid-June would give the government a bit more breathing room and delay a default until later in the summer ‚Äî unless the tax revenue comes in weaker than expected in the coming days.

What observers are watching is the remainder of the April tax receipts ‚Äî especially in capital gains. Goldman projects that a decline of 35% to 40% ""would be consistent with an early June deadline"" and added that their data so far shows receipts down 39% from last year.

Other analysts at other places that track the issue like the Congressional Budget Office and the Bipartisan Policy Center likely will release their own estimates in the coming weeks as the full picture from tax season becomes clearer.

Experts have long been focused on June as the first significant debt ceiling deadline. Earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen projected that ""it is unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June."" She has not updated her projections in the months since.

The U.S. formally hit the debt limit on Jan. 19 with Yellen and her aides beginning a process known as ""extraordinary measures"" in response. Those accounting maneuvers essentially allow the government to move money around in the vast U.S. Treasury to stave off an actual default, but for only a limited time.

Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., talks stalled. On Monday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) traveled to the New York Stock Exchange Monday to warn Wall Street of the growing chance lawmakers ‚Äúwill bumble into the first default in our nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù

Republicans are blaming the White House for the stalemate, while Biden officials have shot back that Congress needs to pass a simple increase in the debt ceiling and McCarthy is making demands that even Republicans can't agree on.

It‚Äôs so good, I‚Äôm convinced that just about every other smartphone and camera manufacturer should just blatantly rip it off for our collective betterment.

The Pixel camera app automatically calls up some nifty virtual horizon lines by default when you hold the phone steady to line up a shot. You guide the two tilting white lines toward a static yellow one, and when your picture is perfectly level from side to side (roll) and front to back (pitch), they all align and turn yellow. You even get a nice haptic buzz once your horizon reaches an even zero degrees. The UI for this assistive tool changes when you point the phone downward or upward, replacing the lines with two crosshairs. Line up the moving white crosshair with the yellow static one, and bada bing bada boom, you‚Äôve got a perfectly level zoom.

I can‚Äôt stress enough how handy this is when shooting flat lay images, like an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of items on a table or a lovely meal you just got served at a fancy restaurant ‚Äî you know, the stuff that‚Äôs perfect for the ‚Äògram. Those shots look awkward as hell when they‚Äôre crooked because it easily throws off the proportions.

Google isn‚Äôt the originator of all this leveling business with the Pixel. Apple started doing the double-crosshair thing in 2017 with iOS 11 on the iPhone X, and I know Samsung has had it from at least the Galaxy Note 10 generation in 2019. But Apple and Samsung only enable the crosshair leveler when you turn on their cameras‚Äô grid overlays, and they lack level lines for standard photos. So Google imitated but also innovated a bit, making a better experience overall.

As for full-size cameras, they‚Äôve had virtual horizons for many years, but their implementations have been outclassed by smartphones. I recall my first camera with it was the Nikon D700 in 2009, though it was fairly basic. The sad part is that larger cameras haven‚Äôt improved much on them since then. The virtual horizons of expensive flagships like a Sony A1, Nikon Z9, Canon R3, or Leica SL2 work great for standard shots but get lost as soon as you point them downward for a simple flat lay. As someone who frequently uses Sony A9 II and A7 IV cameras for weddings, it drives me mad knowing that the phone in my back pocket would potentially help me take this shot faster than these state-of-the-art mirrorless cams.

Why am I so obsessed with this? Maybe I secretly want to achieve true level, or maybe I have a bad habit of taking ever so slightly crooked shots when I‚Äôm working quickly and I‚Äôm a bit of a perfectionist. Regardless, I‚Äôm confident that it‚Äôs not just nit-picky part-time wedding photographers like me that would benefit from this feature. Product and food photography are whole categories that often require straight-down flat lay imagery, and trust me when I say it‚Äôs no fun having to bust out a physical bubble level to ensure you get it right in-camera.

Yes, you can take a bunch of shots to ensure you get it right, use software to correct crooked and off-axis proportions later, buy one of these silly things that takes up your hot shoe, or ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù and somehow nail a perfect handheld shot every time, but the technology exists to help anyone get this right consistently on the first try. It should be implemented in all cameras, smartphones, and pro cams alike.

I‚Äôm Bloomberg‚Äôs chief rates correspondent, Garfield Reynolds.

It really was deja vu all over again. The global bond rout accelerated into the end of the week as investors once more bailed on bets that an imminent recession would force central banks to halt interest-rate hikes and pivot toward cuts. Similar dynamics have played out at least three times during the last 18 months or so.

The yield on Bloomberg‚Äôs global gauge of government bonds soared to the highest since September 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis. UK traders bet on the highest cash rate in 25 years and a slew of robust US data spurred a sell-off in Treasuries. The US moves in particular look to have been turbocharged by stop-loss action as the overwhelming consensus that yields had peaked was shattered. JPMorgan Chase & Co.‚Äôs client survey in late June had shown investors were the most bullish since 2010.

Australia‚Äôs central bank may have added to investor complacency when it tried to carry out a ‚Äòhawkish hold‚Äô on Tuesday, a move initially seen as dovish, with yields and the Australian dollar slumping. But the Federal Reserve offered a rapid antidote to any thoughts that pausing means stopping. Minutes from the June meeting revealed there was a strong constituency for a hike that month ‚Äî and that tightening in July is probably the base case.

Fed Dallas President Lorie Logan said more rate increases will likely be needed. European officials are also biased toward higher rates and are emphasizing the need to keep policy restrictive for longer. Even Singapore‚Äôs central bank chief added his voice to the chorus of inflation concerns.

Right now, former Fed official Bill Dudley‚Äôs forecast for a 4.5% 10-year US yield is looking more likely than Morgan Stanley‚Äôs bullish call for a drop to 3% or less.

While the renewed wave of hawkishness from central banks is being driven by signs of economic resilience, many still expect the ultimate result will be a harder landing. Allianz‚Äôs chief economist Ludovic Subran sees the potential that US or eurozone policymakers overdo tightening as one of the most prominent threats to the global economy. And even amidst the turmoil this week the classic Treasuries curve inverted past a percentage point to test the lows touched in March before the banking crisis hit.

King Street Capital Management, a $23 billion hedge fund with a record of pouncing on high-profile distressed debt events, sees a slow-motion car crash in credit as rising rates and a weakening economy pinch companies laden with debt taken on when borrowing costs were much lower.

Citigroup Inc. analysts meantime warned that measures of corporate leverage are ticking up once again. Credit investors were already starting to turn bearish after corporate notes failed to live up to lofty expectations of double-digit returns so far this year.

While bond investors in developed markets fret that rate hikes will spur recessions, China‚Äôs markets are worry that with the recovery losing steam, authorities haven‚Äôt yet announced the sort of stimulus required to turn things around.

The property debt crisis rolled on, as defaulted developer Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. failed to find a buyer for a $1.8 billion project at a forced auction, even at a heavy discount. Sino-Ocean Group Holding Ltd. saw its bonds tumble as the state-backed builder told some creditors it‚Äôs working with two major shareholders on its debt.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Chinese banks have stopped buying bonds issued in the Shanghai free trade zone after regulators increased scrutiny of the $18 billion market mostly used by the nation‚Äôs local government financing vehicles. Banks did move to cut rates for the nation‚Äôs $453 billion corporate US dollar deposits though, as authorities intensify measures to shore up the struggling yuan.

Every time Jerome Powell has something to say, markets hang on his every word (maybe one day people will say the same is true of this newsletter). But in between major policy meetings, markets are almost as equally attuned to the words of other Fed officials.

And two of them just shared conflicting messages.

Quick note: Insider just put together a list of Wall Street's rising stars of equity research. See who made the cut.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here.

1. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that the central bank will need to raise interest rates two more times this year to stamp out inflation.

Bullard, who's always leaned more hawkish on policy, has been a proponent for aggressive rate hikes since last year.

""I think we're going to have to grind higher with the policy rate in order to put enough downward pressure on inflation and to return inflation to target in a timely manner,"" Bullard said at an event in Florida on Monday.

""I'm thinking two more moves this year ‚Äî exactly where those would be this year I don't know ‚Äî but I've often advocated sooner rather than later.""

In 10 consecutive rate hikes, policymakers have raised the benchmark rate from near zero to the 5%-5.25% range.

The last three moves have been quarter-point hikes, and the banking turmoil that started in March has led Powell to claim that tighter lending conditions could do some of the Fed's job for it.

But Bullard still wants to keep a foot on the gas.

""As long as the labor market is so good it's a great time to fight inflation,"" he said. ""Get it back to target. Get this problem behind us and not replay the 1970s.""

His stance isn't exactly consensus. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Monday that it's tough to know whether to pause rate hikes or keep going in June.

""I think right now it's a close call, either way, versus raising another time in June or skipping,"" Kashkari said in a CNBC interview. ""What's important to me is not signaling that we're done.""

Waiting for more information on prices and payrolls could be key, and Powell said last week that they could ""afford"" to take time to assess the impact of rate hikes.

As of now, fed fund futures are implying about a 74% chance of a pause at the next meeting.

To economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, any additional hikes bode poorly for the economy. They think it's time for central bankers to recognize that they've already done enough.

""Raising rates further ‚Äî actually, not cutting rates very soon ‚Äî will amount to overkill,"" the experts said Monday.

Given that they've just embarked on the steepest hiking cycle in four decades, the group expects inflation to keep falling whether the Fed hikes or not.

As far as recession risks go, Pantheon maintained that policymakers pushing for a June rate hike are ""playing with fire.""

5. Just five stocks are worth almost a quarter of the entire S&P 500. Those include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. Together they're worth nearly $9 trillion.

6. JPMorgan expects to earn $3 billion more this year after its takeover of First Republic. The deal for the failed bank could boost the firm's net interest income from $81 billion to $84 billion, JPMorgan said Monday. But that outlook's based on several key assumptions.

7. Bank of America just raised its S&P 500 price target from 4,000 to 4,300. That's about 3% upside from current levels, and would imply full-year gains of about 12%. Still, it's possible, according to the firm, that the index could soar as high as 4,600 given that much of the bad economic news is already priced in.

8. A fund manager for institutional clients shared offensive and defensive strategies for building portfolios to last generations. She's expecting a mild recession this year, and said valuations are high currently and don't reflect appropriate risks. Here's what every investor can learn from her approach.

9. Bank of America named 20 stocks set to outperform once the Fed halts rate hikes. All the companies in this batch share three key characteristics that make them attractive bets because of their quality, value, and technical strength. More details here.

10. White House economists warned this month that the S&P 500 could crash 45% if the US defaults on its debt. The debt ceiling talks continue to stagnate, and the so-called X-date is inching closer by the day. The projection also includes estimates for weakening retirement accounts and pullbacks in consumption and investment.

Andrea Vazzana, a child psychologist who specializes in the treatment of eating disorders in children, adolescents and adults at NYU Langone, said the negative influence of social media is largely owed to the amount of social comparisons that are part of engaging in these social media platforms.

Increased use of social media has also contributed, in part, to the shifting demographics of those affected by eating disorders, according to Vazzana. She said there has been an increase in younger individuals, including tweens as young as 9 and 10 years old, suffering from eating disorders.

‚ÄúThis may be correlational data, but we‚Äôre seeing people joining social media platforms at an earlier age as well,"" she told ABC News.

Vazzana noted that in addition to showing overedited, filtered photos, social media sites also offer users ways to find content like weight loss challenges, videos of purging techniques and unhealthy diets.

A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit organization, found that within 30 minutes of a 13-year-old joining TikTok, the teen was being recommended content tied to eating disorders.

Nearly 10% of the world‚Äôs population and an estimated 30 million people in the United States are affected by an eating disorder, according to a report from the Academy for Eating Disorders and Deloitte Access Economics.

The National Institute of Mental Health defines eating disorders as serious illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person‚Äôs eating behaviors.

During National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, now through March 5, health professionals and recovery advocates are raising awareness about the importance of social media literacy to combat eating disorders.

Vazzana suggests parents and teens have conversations about social media literacy: comparisons, the use of filters and Photoshop and the concept of a highlight reel.

She believes ‚Äúfriending‚Äù people on social media that you know in real life, instead of following influencers and strangers, may be a protective factor in combating poor self-esteem from comparison. Limiting time on social media, as multiple studies have highlighted, can also be beneficial for both mental health and weight esteem.

When it comes to allowing children on social media, Vazzana said age is an important factor for parents to consider as research demonstrates that girls who engage on social media earlier than their peers have a higher drive for thinness.

In January, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said he believes 13 is too young for children to be on social media platforms, despite some of the most popular platforms allowing users to be that age.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, requires users to be at least 13 years old to use its platforms, according to the company's website.

TikTok and Snapchat each also require users to be at least 13-years-old, according to their respective websites.

Google, the parent company of YouTube, does not allow kids under age 13 to create their own Google Account. YouTube allows parents to set up a ""supervised account"" for a child under age 13, for which they can control the content settings, according to its website.

In most cases, the social media sites require people to enter their birth dates in order to sign up as users.

Sam Dylan Finch, a recovery advocate, told ABC News that while social media can be a powerful tool in eating disorder recovery -- including his own -- it can also trap users in cycles of comparison and self-critique.

‚ÄúIt can be a vehicle for fad diets, health misinformation, harsh criticism, especially for those of us that don‚Äôt conform to society‚Äôs ideals of beauty and achievement,"" he said. ""And perpetuates standards of perfection that are impossible to achieve.""

Dylan Finch added that he believes how you curate your social media feed is important, in order to rule out false promises of esteem that the diet culture tries to sell, often through sponsored posts.

‚ÄúThis makes curating our feeds a powerful act of self-care that every one of us should take seriously,"" he said.

Some social media sites have started to provide in-app resources for eating disorders and raise awareness.

In 2020, TikTok partnered with the National Eating Disorder Association, telling ABC News at the time, ""At TikTok we work to foster an inclusive, body-positive environment where people can find support, affirmation and empathy within their community. Our goal is to create a space where our community feels comfortable and confident to be exactly who they are and express themselves freely.""

Instagram also has protections for kids, including support for people struggling with body image issues, age verification, parental controls, decreasing visibility of content that is potentially sensitive, time control settings, default settings to provide more privacy, as well as in-app resources offering mental health support, a spokesperson told ABC News last year.

When preoccupations with eating, exercise and photographs for social media start to distract a child from what is happening in real life, Vazzana suggests seeking professional help.

She said that pushing back against appearance ideals allows for more meaningful engagement in the real world, saying, ""It‚Äôs almost like a bit of obstinance that can be used in a healthy way.‚Äù

Yet 15 years later, the forced sale of 166-year-old Credit Suisse ‚Äî one of 30 banks around the world designated by regulators as ""globally significant,"" as well as the startling failure of regional lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) ‚Äî are rekindling concerns about the risk of financial institutions defined as too big to fail.

One thing that's changed in the intervening years since the housing bust: The nation's largest banks have only grown larger. JPMorgan Chase now has $2.6 billion in assets, a 16% increase from 2008, while Bank of America's assets have jumped 69% to $3.1 trillion. At the same time, lawmakers in 2018 weakened the post-crisis regulations enacted in what came to be known as Dodd-Frank, a sweeping law passed in 2010 aimed at ensuring the safety of the U.S. banking systems.

The ""too big to fail"" banks ""are still incredibly risky, and they are bigger and more concentrated than before,"" said Mike Konczal, the director of macroeconomic analysis at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank.

To be sure, the 2008 financial crisis involved issues including complex financial instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps and derivatives, along with lax lending standards. Such issues aren't playing a part in the recent banking turmoil.

Instead, Switzerland's Credit Suisse was hamstrung by a number of other problems, including a $5.5 billion loss on its dealings with private investment firm Archegos in 2021 and a spying scandal. When its biggest investor, Saudi National Bank, last week declined to put up more money, investors and depositors headed for the exits, paving the way for UBS' takeover over the bank on Sunday.

""Very boring banking"" but still risky

Investors cast a more skeptical look at Credit Suisse in the aftermath of SVB's March 10 collapse, when U.S. regulators took over the regional bank and declared it insolvent. Unlike the 2008 crisis, SVB's problems stemmed from what Konczal calls ""very boring banking, all things considered.""

SVB was hit by a double-whammy of higher interest rates, which lowered the value of its U.S. government and mortgage bond holdings, and a faster cash-burn rate by its tech-heavy customers due to the slowing economy. With depositors withdrawing money at a faster clip, SVB had to sell its bonds to shore up its capital, but took a $1.8 billion loss on the sale because of the decline in the value of those investments.

SVB also had a significantly higher share of uninsured depositors than other banks, which meant that much of their assets wouldn't be protected by the FDIC's $250,000 insurance if the bank failed. As a result, spooked depositors rushed to withdraw their funds, creating a classic ""run on the bank.""

Experts say Congress opened the door to such problems five years ago when it loosened parts of Dodd-Frank, which among other changes forced the nation's biggest banks to adopt safer lending and investing practices. Under that law, banks with more than $50 billion in assets became subject to stringent requirements including a stress test, which examines whether a bank has enough capital to survive when financial conditions sour.

The 2018 law blunting Dodd-Frank lifted that threshold from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion. That meant SVB, with just over $200 billion in assets, didn't have to undergo a stress test.

""[T]here would have been increased scrutiny"" Konczal said, noting the move to weaken the banking laws.

""It certainly was the case that Congress and regulators really did believe that banks in this [midsize] range would have less of a problem and it would be mitigated,"" he said.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced a bill on March 14 that would roll back the 2018 law weakening Dodd-Frank. Other lawmakers are proposing an overhaul of FDIC insurance in order to protect a greater share of deposits.

Warren noted in a statement that she had warned that rolling back parts of Dodd-Frank would cause banks to ""load up on risk to boost their profits and collapse, threatening our entire economy ‚Äî and that is precisely what happened.""

Asked if one of the ""too big to fail"" banks could falter, Konczal noted the banking problems aren't as bad as in 2008, while adding, ""We just don't know.""

""Everyone thought it was fine with when the Fed bailed out Bear Stears, and five months later Lehman [Brothers] failed,"" he said.

Meanwhile, part of the issue impacting the banking industry boils down to something that's hard to address through regulation: ""contagion,"" or the potential for depositors' fears about bank safety to migrate to other institutions, causing more bank runs and additional failures.

""Bank runs are a crisis of confidence,"" said Gary Cohn, the former top economic adviser in the Trump White House who is now vice chairman of IBM, told ""Face the Nation.""

Officials at Threadneedle Street last week held talks with large and small banks, assessing their risk profiles and asking for a breakdown of their investments in bond markets as chaos engulfed Credit Suisse and a string of US lenders.

The talks also covered any direct UK exposure the banks had to the embattled Swiss lender, which is understood to be minimal.

It comes as regulators in the US and Europe attempt to stem a growing crisis in the banking industry.

In Switzerland, senior executives at Credit Suisse were holding crisis meetings over the weekend to plot a solution as it struggles to regain confidence from investors.

Despite Switzerland's central bank stepping in on Thursday to make $54bn (¬£44.5bn) available to Credit Suisse in a bid to stabilise the situation, its shares fell a further 8pc on Friday.

Shares in the bank sank by more than a quarter last week, with analysts now predicting that it could be taken over by rival UBS.

In the US, shares in the regional lender First Republic Bank tanked by a third on Friday despite a group of Wall Street giants propping up the crisis-hit Californian lender with a $30bn cash injection.

The trigger for the current crisis was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which went bust after its bets on government bonds turned sour following a rise in interest rates.

The bank revealed that it lost $1.8bn on the sale of a portion of its bond portfolio, forcing it to try and raise fresh capital, which spooked depositors who rushed to take out their cash out of the bank.

Regulators in the UK have been scrambling to determine whether British lenders could fall foul of similar bets, which led to Bank of England officials approaching UK banks last week.

It is understood that the intervention was a precautionary measure to check that lenders remain in robust health, and did not reveal any immediate threats to the UK financial system.

City sources said the system is far stronger than in 2008 and there is widespread confidence that lenders of all sizes can weather the present disruption comfortably.

However, the unusual intervention highlights the level of concern triggered by the failure of SVB and the issues at Credit Suisse.

City sources said the credit departments of large UK banks had been closely liaising with Threadneedle Street and the City watchdog.

They added that a smaller lender had received a number of information requests from the Bank‚Äôs Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), including a breakdown of their exposure to bond markets.

Around $466m has been pulled out of Credit Suisse's European and US managed funds in recent days, according to data from Morningstar.

A source at one rival bank in the City said clients were pulling money from Credit Suisse ‚Äúlike you wouldn't believe‚Äù.

The source added: ‚ÄúThe loan from the Swiss National Bank has helped calm the panic of default but clients there are still very scared.‚Äù

Ulrich K√∂rner, Credit Suisse‚Äôs chief executive, last week said: ‚ÄúThese measures we have taken demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation to deliver value to our clients and other stakeholders.

‚ÄúMy team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs.‚Äù

The tests, born out of the Great Recession, are undertaken in order to determine if the nation‚Äôs largest banks can withstand a severe economic downturn.

The results will be especially scrutinized this year, after the collapse of three US banks sent shockwaves through the global banking system. But it‚Äôs unlikely the stress tests will reveal bank vulnerabilities that could prevent a future bank failure, said Francisco Covas, head of research at the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group representing many of the country‚Äôs largest banks.

That‚Äôs because no stress test scenario could perfectly predict the conditions that would cause a bank to collapse. And besides, that‚Äôs not the purpose of stress tests, said Covas, a former Fed economist who developed some of the central bank‚Äôs early stress tests.

Under this year‚Äôs scenario, or hypothetical recession condition, the unemployment rate rises by 6.5 percentage points over the course of two years. In last year‚Äôs scenario, the unemployment rate rose by 5.8 percentage points.

This year‚Äôs scenario also features a more extreme and rapid decline in home prices of 38% versus last year‚Äôs 28.5% decline. But no changes were made with regard to commercial real estate, an increasingly troublesome area for banks, as many offices remain vacant. Like last year, the scenario assumes a 40% plunge in commercial real estate prices.

Additionally, banks with large trading operations will be tested against a global market shock component that stresses their trading, private equity, and certain other fair-valued positions,‚Äù according to the Fed‚Äôs February report detailing the 2023 stress test scenarios. Almost all of those banks will also be tested against ‚Äúthe default of their largest counterparty.‚Äù

And for the first time, US banks deemed systemically important globally ‚Äî aka ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù ‚Äî will face an additional ‚Äúexploratory market shock‚Äù that poses a different set of risks than the global market shock component.

The Fed‚Äôs report will include firm-specific results for the exploratory component, but they won‚Äôt be used to set banks‚Äô capital requirements.

The firm-specific results could ‚Äúgive us light into which banks could experience more stress [in a recession],‚Äù said Jo√£o Granja, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in banking regulation.

The test scenarios were designed before the banking crisis

Fed officials update the stress test scenarios each year to capture the latest vulnerabilities in the economy. This year‚Äôs scenarios were selected before the bank failures and have not been updated since.

But it would have been prudent for the Fed to update the scenarios, given what they‚Äôve learned about the nature of the recent bank failures, said Granja.

Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank failed in part because they weren‚Äôt prepared for an environment with rising interest rates coupled with a shrinking deposit base. Yet the scenarios for this year‚Äôs tests assume interest rates will fall, which is generally the case in a recession.

Still, the stress tests should produce meaningful results that the Fed will use to determine if banks are sufficiently capitalized to absorb losses during a severe recession, said Covas. That‚Äôs partly because this year‚Äôs ‚Äúseverely adverse‚Äù scenario is even more painful than last year‚Äôs, he said.

Will any banks fail the test?

Even though the scenarios are more severe, Covas thinks all 23 banks undergoing the Fed‚Äôs stress tests will pass because ‚Äúthey are so well capitalized.‚Äù

That said, this year‚Äôs adverse scenario is likely to result in much steeper loan losses for banks due to their commercial real estate exposure, he told CNN. That would probably lead the Fed to impose tougher capital requirements on some banks.

Tougher requirements, in turn, would cause banks to revisit how much money to allocate to their business versus to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, he said.

It‚Äôs a misconception that ‚Äúif no bank fails these stress tests are not useful,‚Äù or the tests were too easy, Covas said. Ultimately the tests are meant to determine if banks are well-capitalized relative to the risks they‚Äôre taking on.

Now, the pendulum has swung so far in the opposite direction that the private sector has all but ceased taking on mortgage risk any more.

Why it matters: Private-sector risk aversion has prevented millions of Americans from buying houses. It is also driving banks out of the mortgage game. That might be OK, if the nonbanks weren't disappearing too, and unlikely to return any time soon.

Flashback: Banks paid more than $100 billion in mortgage-related fines after the financial crisis ‚Äî a stark reminder that such activity can prove extraordinarily costly.
‚Ä¢ That, alongside more stringent government rules about how much capital banks need to allocate to such activity, has resulted in what one banker described to Axios as a ""derisking"" in mortgage lending ‚Äî a/k/a an ongoing exit.

How it works: Most mortgage lenders make money in two ways.
‚Ä¢ After they originate the loan, they hold it on their books for a relatively short amount of time before selling it to the government ‚Äî either directly (the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs both buy mortgages) or to agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
‚Ä¢ After selling the loan, the originator generally continues to service it ‚Äî to collect mortgage payments and send them on to the loan's new owner. Servicing fees are low, generally about a quarter of a percent, and servicers need to make the payments even if the homeowner is in arrears.

Bank capital and liquidity rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis make both activities unattractive to banks trying to maximize their return on capital ‚Äî especially once compliance costs are added in.
‚Ä¢ ""The Basel rules on capital are so punitive the banks really can‚Äôt afford to be in the servicing business,"" Urban Institute fellow Ted Tozer tells Axios.
‚Ä¢ Add in an unknown chance of fines and/or shaming from regulators and politicians, and banks have broadly concluded this isn't a business they want to be in.

Where it stands: Nonbanks now originate 71% of agency-backed loans and 86% of government-backed loans, per Inside Mortgage Finance.
‚Ä¢ While those figures are the result of a long-term trend going back more than a decade, they're probably growing faster than ever at the moment. ""Over the last month, I think it‚Äôs begun to accelerate,"" BTIG analyst Eric Hagen tells Axios, as deposits have fled banks.
‚Ä¢ Banks still eclipse nonbanks in the relatively small market for jumbo loans that aren't backed by the government, since such products help to build relationships with high-value customers, and can be held as long-term assets on the bank's balance sheet.

The big picture: The mortgage market is now dominated by nonbanks that operate with relatively thin cushions of capital and need substantial economies of scale.
‚Ä¢ Between March 2021 and January 2023, total mortgage originations fell by 83%, per Black Knight. Refinancings ‚Äî which were more than 70% of the total at the beginning of the period ‚Äî dropped by a stunning 95%, as spiking interest rates killed demand.
‚Ä¢ Refinancings are the relatively cheap and easy way for nonbanks to make money in the mortgage business. Without them, more of those lenders are likely to close.
‚Ä¢ Given that most outstanding mortgages are at 3% or lower, refinancings aren't going to pick up any time soon. The result is that few if any new nonbank lenders are likely to enter the market, even as the number of existing lenders continues to dwindle.

Why it's so hard to qualify for a mortgage

Because loan servicers have to make mortgage payments even when homeowners don't, they have a strong incentive to avoid that situation.
‚Ä¢ The result is that while government agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are willing to buy riskier mortgages, lenders aren't willing to originate them, and would-be homebuyers with less-than-stellar credit find it extremely difficult to buy a house.

""It is becoming increasingly difficult for banks to stay in the mortgage business, which ultimately hurts everyday Americans,"" wrote JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in this year's shareholder letter.
‚Ä¢ The Urban Institute estimates that if mortgage credit reverted to normal levels ‚Äî below the excesses of the mid-2000s but much looser than today ‚Äî an extra 1 million loans could be written per year.

The problem is not so much that lenders aren't willing to take on credit risk. As the higher default rates on government-backed loans demonstrate, lenders will do that ‚Äî if they're paid more for servicing such loans. (FHA and VA loans typically pay about 0.45% to servicers, compared with the 0.25% paid by Fannie and Freddie.)

The real issue isn't credit ‚Äî it's liquidity. Lenders need to be liquid enough to front a large number of mortgage payments pending some kind of resolution like a foreclosure or a workout.
‚Ä¢ Many servicers, for instance, would have run out of cash very quickly during the early weeks of the pandemic were it not for official government mortgage forbearance programs.

The bottom line: So long as the government continues to backstop mortgages, they won't go away.

But it appears that most banks didn‚Äôt make these mistakes and most depositors didn‚Äôt feel the need to move their deposits.

Credit conditions have been quite favorable for small firms since the Fed instituted Zero Interest-Rate Policy (ZIRP), a policy not good for savers but a real boon to borrowers. From 2009 to 2015, borrower satisfaction improved, with the percent reporting credit needs not satisfied falling from highs of 11% in 2010 to 2% this year (March) (Chart 1). Owners are asked to compare the difficulty encountered getting their current loan to that experienced with their last loan. Complaints peaked at 16% in May 2009, falling rapidly to 1% in August 2019, stabilizing in a range between 1% and 4% until July 2022, when it began to rise, reaching 9% in March 2023, reflecting the Fed‚Äôs push to raise interest rates and tighten credit standards.

Overall, it appears that rising interest rates have not discouraged credit-worthy small business owners. Yes, rates are higher and more small business owners report loans harder to get than the last time they borrowed, but the percent reporting that their credit needs were not met has stayed close to 0%. The average interest rate on loans reported by owners has risen from a low of 4.1% in July 2020 to 7.9% in February of this year.

What they're saying: ""The Bank‚Äôs growth outpaced the development of its risk control framework,"" the state report says.
‚Ä¢ When it seized Signature, NYDFS was in the middle of writing up its latest review of the bank's inadequate liquidity controls, a complaint it had about the bank going back years.
‚Ä¢ Signature overwhelmingly served commercial clients, meaning it had very large liabilities that weren't subject to FDIC insurance. It had $98 billion in uninsured deposits, representing the value of 82% of its total assets.

The intrigue: Rumors have swirled that Signature, which facilitated real-time dollar transfers between crypto exchanges, was punished for serving the blockchain industry.
‚Ä¢ For her part, NYDFS chief Adrienne Harris has already said that's inaccurate.

‚Ä¢ ""The bigger issue for Signature was that the Bank had a high concentration of uninsured deposits and was perceived as a crypto bank. In that sense, it was closely associated with Silvergate and SVB,"" the report says.

How it worked: NYDFS argues that because Signature was seen as having a similar profile to banks that had already collapsed, its customers were rushing to pull deposits.
‚Ä¢ The bank, it noted, had failed to make arrangements with lenders of last resort, such as the New York Fed, to post assets that would enable it quickly cover liquidity demands.

            Following the collapse of First Republic last week, the meltdown of three other banks, and the Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase, making the tenth straight hike in an aggressive campaign to tame elevated inflation, a professor of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business presented a grim warning that the regional banking dominos are falling. 

In a New York Times opinion piece titled ""Yes, You Should Be Worried About a Potential Bank Crisis. Here's Why,"" Professor Amit Seru wrote, ""the fragility and collapse of several high-profile banks are most likely not an isolated phenomenon."" He said, ""A damaging combination of fast-rising interest rates, major changes in work patterns, and the potential of a recession could prompt a credit crunch not seen since the 2008 financial crisis."" 


Just in the past few months, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank have failed. Their combined assets surpassed those held by the 25 banks (when adjusted for inflation) that collapsed at the height of the financial crisis. While some experts and policymakers believe that the resolution of First Republic Bank on Monday indicates the turbulence in the industry is coming to an end, I believe this may be premature. On Thursday, shares of PacWest and Western Alliance are falling as investors' fears spread. Adverse conditions have significantly weakened the ability of many banks to withstand another credit shock ‚Äî and it's clear that a big one may already be on its way.

Rapidly rising interest rates create perilous conditions for banks because of a basic principle: The longer the duration of an investment, the more sensitive it is to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the assets that banks hold to generate a return on their investment fall in value. And because the banks' liabilities ‚Äî like its deposits, which customers can withdraw at any time ‚Äî usually are shorter in duration, they fall by less. Thus, increases in interest rates can deplete a bank's equity and risk leaving it with more liabilities than assets. So it's no surprise that the US banking system's market value of assets is around $2 trillion lower than suggested by their book value. When the entire set of approximately 4,800 banks in the United States is examined, the decline in the value of equity is most prominent for midsize and smaller banks, reflecting their heavier bets on long-term assets.


In an interview with The Guardian, Seru was more precise about just how many banks were burning through their capital buffers and were underwater. The estimate is shocking: Almost half of America's 4,800 banks.


""It's spooky. Thousands of banks are underwater.

""Let's not pretend that this is just about Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. A lot of the US banking system is potentially insolvent.""


Since monetary tightening works in long lags (9-12 months), many of the rate hikes over the last year have yet to filter through the real economy. In the coming quarters, the US banking system will face its toughest challenge yet, as tightening lending standards might spark more breaking. 

In Seru's NYTimes op-ed piece, he noted, ""There's another looming area of concern that could spark such panic: The commercial real estate sector."" 


Commercial real estate loans, worth $2.7 trillion in the United States, make up around a quarter of an average bank's assets. Many of these loans are coming due in the next few years, and refinancing them at higher rates naturally increases the risk of default. Rising interest rates also depress the value of commercial properties, especially those with long-term leases and limited rent escalation clauses, which also increases the likelihood of owner default. In the Great Recession, for example, default rates rose to about 9 percent, up from around 1 percent, as interest rates rose.


For Zerohedge readers, the dual crises affecting regional banks and the commercial real estate sector (offices) isn't a new thesis. We first proposed the coming turmoil on Mar. 21 in a note titled """"Nowhere To Hide In CMBS"": CRE Nuke Goes Off With Small Banks Accounting For 70% Of Commercial Real Estate Loans"". We've documented the unfolding crisis spreading from regional banks to the CRE space in numerous pieces (many of which can be found in our premium section). 

Our latest note, featuring BofA strategist Michael Hartnett highlights ""every Fed tightening cycle ends in crisis.""

The move caused a wider sell-off in stocks and sparked fears that other banks may be at risk of failure.

Here‚Äôs how the crisis unfolded and what it means for the tech and financial sectors.

Founded in 1983, the bank grew to become the 16th-largest in the U.S, with $210 billion in assets. Over the years, according to reports, its client list grew to include some of the biggest names in consumer tech like Airbnb, Cisco, Fitbit, Pinterest and Square.

Why was it shut down?

On Wednesday evening, SVB announced it was planning to raise $2 billion to ‚Äústrengthen [its] financial position‚Äù after suffering losses amid the broader slowdown in tech sector. It also indicated it had seen an increase in startup clients pulling out their deposits. At the same time, the bank signaled that its securities had lost value as a result of higher interest rates.

By Thursday morning, SVB shares began to see a massive sell-off.

Later that day, SVB CEO Gary Becker pleaded with tech investors to ‚Äústay calm.‚Äù He said that the only danger posed to SVB was if ‚Äúeverybody is telling each other that SVB is in trouble.‚Äù

That appears to have morphed into a self-fulfilling prophecy, with tech titans including Peter Thiel reportedly warning startup founders to reduce their exposure to SVB.

By the end of the day, SVB shares had fallen by 60%.

On Friday morning, CNBC reported that SVB had been unable to raise the cash it had been hoping to assemble, and was looking for a buyer as deposit outflows continued to accelerate.

By noon Friday, California state and federal banking regulators had seen enough and announced they were taking over SVB‚Äôs deposits and

According to the FDIC, this is the second largest bank failure since Washington Mutual collapsed in September 2008.

What happens next?

Before the shutdown, some some banking analysts dismissed concerns about a potential ‚Äúcontagion‚Äù stemming from SVB‚Äôs problems that could unsteady the banking sector ‚Äî though without ruling out the possibility that the bank could fail.

‚ÄúWe believe the sell-off was overdone as large banks have a lot more liquidity than smaller banks, they are more diversified with broader business models, have a lot of capital, are much better managed in regards to risk, and have a lot of oversight from regulators,‚Äù JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja said in a note to clients earlier Friday.

Morgan Stanley analysts Manan Gosalia and Betsy Graseck echoed that sentiment, saying in a note Friday morning that the issues appeared ‚Äúhighly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other banks we cover.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, funding is a headwind for the industry,‚Äù they acknowledged, but emphasized that they didn‚Äôt believe at the time that there was a liquidity crunch facing the banking sector.

Regulators‚Äô intervention midday Friday spooked investors and reversed a short-lived recovery in the broader market, with the Dow Jones index down 1.3% in afternoon trading, the S&P down 1.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 2%.

Brad Hargreaves, a startup founder who previously served on boards of companies that did business with SVB, said the bank was unusual in that often played a dual role as corporate and personal lender to CEOs.

Often, he said, SVB tied a company‚Äôs loan to an executive‚Äôs mortgage ‚Äî and that a default on one would trigger a default on the other.

Silicon Valley Bank is to tech what Bank of America is to Main Street, he said, adding, ‚ÄúThey got really integrated into the lives of a lot of founders.‚Äù

Many startup executives whose companies banked with SVB are now also likely facing a payroll crisis, Hargreaves said, because the FDIC is authorized to release only insured deposits of up to $250,000. That heightens the risk that these companies could announce furloughs or layoffs of dozens or even hundreds of employees, he said.

SVB referred requests for comments Friday to the FDIC‚Äôs takeover notice.

Banks typically build up their loan loss provisions when there are concerns borrowers won‚Äôt be able to make their payments.

It‚Äôs not hard to see why they‚Äôre scrambling to prepare. The unrelenting increases in the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve ‚Äî now at 3% to 3.25% ‚Äî has already seen borrowers begin to default on loans, credit card payments and other variable-rate debts.

And by setting aside these massive reserves, banks are signaling they‚Äôre anticipating having to handle more losses in the future as consumers continue to feel the squeeze of rising interest rates and scorching-hot inflation.

What these banks are reacting to

Lenders are already starting to feel the effects of the Fed's fight on inflation. Four of the biggest banks in the country are expected to report losses this week in their quarterly earnings reports, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.

Normally, a higher interest rate would be a good thing for banks ‚Äî their earnings tend to rise with interest rates. But banks are seeing a dip amid the fluctuating markets ‚Äî fewer deals are being made and investors are holding back as warning signs of a recession persist.

And that‚Äôs led many banks to add to their loss reserves.

The amount banks add to their loan loss reserves then gets subtracted from its earnings. Conversely, when a bank releases those reserves, that money is added to its earnings.

Banks and lenders adjust their cash reserves according to the potential losses on their outstanding loans ‚Äî they‚Äôre setting aside money for problem loans that get paid late or not at all. When a loan goes unpaid, a bank will tap into the loss reserves cash to cover it.

When banks release their loan loss provisions, it generally means the economy is healthy and borrowers won‚Äôt have any trouble making payments. When they build them up, it‚Äôs a sign they expect borrowers to have trouble making payments.

Many lenders were forced to bolster their reserves to the tune of tens of billions during the crash in March 2020 when the pandemic hit ‚Äî but in the year that followed, as the economy recovered, they released them. And now they're having to reverse course ‚Äî for good reason.

In the second quarter of this year, JPMorgan reported significant losses and built $428 million in bad loan reserves. The sentiment behind that doesn‚Äôt seem to have changed for the bank.

Earlier this week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned ‚Äúsome kind of recession‚Äù will be coming in six to nine months, according to CNBC.

WellsFargo also saw big losses in the second quarter. The bank reported its profits were halved as it pushed funds to its reserves to cover potential losses.

Those losses are already eating away at bank profits. In the second quarter of 2022, early delinquencies ‚Äî loans 30 to 89 days past due ‚Äî increased $11.4 billion (25%) compared to the same period in 2021, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal banking regulator.

Which means that as the Federal Reserve continues its aggressive fight against inflation, banks seem to expect delinquencies will persist, as consumers and commercial clients have a harder time making payments in a tightened economy.

Since 2020, loan defaults have been muted, partly thanks to pandemic-era stimulus cash and other government assistance that kept default rates low. But lenders are now starting to feel the ill-effects of higher interest rates and inflation on borrowers. Which is why US banks are putting aside more money than usual to deal with potentially bad loans.

In general, b anks with more exposure to rising interest rates are poised to fare better, while those reliant on investment banking, trading, and wealth management are being faced with a more challenging environment.

Today we have a report from the second day of the Bloomberg Invest conference, a three-day event where global leaders in finance gather to gain key insights and information‚Äîand, of course, to kibitz.

""We worry about everything all the time, that is our job,"" John Waldron, the president and COO of Goldman Sachs, said in an interview today. He's among executives considering all the worst-case scenarios for an economy that still hasn't seen the recession many are anticipating.

""When capital reprices this aggressively, things do break,"" Katie Koch, the CEO of TCW, said. There could be huge dislocations that investment managers can dive into, but caution is the byword among some of the top bond fund managers and banking executives in the world.

Koch thinks there's 100% certainty of a recession, because that's how cycles work. She joins investing giants such as Stan Druckenmiller at the Bloomberg Invest conference, who this week doubled down on the idea that a recession could be especially painful given how much easy money has been flooding the system for more than a decade ‚Äî a tide that‚Äôs now washing out as central banks around the world keep hiking interest rates and financial firms in the US pull back on lending.

But not everyone thinks a recession needs to happen in the conventional sense. Goldman's Waldron said there's always a possibility that the economy bounces back in the second half of the year. ‚ÄúThis is the best predicted recession that hasn‚Äôt happened yet ‚Äî and may not happen,‚Äù he said.

But there's another outcome to consider, he says. That's a scenario of mild stagflation where growth is low but inflation is still too high. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to be called a recession, but that‚Äôs not going to feel great,"" he said, given it would mean a prolonged period of sluggish economic expansions. ""Activity levels will be more challenged. That's the scenario we plan for and worry about.""

He thinks an industrial revolution that's more like a digital revolution could help bring some growth into the economy. But for both investment clients and CEOs, business investment might head into a recession and ""risk appetite is lower,"" Waldron said. ""These crosscurrents are complex.""

Anne Walsh, who runs the $224 billion portfolio at Guggenheim Investments, said there could be stranded assets as investors shift their strategies. There are global shifts that could take decades to work through around climate risks and population changes that are causing big bond managers in particular to rethink their holdings.

She thinks there could be ""rolling slowdowns in the economy,"" if there's no recession, as the Federal Reserve pushes to get inflation back down to 2%. She's positioning her investments to being more defensive and ""getting a lot more thoughtful with the credit risk we're willing to take.""

Nassim Taleb, the author of The Black Swan and adviser to hedge fund firm Universa Investments, gave another word of caution. He put forward Credit Suisse's failure as an example, a place where he once had worked. ""I've worked for many firms that have disappeared,"" he said.

""Nobody ever imagined that these firms were not going to be perpetual, so it tells you something about the structure of our world, that when you invest in something, never assume that a AAA is a AAA.""

Taleb is speaking of ultra-safe bonds, rated AAA, whose ratings could fall more quickly than you can imagine. He's not the only one warning that seemingly safe assets can start to go south. TCW's Koch, who sees an ""epic"" opportunity in private credit as billions flow into the industry, still warned of default rates ticking higher.

Saba Capital's Boaz Weinstein also sees a reckoning in that space.

""Private credit, which was a cottage industry a decade ago, a quarter-trillion dollars, is now $1.4-1.5 trillion, and a lot of those companies are going to suffer under the weight of those interest payments,"" he said. ""And it is almost for sure, recession or no recession, the default rate is going to rise."" ‚ÄîSonali Basak, Bloomberg News

It‚Äôs shaken confidence in the embattled regional banking sector and raised concerns that we haven‚Äôt seen the last of bank runs and collapses.

We‚Äôve got the latest on just how bad First Republic‚Äôs earnings report was and Wall Street‚Äôs reaction, how the banking sector is shaping up in the aftermath of the crisis and whether more financial woes might be on the way.

All the uncertainty isn‚Äôt great for investors. Q.ai‚Äôs Foundation Kits could be the tonic you need in an economic downturn. Themed on different topics and risk levels, an AI algorithm looks at the assets set to hit it big each week and weights them accordingly.

The AI sifts through the data so you don‚Äôt have to, helping to keep your investments one step ahead.

There‚Äôs no denying that First Republic‚Äôs first quarter was a bloodbath. The regional bank, headquartered in San Francisco, said its deposits had fallen to $104.5 billion - with that figure including the $30 billion bailout central banks had to provide.

Net income was down 33% year-on-year to $269 million; revenue slid by 13.4% to $1.2 billion, and net interest income was down 19.4% after its interest expense swelled to $974 million from $525 million. It doesn't look good no matter how you slice and dice it.

First Republic also had to borrow a lot of money. Thanks to the crisis, its borrowings now total a huge $106.7 billion, up massively from Q4 2022‚Äôs $5.5 billion figure. To make matters worse, those loans are mostly expensive short-term ones from the Fed.

Founder Jim Herbert and CEO Mike Roffler said in a joint statement that ‚Äúwe continue to take steps to strengthen our business‚Äù and that they were ‚Äúgrateful for the ongoing support of our clients and colleagues‚Äù. That‚Äôs putting it mildly.

The troubled bank also plans to take further steps to ensure it could be profitable by the end of the year, announcing it would be slashing bonuses and pay, cutting back on office space and reducing its workforce by up to 25%. It also cut dividends for the quarter and is likely to do the same in Q2.

First Republic had an unfortunate leading role in the banking crisis that happened in March. After Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs customers caused a bank run and its dramatic collapse, other banks started to feel the heat. Soon, customers were pulling their cash too fast for First Republic to keep up with.

As a result, First Republic needed a $30 billion cash injection to stay afloat or risk deepening the crisis if a third bank was to fail. Central banks stepped up to the plate, with the likes of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America funding the injection.

Investors were already jumpy and looking for any cracks in the banking sector, so these latest earnings revealed the full extent of the damage. Shares in First Republic plummeted 20% on Monday, but the price has recovered 12% so far on Tuesday. Its shares are down 86% this year.

Other regional banks also took a hit. Western Alliance‚Äôs and Zions‚Äô share prices slid 2%, while KeyCorp dropped 0.7%. Western Alliance‚Äôs earnings report was fine, but Zions and KeyCorp missed analyst expectations.

The mixed results are in stark contrast to the central banks, many of which have beaten Wall Street‚Äôs predictions. JPMorgan announced a 52% earnings increase, bolstered by higher interest rates, while Wells Fargo reported a 30% rise in its net income and a 45% rise in net interest income. Citigroup smashed forecasts to hit a $4.6 billion profit, and Bank of America enjoyed a 13% revenue increase and a 15% profit boost.

Is the banking crisis over?

After the second and third-largest bank failures in US history, there was no way everyone would see a full bounceback so quickly. Central banks, particularly the consumer-focused ones, had the room to flex. Regional banks weren‚Äôt so lucky.

There‚Äôs a chance we could be on shaky ground again. On Friday, Moody‚Äôs downgraded 11 regional banks‚Äô ratings, blaming ‚Äúa deterioration in the operating environment and funding conditions‚Äù.

We‚Äôre also just days away from hearing the Fed‚Äôs decision on interest rates. Recently most signs have been pointing to another quarter-point hike, but there‚Äôs a chance the regional banking sector‚Äôs dismal outlook could weigh in on the final say.

Either way, all of the banks are bracing for a recession by tightening lending criteria and increasing provisions for credit defaults. Investors and analysts are paying closer attention to the banks' balance sheets and employee retention figures from now on.

First Republic‚Äôs earnings were never going to be good, but nobody knew how bad the situation was until yesterday. Now everything‚Äôs out in the open, a jumpy Wall Street has reacted as expected. The question is: is that the end of the banking crisis, or will a continued lack of confidence further deepen the banking industry‚Äôs woes?

All seems stable - for now. But as we saw with SVB, confidence can disappear in the blink of an eye. It‚Äôs up to the government and banking professionals to reassure investors and consumers that all‚Äôs well. That might be an uphill battle for the next quarter, but it‚Äôs necessary to ensure the industry's health.

The main concern for Credit Suisse was whether it could restructure its business without the need for additional financing. The most immediate manifestation of this growing concern was the escalating cost of buying Credit Suisse's credit default swaps.

A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative that allows an investor to swap or offset their credit risk with that of another investor. Investors use it to hedge credit risk.

As we can see, Credit Suisse's credit default swap (CDS) costs have significantly outpaced those of UBS, the top Swiss bank, and Credit Suisse, the second largest bank. Credit Suisse's credit default swaps jumped to an all-time high on Monday.

Meanwhile, Credit Suisse's stock has plunged, falling more than 20% in September and has fallen about 60% so far this year.

Credit Suisse has said that it will disclose a sweeping restructuring plan on Oct. 27. It is believed that the bank may sell or shutter parts of its global investment banking franchise as part of that plan. For this, the market has different opinions.

Analysts at Bank of America say that equity financing will be central to the restructuring at this point in time due to the rising cost of debt. If Credit Suisse exits the capital-intensive investment banking business, this will alleviate some of the capital pressure, while also improving its debt financing costs.

Jefferies analysts wrote that asset sales are only a ""partial solution"" because the bank would be a forced seller in a down market. The sales would also cut future earnings and cost 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion Swiss francs in restructuring costs.

KBW analysts wrote that Credit Suisse needs around 6 billion Swiss francs to support its restructuring plan and ""protect from the unknown."" While asset sales will help, about 4 billion Swiss francs of the effort will likely come by selling shares, they said.

While the current situation at Credit Suisse has created some degree of nervousness in the market, most analysts do not see this as a repeat of the Lehman moment and generally believe that the current crisis at Credit Suisse does not pose a risk to the banking system as a whole.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian pointed out that this actually shows the anxiety of investors about the functioning of the market, so many years of repressed interest rates brought about by a variety of problems, finally slowly began to surface.

""So I do not think this is a Lehman moment. It is the market reaction. That's the interesting thing here. And it tells you that there's anxiety not only about the things we knew, tightening financial conditions, and central bank mistakes, slowing global economy, all these other non-economic issues. There's also concern about market functioning. and that's what the UK and Credit Suisse really tell you is that market functioning, after years of repressed interest rates are starting to be an issue.""",CCTV Script 04/10/22,causal,"CNBC, CDS, UK, KBW, UBS, CCTV",['UK'],"['CNBC', 'CCTV']","['CNBC', 'CCTV', 'KBW', 'UBS', 'CDS', 'UK']","['BAC', 'CNBC', 'CCTV', 'KBW', 'UBS', 'CDS', 'UK']",-0.5793157

JP Morgan's acquisition of failed First Republic Bank makes it the most globally systemically important bank (G-SIB) in the U.S. In the Financial Stability Board‚Äôs list of GSIBs, JPMorgan will now be number five, only after the four Chinese G-SIBs.

JPMorgan‚Äôs role in the American financial industry harkens the days of J.P. Morgan rescuing the U.S. government in 1895 and later saving banks in 1913. While JPMorgan‚Äôs acquisition of First Republic may placate markets momentarily, it should bring up important discussions for U.S. legislators, policy makers, and bank regulators. Clearly, the Too Big To Fail problem is now worse than it was in the years running up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

After the California Department of Financial Services and Innovation closed down First Republic Bank this weekend, JPMorgan acquired most of the appointed receiver, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The purchase includes about $173 bn in loans, $30 bn of stocks and bonds at fair value, $92B of deposits ( which includes $25 bn from other big banks), and $28 bn of Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBs). The FDIC is providing loss-share agreements and $50 bn in financing; JP Morgan did not disclose the rate in this morning analyst call. JPMorgan will pay the FDIC $10.6 bn, which means netting about a $2.6 bn after-tax gain.

Risk To Look Out For

Investors and bank regulators should take out a magnifying glass and look carefully at JPMorgan‚Äôs increased operation risk exposures. Operational risk is the potential loss in earnings due to problems with people, process, systems, and external events. JPMorgan will now have to spend time really taking a look at how it will integrate people, technology, and data from First Republic Bank. Given the First Republic failed due to serious mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risks, JPMorgan will have to comb through all of First Republic banks‚Äô policies, processes, and data quality. JPMorgan should use its own internal auditors and compliance officers to conduct serious due diligence of First Republic assets and liability.

Determining JPMorgan‚Äôs added interest rate risk is also important to note. A significant amount of First Republic's loan book consisted of jumbo mortgages. It will be important to monitor how the current higher interest rate environment will impact the mark-to-market on these relatively illiquid assets. JPMorgan will share this loss with the FDIC; the question is how much.

Also, due to JPMorgan's even more enormous size and added complexity, the bank‚Äôs regulators, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are likely to require it to increase its G-SIB capital surcharge to help it sustain unexpected losses. Given JPMorgan‚Äôs significant interconnections to other financial institutions and the American economy, it is more important than ever that it is more capitalized.

Clearly, the Too Big To Fail problem in the U.S. is not only alive and well but is now an even bigger problem for the financial industry and the American government. Some analysts have stated that the First Republic Bank failure is idiosyncratic. Three banks have failed in the U.S. in less than 2 months. This is serious. What may not end up being idiosyncratic is poor risk management amongst regional banks. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Corporation all had weak interest rate risk identification, asset/liability gap measurement problems, & were not required to calculate and report the liquidity coverage ratio, a measurement of a bank‚Äôs liquidity in a stressed environment. Bank regulators will have to step up enforcement against banks when examiners and off-site supervisors uncover problems. The treasure trove of documents released by the Federal Reserve last Friday proves that Silicon Valley Bank had problems going back to 2016! The American people cannot afford bank failures. Those empowered with enforcement authority at state and national bank regulatory entities need to act now before more banks fail.

That isn‚Äôt a license to speed like crazy, though.

Among subprime auto borrowers, delinquency rates that were quite low during the pandemic have moved well past normal. Executives at Equifax on Thursday told analysts that delinquency rates for subprime auto borrowers aren‚Äôt only above prepandemic levels, they are above the levels reached after the 2008 financial crisis in 2009 and 2010.

The biggest auto lenders will steer clear of this, because they have portfolios tilted much more toward more reliable borrowers. Even so, delinquency rates and losses are rising for higher-quality portfolios, too. Ally Financial this past week said it is now predicting a retail auto net charge-off rate of 1.8% this year, which was at the top end of its previously given range. This is versus a historical average for 2017 to 2019 of around 1.4%. Capital One Financial‚Äôs COF 0.50%increase; green up pointing triangle auto net charge-off rate was 1.4% in the second quarter, up 0.79 percentage point from a year earlier.

Amid all that, some lenders are pulling over. This has opened up more of an opportunity to profitably lend in auto‚Äîeven by picking off only the best borrowers. Ally told analysts on Wednesday that potential returns on super-prime loans were ‚Äúsignificantly higher than normal.‚Äù Capital One Financial said on Thursday that though it had its ‚Äúfoot on the brake‚Äù in auto for a while, ‚Äúin the very recent months, we‚Äôve seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more.‚Äù

This comes as banks such as Fifth Third and U.S. Bancorp this past week said they have been selling or scaling back auto loans. There has also been a sharp contraction among credit unions, whose aggressive pricing had previously been making things harder for bank lenders. Cox Automotive‚Äôs Dealertrack Auto Credit Availability Index in June showed a nearly 17% decrease year-over-year by credit unions, versus just a 7.5% pullback among banks.

The best customers default less often. But they also command lower interest rates, pressuring lending yields. Ally told analysts that its ‚Äúoriginated yield declined in the quarter as we‚Äôve increased the superprime proportion of our volume.‚Äù Those yields will need to stay relatively high to prevent rising funding costs from squeezing profitability further. It also puts the onus on credit performance to help keep returns as high as possible.

Plus, credit risk even for better borrowers may be hard to predict right now. For one, there is the risk that used-car prices decline more than anticipated, making it harder to recover as much on a loan when selling a repossessed car. That is on top of other unprecedented developments in the auto market, like the number of borrowers who now have monthly car payments above $1,000, due to a combination of higher car prices and rising interest rates. Even the well-heeled may balk at this kind of spending.

More broadly, Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank on Thursday described what he called a ‚Äúdeferred charge-off effect.‚Äù Because credit performance over the past three years was so unprecedented across consumer credit, he said that there is likely ‚Äúsome catching up that happens on the other side of that, especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged-off over the past three years.‚Äù That includes the question of who exactly is a prime borrower, with Fairbank noting that rising savings rates meant a lot more subprime customers had moved into prime in recent years, possibly creating misleading data for credit models.

Uncertainty about the health of regional banks and rising yields in the money market led to a steady outflow of deposits, bringing banks' balance sheets to their knees.

The primary beneficiaries of this situation are large banks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), as they are trusted more.

CEO Jamie Dimon is aware of this fact and warned, not entirely disinterestedly, at JPM's Investor Day on Monday that further turmoil in the banking sector is to be expected. Although JPM, as a bedrock in U.S. banking history, has seen its fair share of turmoil, Dimon could not reassure investors that even he cannot say what impact the current Fed monetary policy will have:

""We've never had QT before. It just started, okay? And you see huge distortions in the marketplace already. We've never had the Fed in the market like this with that RRP program that Jeremy mentioned ever. They have $2.3 trillion basically lent out to money funds. And I don't know the full effect of that. And obviously, that's a direct deduction from deposits are rolling out it made sense to do.""

The JPM CEO pointed out during his presentation that the acquisition of First Republic Bank (OTC:FRCB) was a fluke for investors. This is because JPM did not acquire all of its businesses, but only the most profitable ones, from which it continues to profit even as interest rates continue to rise.

That's why Dimon was also able to announce at the investor day that net interest income this year will be $84 billion instead of $81 billion.

According to Dimon, the current situation will inevitably lead to banks raising the bar for lending. Especially in the commercial real estate sector, things are looking increasingly bleak. That's because, according to Goldman Sachs) economists, 80 percent of those loans are made by regional banks. That is, from those institutions that have suffered the most from the monetary policy of the Fed and the outflow of capital. As CNN reported, Dimon said:

""You‚Äôre already seeing credit tighten up because the easiest way for a bank to retain capital is not to make the next loan,""

The JPM CEO is convinced that the situation will get worse, because contrary to market expectations that the Fed has reached the upper end of its interest rates, he expects higher interest rates, as he explained:

""I think everyone should be prepared for rates going higher from here. You should be prepared for 6 or 7 percent.""

New figures showed that more than $450m was withdrawn from Credit Suisse‚Äôs US and European managed funds between 13 and 15 March as retail and institutional investors pulled their money from the embattled lender, according to data from Morningstar Direct.

US bank First Republic also suffered a 25% fall in its share price, despite it securing a $30bn injection of emergency funds from America‚Äôs largest banks in a deal put together by the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.

Growing unease in the market ‚Äì which saw America‚Äôs Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapse ‚Äì led the European Central Bank (ECB) to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the tumult.

The ECB supervisors ‚Äì who have held two unplanned meetings this week ‚Äì saw no contagion to eurozone banks, a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters. Banking deposits across the sector were said to be stable. The ECB declined to comment.

German finance minister Christian Lindner also sought to reassure investors and the public that there was not a ‚Äúsystemic financial crisis‚Äù and said the current situation was not likely to lead to a repeat of 2008.

Lindner said Bafin, Germany‚Äôs financial watchdog, and the Bundesbank, its central bank, were ‚Äúclosely and carefully‚Äù observing the situation, which he said was marked by specific problems at individual banks. ‚ÄúIt is not a systemic financial crisis. The situation is therefore different from 2008,‚Äù he told Sueddeutsche Zeitung.

US president Joe Biden on Friday called on Congress to allow regulators to impose tougher penalties on the executives of failed banks, including clawing back pay and bonuses and making it easier to bar them from working in the industry again.

‚ÄúNo one is above the law ‚Äî and strengthening accountability is an important deterrent to prevent mismanagement in the future,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúCongress must act to impose tougher penalties for senior bank executives whose mismanagement contributed to their institution failing.‚Äù

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) can only claw back the compensation of banking executives if they act with ‚Äúrecklessness‚Äù or ‚Äúwillful or continuing disregard‚Äù for their bank‚Äôs health. Biden wants Congress to allow the regulator to impose penalties for ‚Äúnegligent‚Äù executives ‚Äî a lower legal threshold.

America‚Äôs largest banks on Thursday night agreed to pump $30bn of emergency funds into First Republic, a San Francisco-based bank which experts warned could also have been teetering on the brink of collapse.

However, the rescue deal cobbled together by Yellen, Powell and JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, failed to reassure investors. First Republic‚Äôs shares, which have lost three-quarters of their value since Wednesday, fell by 25% on Friday.

In a joint statement, the 11 banks which stumped up the money, who included Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, said: ‚ÄúThe actions of America‚Äôs largest banks reflect their confidence in the country‚Äôs banking system.

‚ÄúTogether, we are deploying our financial strength and liquidity into the larger system, where it is needed the most.‚Äù

However, billionaire activist hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said the injection of funds was a ‚Äúfictional vote of confidence‚Äù and warned of serious concern that ‚Äúfinancial contagion risk[s] spiralling out of control and causing severe economic damage and hardship‚Äù.

‚ÄúYellen has apparently pushed the SIBs [systemically important banks] to recycle some of the deposits they received from First Republic [Bank] back into FRB for 120 days,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe result is that FRB default risk is now being spread to our largest banks.‚Äù

In total, banks have borrowed about $300bn from the US Federal Reserve in the past week, the central bank said. Nearly half the money ‚Äì $143bn ‚Äì went to holding companies for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

            By Vishwanath Tirupattur, Betsy L. Graseck, Morgan Stanley strategist, as excepted from Sunday Start

After 2Q bank earnings, we wrote about the regulatory capital challenges facing US banks (particularly the large caps) and the implications for risk markets, especially fixed income. Using insights from Betsy Graseck, our banks and consumer finance equity analyst, we noted that banks would need to keep dividends flat, eliminate buybacks, and reduce risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to generate a capital ratio above their required minimums, while making tough choices in their lending books. For the three largest banks (JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America, and Citigroup), it meant lowering their RWAs by more than US$150 billion in aggregate by year end to maintain a 100bp management buffer on top of their regulatory capital minimums. We expected different reactions to RWA pressures across the banks, but in aggregate we looked for lower credit formation, reduced market liquidity and continued pressure on spreads for capital-intensive assets.

After banks reported 3Q earnings this week, we take a fresh look at bank capital, the banks‚Äô strategies to address these challenges, and their effect on fixed income markets. The good news is that the three largest banks have made notable progress on the RWA front, reducing their RWAs by about $90 billion. With these reductions and other factors such as strong net income, Bank of America has met its RWA reduction needs, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup have completed two-thirds and one-third, respectively, to maintain a 100bp capital buffer. While JPM management has suggested that it might only run with a 50bp buffer, we view that as thin and see it easily increasing to historical 100bp levels if macroeconomic and FX volatility persist.

The progress in RWA reduction is not without costs. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs H.8 data show a notable deceleration in loan growth across banks in aggregate ‚Äì the Q/Q change fell from US$454 billion in 2Q to $240 billion in 3Q. The deceleration at the largest three banks was notably greater, and their share of the overall loan market ‚Äì auto, credit card, HELOC, CRE, residential mortgage and C&I loans combined ‚Äì dropped, mainly as a result of RWA reductions. In the most recent Senior Loan Officer survey, every question on lending conditions flipped to tightening, further evidence of how US banks are approaching their lending books.



What about market liquidity in secondary markets?

Amid the forced selling dynamic in US corporate credit on the back of the volatility in the UK markets, the issue has received much attention. Condensing liquidity to a single measure is hard. Bid-offer spreads in credit are one measure of liquidity. Even though secondary markets in corporate credit have been largely well behaved, bid-offer spreads for credit have widened from the lows of 2021, suggesting deteriorating market liquidity. In our view, RWA pressures on dealer balance sheets have contributed to this widening.

The deterioration of market liquidity is by no means limited to corporate credit markets. The effects of RWA reduction are more pronounced in securitized product markets, with banks reducing their footprint in trading and their portfolio assets with higher RWAs. Banks have traditionally been major buyers in their portfolios of conventional agency MBS and AAA tranches of securitized products such as CLOs, both of which carry a 20% risk weight. Agency MBS, which are backed by the US government, have virtually no credit risk. Senior tranches of securitized products like CLOs are structured to be credit-risk remote and their structural resilience has been tested over multiple default cycles. Banks are not big buyers of corporate bonds.

Comparing the moves in corporate credit spreads with agency MBS and CLO AAAs illustrates their relative dependency on bank buying. As shown in Exhibit 1, spreads on agency MBS and CLO AAAs currently sit at or near the wides of their post-Covid ranges, while corporate credit spreads are around the middle of the range. Spreads have widened meaningfully in products that need bank sponsorship ‚Äì in our view, a direct consequence of RWA reductions.



What does this mean for investors? First, there is more wood to chop on the RWA front, which means the deceleration in loan growth will likely continue in 4Q. Second, market turbulence (e.g., the recent volatility in UK markets) in one market could magnify the moves in other markets. Thus, low liquidity will likely remain a headwind to the smooth functioning of markets. Third, the incrementally greater widening in certain spread products thanks to bank buyers stepping away could create an opportunity for investors that do not face the same capital pressures. The fundamentals of these instruments have not changed but market valuations are cheaper for reasons that are not grounded in fundamentals.

The U.S. banking system has been under pressure since the sudden collapse and seizure of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVBQ) by the FDIC on March 10. The challenge of analyzing bank safety is that a severe loss of confidence can actually cause an otherwise functioning financial institution to come under duress. Weekly data released by the Federal Reserve indicate that stresses remain in the banking system, but we seem to have removed the systemic threat. Aside from the market pricing data and government money market mutual funds asset flows, the bank data come from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs weekly reports, released Thursday and Friday.

Despite the debt ceiling worries, the bank indexes outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin last week for the first time since the banking crisis began. The proximate cause of the sharp rally in banks, particularly the regional banks, was an announcement by Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) that deposits had risen by over $2 billion since April. In addition, Western Alliance noted that extra liquidity would be provided by the ‚Äúimminent‚Äù sale of about $3 billion in loans. Western Alliance‚Äôs stock price had been more than cut in half before a breathtaking rally of almost 25% last week.

The KBW Regional Bank index is down over 28% year-to-date. As measured by the KBW Bank index, larger bank stocks declined almost 24% year-to-date.

Credit default swap (CDS) prices are less well-known but available in real-time. In simple terms, CDS functions as an insurance policy that investors can purchase that pays off in the event of a borrower‚Äôs default. A higher price of a CDS reflects a more significant probability of default of the borrower. CDS prices for four of the U.S.‚Äôs global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) improved last week and are near their lowest levels since this crisis began. Generally, the view is that the mega banks are safe and might benefit from the deposit flight from and worries about the smaller banks.

A straightforward way to measure the stress in the U.S. banking system is the magnitude of bank support provided by the Federal Reserve via various facilities. The most common is the discount window, which banks generally avoid, but the facility can provide emergency liquidity. In addition, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Federal Reserve announced a new facility to help banks meet withdrawal requests from depositors and restore confidence. The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) allows banks to borrow up the face value of any government bonds held in the bank‚Äôs portfolio at a very reasonable rate. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) facility was created in 2020 to provide support during the pandemic. Other credit is the support of the bridge banks, operated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) until they can be sold or liquidated.

With the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank , discount window and bridge bank credit usage soared. The recent significant shift from discount window borrowing to the bridge bank is related to the failure of First Republic. The credit used by the bridge banks declined as the FDIC made some headway in winding down the failed banks. Overall, the decreased Fed bank lending across its facilities for three weeks in a row evidences some healing. Still, the uptick in BTFP usage illustrates that stresses remain in the system.

Unfortunately, the banking system saw net deposit outflows across large and small banks. Notably, the 25 largest banks, which include many midsize regional banks, have lost about 1.8% of their deposit base since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while the smaller banks lost 4.6%.

Government money market funds saw inflows again last week at a similar pace to the previous week. Cash has been flowing into government money market funds, which confirmed the pressure on deposits to leave the banking system. Notably, the pace of inflows into government money market funds has moderated significantly since the apex of the banking crisis. This movement, also known as ‚Äúcash sorting,‚Äù reflects savers reaching for higher yields while avoiding the credit risk at banks. Cash sorting started before the crisis began but seems likely to continue to some degree while short-term U.S. Treasury yields exceed the interest rates banks pay depositors.

Banks have continued to make loans despite the crisis, but total bank lending declined last week, driven primarily by a decline in business (C&I) loans from the large banks. Loan growth should be expected to slow if banks are forced to hoard extra liquidity to bolster their defenses against possible additional deposit flight and increased loan losses.

The evidence remains inconclusive that any significant loan rationing from the banks is occurring yet, even if it seems a likely outcome of the crisis. So far, all that can be pointed to is a moderation in the pace of increase in bank loans year-over-year, though the deceleration of commercial real estate (CRE) loans is notable. Most commercial real estate loans are provided by smaller banks, which are the ones most threatened by this banking crisis, so that remains an area of concern.

The negotiations to raise the debt ceiling seemed to progress last week, but they broke down on Friday. President Biden‚Äôs absence from Washington to attend the G7 Summit in Japan has likely complicated matters, and negotiations are not expected to begin again until he returns today (Sunday). The good news is that both sides know time is running out, as the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs general account is running low. Since this is a negotiation with each side trying to use its political leverage, these things are usually dragged out until the last minute.

The principal thing to remember is that any debt ceiling crisis is a manufactured political crisis rather than a lack of ability to pay the U.S. government‚Äôs debt. This debt ceiling argument is a political fight in which each side thinks it can extract something from the other. While a possible default on U.S. debt will be discussed in the news if an agreement is not reached as extraordinary measures are exhausted, a default is virtually certain not to happen. Existing law does not stop the U.S. Treasury from prioritizing payments, and according to Strategas, the U.S. has more than enough cash flow to make interest payments. Investors should be prepared for stock and bond volatility, but any significant declines driven by the conflict will likely be an opportunity for long-term investors.

With the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank , discount window and bridge bank credit usage soared. Previously, there was a significant shift from discount window borrowing to using the bank term funding program (BTFP). This week, discount window and BTFP usage rose for the first time since the peak of the banking crisis. In addition, the credit used by the bridge banks was unchanged as the FDIC made no headway in winding down the failed banks. Overall, the increase in Fed bank lending across all two available facilities for two weeks in a row is a flashing yellow light. Still, the banking crisis seems unlikely to devolve into a systemic panic again currently.

There were bank deposit outflows across large and small banks. Notably, the 25 largest banks, which include many midsize regional banks, have lost about 1% of their deposit base since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while the smaller banks lost almost 4%.

As noted last week, this week‚Äôs outflows are almost certainly related to tax payments. U.S. banking system deposits fell by over $350 billion during tax season in 2022. The deposit flows will be crucial to watch again next week after tax season has passed.

Government money market funds saw inflows. The money market data is provided at less of a lag than the Federal Reserve‚Äôs bank data, which could signal additional future movement out of the banks and some worries related to First Republic Bank. Cash has been flowing into government money market funds, which confirmed the pressure on deposits to leave the banking system. Notably, the pace of inflows into government money market funds has moderated significantly since the apex of the banking crisis. This movement, also known as ‚Äúcash sorting,‚Äù reflects savers reaching for higher yields while avoiding the credit risk at banks. Cash sorting started before the crisis began but seems likely to continue to some degree while short-term U.S. Treasury yields exceed the interest rates banks pay depositors.

Banks have continued to make loans despite the crisis, and total bank lending grew this week, driven by large and small banks. Loan growth should be expected to slow if banks are forced to hoard extra liquidity to bolster their defenses against possible additional deposit flight and increased loan losses.

The first signs of a potential credit crunch in commercial real estate (CRE) lending appeared a few weeks ago when lending to that segment fell the most on record. CRE lending from small banks was again higher this week, though.

Smaller banks are the leading provider of commercial real estate loans, so that sector could face less credit available if the deposit drain continues at those banks.

Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, which are business loans, rose this week after declining at all banks over the previous four weeks. The analysis of the current period is complicated by the massive swings in loans during the pandemic. The recent picture is flattered by easy comparisons, but the year-over-year pace in business loans has been headed lower. History shows that year-over-year declines in C&I loans are generally associated with an economic recession.

In summary, while the large deposit outflow is related to tax season, the seemingly imminent seizure of First Republic Bank and increased usage in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs bank support facilities shows that the banking crisis continues to smolder. The U.S. banking system has improved from the extremes of the situation but needs to be monitored closely for signs of a reversion to the panic phase. It will be instructive to watch post-tax season bank deposits next week. While bank loans grew this week, a higher probability of a U.S. recession in 2023 will be the intermediate-term result of the banking crisis if credit is constricted.",First Republic Bank And Fed Data Illustrate A Still-Smoldering Banking Crisis,non-causal,"FRC, BTFP, FDIC, CDS, PNC, PPP, KBW, JPM, CRE","['JPM', 'U', 'FRC', 'S', 'G', 'P', 'PNC']",[],"['JPM', 'FDIC', 'FRC', 'CRE', 'KBW', 'CDS', 'PPP', 'BTFP', 'PNC']","['JPM', 'U', 'FDIC', 'FRC', 'S', 'G', 'CRE', 'KBW', 'P', 'CDS', 'PPP', 'BTFP', 'PNC']",0.98318005

‚Ä¢ None Have policymakers done enough to avert a system-wide crisis?
‚Ä¢ None How could the situation escalate?
‚Ä¢ None What does all of this mean for monetary policy?

""The most immediate question is how markets digest news of the UBS deal to buy Credit Suisse,"" wrote Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.

Late Sunday, UBS (UBS) announced a deal to acquire Credit Suisse (CS) for a little over $3 billion, news that sent shares of Credit Suisse down about 50% on Monday while UBS reversed early losses.

Shearing said elements of UBS' agreement are not entirely clear, with the discounted value of $3.25 billion suggesting, ""a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570 [billion in] assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired.""

""This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks,"" Shearing wrote.

Still, Shearing notes crises like what markets face today don't tend to come and go in quick bouts.

""Containing crises is a bit like a game of whack-a-mole ‚Äî with new fires starting as existing ones are extinguished. A key issue over the next week will be whether problems arise in other institutions or parts of the financial system,"" Shearing wrote.

Whether the banking crisis escalates, in Shearing's view, hinges on any additional unknown unknowns that emerge from the system as the result of aggressively rising interest rates.

""While it's tempting to dismiss the problems at SVB, Signature Bank and Credit Suisse as idiosyncratic, they have revealed that problems are lurking in the financial system as interest rates rise,"" Shearing wrote.

""Key areas to monitor include smaller European banks and shadow banks, particularly open-ended funds that might suffer from maturity mismatches.""

As Yahoo Finance's Dan Fitzpatrick outlined over the weekend, some $600 billion in ""unrealized"" credit losses are lurking in the U.S. banking system. But these losses, as Shearing notes, are largely the result of banks failing to manage interest rate risk, rather than extending credit to bad borrowers.

""Credit Suisse aside, the problems so far have been caused by a failure to adequately manage interest rate risk,"" Shearing wrote. ""An altogether more serious crisis would develop if credit risks start to emerge ‚Äî or, to put it differently, if loan default rates rise as banks' asset quality deteriorates.

Which brings in the top concern from investors this week: What will the Fed do?

As of mid-morning on Monday, markets are pricing in a ~70% chance the Fed raises rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, according to data from the CME Group.

Prior to the crisis, investors placed a better-than-50% chance on the Fed raising rates by 50 basis points this month.

""This is a perilously difficult path for central banks to tread,"" Shearing said, adding last week's developments prove money, credit, and the financial sector are just as important factors as macro data like inflation and jobs when it comes to the Fed's policy play.

""While the exact implications of recent events for monetary policy are still unclear, it is likely to mean that interest rates will be lower than the markets had anticipated a couple of weeks ago,"" he predicted.

The initial panic has settled into a more tolerable state of tension. We can all take a deep breath, knowing our money is safe and that banks have the tools they need, courtesy of the federal government, to weather the storm.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going from flashing red lights to flashing yellow lights,‚Äù Wells Fargo‚Äôs senior bank analyst Mike Mayo told me recently. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for hyper awareness and vigilance to anything else‚Äù that might further undermine confidence.

Regulators and investors are certainly on high alert. And they don‚Äôt have to look too far to find things to worry about.

Here‚Äôs the deal: SVB‚Äôs red flags ‚Äî its breakneck growth, lax risk management, and over-reliance on uninsured deposits, among other things ‚Äî should have been easy to spot before its collapse. Now, everyone‚Äôs looking for the next risk hiding in plain sight.

A consensus is forming around three key areas that analysts fear could create a systemic problem ‚Äî commercial real estate, underwater bond portfolios, and the industry with the most metal moniker ever, shadow banks.

The toll of the WFH era

Commercial real estate ‚Äî offices, apartment complexes, warehouses and malls ‚Äî has come under substantial pressure, my colleague Julia Horowitz reports. Commercial property valuations could fall by roughly 20% to 25% this year, according to Rich Hill, head of real estate strategy at Cohen & Steers. For offices, declines could be even steeper, topping 30%.

Office properties are a particular pain point here. The average occupancy of offices in the United States is still less than half their March 2020 levels, according to data from security provider Kastle.

About $270 billion in commercial real estate loans held by banks will come due in 2023. Nearly a third of that, $80 billion, is on office properties.

Signs of strain are increasing. The proportion of commercial office mortgages where borrowers are behind with payments is rising, according to Trepp, which provides data on commercial real estate, and high-profile defaults are making headlines. Earlier this year, a landlord owned by asset manager PIMCO defaulted on nearly $2 billion in debt for seven office buildings in San Francisco; New York City; Boston and Jersey City, New Jersey.

This is a potential problem for banks, given their extensive lending to the sector. Goldman Sachs estimates that 55% of US office loans sit on bank balance sheets. Regional and community banks ‚Äî already under pressure after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March ‚Äî account for 23% of the total.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm more concerned than I‚Äôve been in a long time,‚Äù said Matt Anderson, managing director at Trepp.

Back when interest rates were near zero, US banks gobbled up long-dated Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. (And, typically, that‚Äôs a safe move if you make sure to hedge against the risk of those assets losing value ‚Äî which SVB did not.)

But as the Fed and other central banks have raised interest rates aggressively, the value of those bonds has been eroded.

US banks are now sitting on an estimated $620 billion in unrealized losses ‚Äî their assets are worth less now than they paid for them, making it a problem if the bank is forced to sell those assets in a crisis (like, say, a bank run).

That $620 billion is a conservative estimate, experts say. And it remains unclear where those unrealized losses loom ‚Äî whether they are spread out across the sector or concentrated among certain kinds of lenders.

As we discussed here last week, shadow banking refers to financial institutions that lend out money (like a bank) but don‚Äôt take deposits from customers.

They‚Äôre a large and diverse cast that includes investment banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, private equity funds, all manner of Wall Street power players.

The menacing nickname can be interpreted widely. They‚Äôre in the shadows because they‚Äôre unregulated, sure. But are they, like shady? Yes and no. Hedge funds and private equity types get a bad rap that is sometimes deserved, but they also provide financing to young firms that can‚Äôt get the time of day from regular bank-banks.

The key thing to remember is they‚Äôre not subject to the same strict rules as banks are, meaning they can take on more risk. They also don‚Äôt get the benefit of a government backstop if the wheels start to come off.

But bank-banks and non-banks overlap in all kinds of real and perceived ways, and when confidence is eroded on either side, that creates a potential for panic to spread.

The mere perception that the banking sector might be connected to a struggling non-bank could spark a broader financial crisis, as my colleague Anna Cooban explains.

One of the many troubling reminders to emerge from the SVB debacle is that banks are big, sprawling operations run by human beings, in service of other human beings, none of whom are entirely rational. That might seem simplistic, but it‚Äôs especially relevant for an industry as uniquely reliant on trust as banking is.

‚ÄúThis is not a zero-defect industry,‚Äù Mayo says. ‚ÄúThis is an industry that tries to minimize losses of mistakes, just like any other industry‚Ä¶The reality is that there are going to be mistakes.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúThis is a time when banks can reinforce the importance of their most important asset, which is trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is necessary to strengthen the financial risk disposal mechanism and capacity building, strengthen monitoring, early warning and evaluation,‚Äù said the Chinese central bank.

PBOC chief executive Yang Gi said in early March, before the SVB implosion captured worldwide headlines, that China had already shuttered over 300 of its 600 ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù institutions since the beginning of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. PBOC envisioned further reducing the number of high-risk banks to under 200 by 2025, bringing their numbers down to less than one percent of all Chinese banks.

China began cracking down on risk institutions before the pandemic broke out, in part because a growing number of such institutions were not submitting financial reports on time. For example, Chinese regulators took control of an institution called Baosheng Bank in 2019 and then forced it into bankruptcy because a billionaire named Xiao Jianhua was allegedly using it as an ‚ÄúATM‚Äù to pour money into dubious business propositions.

Before that, Chinese Communist regulators were worried about ‚Äúshadow banking,‚Äù a term for financial institutions that lured customers into risky investment schemes with false promises of security. Shadow banking tended to flourish during times when Chinese customers could not make investments or take loans from larger institutions.

Some of these dicey investment plans were little better than the schemes of Bernie Madoff or Charles Ponzi, using the money from new investors to pay ‚Äúdividends‚Äù while capital ran dangerously low. This created the same sort of cascade default risk that American analysts fear as they watch the flaming ruins of SVB crash to the Earth, but Beijing indulged shadow banking practices for decades because much of the investment money flowed into projects desired by the government.

Chinese state media on Wednesday confidently predicted SVB‚Äôs collapse would not seriously impact China‚Äôs financial system, and no failure of comparable size could ever occur in China, but China would still ‚Äúearnestly learn from this lesson, and always prioritize risk prevention and control.‚Äù",China Reduces Number of High-Risk Financial Institutions to Defuse SVB 'Bombs',non-causal,"PBOC, SVB","['PBOC', 'SVB']",['SVB'],"['PBOC', 'SVB']","['SIVBQ', 'PBOC', 'SVB']",-0.96944535

While analysis shows U.S. banks to be solvent overall, the concern about banks remained and became a global phenomenon. The challenge of analyzing bank safety is that a severe loss of confidence can actually cause an otherwise functioning financial institution to come under duress. This analysis uses a systematic methodology to monitor the strains on the banking system weekly via the U.S. Banking System Stress Monitor. Aside from the market pricing data and government money market mutual funds asset flows, the bank data come from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs H.4.1 and H.8 weekly reports, released on Thursday and Friday, respectively.

This week regional banks outperformed the S&P 500 for the first time since the crisis began. The megabanks have been supported by better-than-expected earnings and supportive forward guidance to start the earnings reporting season. The smaller bank earnings have generally not been as impressive but still were better than the dire expectations following the start of the banking crisis. Despite the better performance this week, the KBW Regional Bank index is down almost 21% year-to-date. As measured by the KBW Bank index, larger bank stocks declined nearly 17% year-to-date.

Credit default swap (CDS) prices are less well-known but available in real time. In simple terms, CDS functions as an insurance policy that investors can purchase that pays off in the event of a borrower‚Äôs default. A higher price of a CDS reflects a more significant probability of default of the borrower. CDS prices for four of the U.S.‚Äôs global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) fell and are at the lowest level since this crisis began.

A straightforward way to measure the stress in the U.S. banking system is the magnitude of bank support provided by the Federal Reserve via various facilities. The most common is the discount window, which banks generally avoid, but the facility can provide emergency liquidity. In addition, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Federal Reserve announced a new facility to help banks meet withdrawal requests from depositors and restore confidence. The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) allows banks to borrow up the face value of any government bonds held in the bank‚Äôs portfolio at a very reasonable rate. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) facility was created in 2020 to provide support during the pandemic. Other credit is the support of the bridge banks, operated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) until they can be sold or liquidated.

With the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank , discount window and bridge bank credit usage soared. Previously, there was a significant shift from discount window borrowing to using the bank term funding program (BTFP). This week, discount window and BTFP usage rose for the first time since the peak of the banking crisis. In addition, the credit used by the bridge banks was unchanged as the FDIC made no headway in winding down the failed banks. Overall, the increase in Fed bank lending across all two available facilities is a small yellow light, but the odds are that the impact of the banking crisis is still receding.

There were bank deposit outflows across large, small, and foreign-related banks. Notably, the 25 largest banks, which include many midsize regional banks, gained deposits since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while the smaller banks and the overall banking system lost deposits.

This week‚Äôs outflow seems likely to be related to tax payments. U.S. banking system deposits fell by over $350 billion during tax season in 2022, so it would seem likely that further outflows should also be seen in next week‚Äôs report.

Government money market funds also saw outflows which bolsters the case that the decline in bank deposits was related to tax payments. Aside from the distortion from tax day, cash had been flowing into government money market funds, which confirmed the pressure on deposits to leave the banking system. Notably, the pace of inflows into government money market funds has moderated significantly since the apex of the banking crisis. This movement, also known as ‚Äúcash sorting,‚Äù reflects savers reaching for higher yields while avoiding the credit risk at banks. Cash sorting started before the crisis began but seems likely to continue to some degree while short-term U.S. Treasury yields exceed the interest rates banks pay depositors.

Banks continued to make loans despite the crisis, but total bank lending was negative again this week, driven by large and foreign-related banks. Loan growth should be expected to slow if banks are forced to hoard extra liquidity to bolster their defenses against possible additional deposit flight and increased loan losses.

The first signs of a potential credit crunch in commercial real estate (CRE) lending appeared a few weeks ago when lending to that segment fell the most on record. CRE lending from small banks was again slightly higher this week. Smaller banks are the leading provider of commercial real estate loans, so that sector could face less credit availability.

Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, which are business loans, have also declined at all banks over the past four weeks. C&I loans are generally viewed as tied to economic activity, so some combination of economic headwinds and tightening credit conditions at banks could be driving these declines.

In summary, despite some small yellow flashing lights this week, the U.S. banking system has improved from the extremes of the crisis. Small and large banks had deposit outflows, likely related to tax season. Perhaps a bit more worrisome is the slight increase in usage of Fed bank facilities, as the tax-related withdrawals could be increasing pressure on some banks again. Based on the 2022 tax season, there will probably be more deposit outflows in next week‚Äôs data, so it will be interesting to see if banks need to lean on Fed support facilities to a greater degree to meet withdrawal demands. While the severity of the banking crisis has receded, business loans from banks have contracted for four straight weeks. Some combination of economic headwinds and tightening credit conditions at banks could be driving these declines in business loans. If the deposit outflows continue to cause a restriction in the availability of bank credit, a U.S. recession will be more likely in 2023.",A Warning Sign From The Banking System But With Tax Season Distortions,non-causal,"BTFP, FDIC, CDS, PPP, KBW, CRE","['U', 'S', 'G', 'P', 'H']",[],"['FDIC', 'CRE', 'KBW', 'CDS', 'PPP', 'BTFP']","['U', 'FDIC', 'S', 'G', 'CRE', 'SBNY', 'KBW', 'P', 'CDS', 'PPP', 'H', 'BTFP']",0.50729656

Fifteen years later, Credit Suisse Group AG found itself on a similar precipice. The Swiss lender, weakened by a series of scandals, had seen its already-low share price fall even further after the failure in recent days of two U.S. banks, SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O).

So, when Saudi National Bank (1180.SE) Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy said his bank, the largest investor in Credit Suisse, could not give it more money, investors ran for the exits.

It didn't matter that Saudi National Bank also gave a reason - further investment would leave it with more than 10% of Credit Suisse's shares, a regulatory hurdle - and that it said it was happy with the Swiss bank's turnaround plan.

Nor did it matter that Credit Suisse Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner had been out over the past few days trying to reassure investors that the bank was strong, with enough capital and liquidity.

By the time traders in New York were switching on screens on Wednesday, Credit Suisse had lost more than a fifth of its value. Its five-year credit default swaps, an indicator of credit stress, spiked to a new record high.

The Swiss lender, investors saw, was not only much bigger than the regional U.S. banks that had failed in the past few days, but it was also an important cog in global financial plumbing and deemed sysemically important. They worried its problems could ripple through global markets in unexpected and devastating ways.

Regulators watched the stock fall with concern while rivals and clients scanned their books to see what exposure they had to the bank, according to interviews with multiple industry sources and statements from regulators. Some urged their counterparts in Switzerland to act quickly to save the bank.

""The thing that's keeping markets on their toes is we had SVB, then Signature Bank closing down; now it's Credit Suisse,"" said Robert Carnell, ING's head of research for Asia Pacific. ""What next?""

Credit Suisse did not comment for this story but noted recent interviews given by its CEO saying the bank was strong.

As the day progressed on Wednesday, a crisis of confidence enveloped Switzerland's second-biggest bank.

An asset management company in New York was assessing its trading risk, examining what open positions it had with Credit Suisse, said a source at the company.

At a rival bank, an executive reported seeing more Credit Suisse deposits flowing in.

Credit Suisse's bankers were fielding queries from corporate clients who were checking on their liquidity positions with the Swiss bank, two banking sources said.

Large corporate clients had calls and meetings with bankers to assess and understand the evolving situation with the bank and the sector in a so-called ""welfare check"", the sources said.

Staff struggled on through the drama.

""People are nervous, but everyone is still doing their job,"" said one source familiar with the matter.

Not all clients said they were concerned. A corporate treasury executive at a major U.S. firm with hedging business with Credit Suisse reported feeling comfortable with the bank despite what was going on.

A top U.S. bank also kept dealing with Credit Suisse as a counterparty but was carefully managing its exposure, which was small, according to a source.

Bankers were more concerned about contagion or unexpected effects of the Swiss lender's troubles that were not yet understood, one banking source said.

Pressure intensified on the bank. A major European bank held talks with Credit Suisse, urging the lender to seek an urgent central bank liquidity backstop, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.

By late afternoon in New York, there was relief. Swiss regulators had thrown Credit Suisse a financial lifeline.

Markets seemed to calm, but the fresh drama around Credit Suisse jogged memories that the financial system was not out of the woods yet.

""The response was good. It stopped the sort of immediate burning fire, but I don't get the feeling the whole fire is out,"" said one banking lawyer, referring to the Swiss backstop. ""It's smoldering.""

Late on Wednesday, as the trading day swung to Asia, Credit Suisse came out with its own new plan, to ""strengthen its liquidity"" with debt and cash offers.

""We welcome the statement of support,"" Credit Suisse said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this week tried to assuage investor fears about the health of U.S. lenders and the economic ramifications of a potential lending crunch if depositors flee smaller banks, which have outsized roles supporting key sectors such as commercial real estate.

""I don't expect this volatility (in bank stocks) to subside anytime soon,"" said Peter Doherty, head of investment research at private bank Arbuthnot Latham in London.

U.S. regional banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed this month and First Republic Bank shares have lost most of their value.

On Thursday, Yellen pledged further action to safeguard bank deposits, after saying a day earlier that blanket insurance was unlikely. Banks borrowed $110.2 billion at the Federal Reserve's discount window in the latest week, with the hefty drawdown of emergency credit suggesting some lenders were now unable to secure funds elsewhere.

The Fed raised its main interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 4.5%-4.75% on Wednesday, but signalled it would consider a pause in light of banking system stresses.

Markets, however, are betting on a U.S. recession and incoming rate cuts.

Here are the highlights across the sector:

Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick said the bank had $17 million in charge-offs, or debt owed to a bank that is unlikely to be recovered, on its office loan exposure during the second quarter versus $15 million in the first quarter. The value of assets under review for credit risk rose by $1.7 billion from the first quarter, due mainly to its CRE exposure. However, Borthwick noted the bank's office CRE exposure was low relative to its overall loan portfolio, at 2%.

The investment bank reported about $305 million in net losses within a private portfolio, driven by markdowns on office CRE, it said. The Wall Street giant also said its debt investment revenue of $197 million had declined year-on-year due primarily to ""weaker performance"" in its real estate investments.

Goldman Sachs Group CFO Denis Coleman said the bank's provision for credit losses stood at $615 million in the second quarter. CRE loans represented just 15% of the bank's overall lending book, while only 1% of the CRE loan portfolio was office-related.

While its CRE revenue grew to $806 million in the second quarter from $642 million in the first, JPMorgan reported $1.1 billion in credit loss provisions driven by its office portfolio. While the portfolio was ""quite small,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told investors the bank increased provisions ""to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio.""

The bank said it had a $949 million increase in its allowance for credit losses, primarily CRE office loans.

At the same time, it saw a quarter-on-quarter rise in CRE revenue as a result of higher interest rates and loan balances.

""While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio to-date, we are reserving for the weakness that we expect to play out,"" CEO Charlie Scharf said.

Citizens' nonaccrual loans - those on which a payment hasn't been made for 90 days - grew by $195 million to roughly $1.2 billion, while its net charge-offs increased by $19 million to $152 million. Both increases were driven largely by the bank's CRE holdings.

Citizens recorded a credit loss provision of $176 million in the second quarter. It increased its allowance for credit losses to $2.04 billion from $2.01 billion at the end of the first quarter, which included $41 million in connection with its general office portfolio.

""We believe losses are manageable and readily absorbed by reserves,"" Bruce Van Saun, Citizen's CEO, told investors.

The bank highlighted that its CRE portfolio had a low average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 61%, a key metric used to determine the credit risk of a loan. East West's office portfolio had a weighted average LTV of 52%.

While almost three-quarters of the bank's office loans are to borrowers in the troubled California market, it noted a ""high percentage"" of its CRE loans carry full recourse and personal guarantees from individuals with ""substantial net worth.""

""All of these characteristics help to keep this portfolio strong,"" Dominic Ng, East West's chairman and CEO, said.

The regional bank's allowance for credit losses increased 0.09% from the first quarter to $2.53 billion, due in part to a 0.27% increased allowance for its commercial mortgage loans.

Fifth Third's nonperforming CRE loans declined to 0.13% in the second quarter from 0.29% in the first quarter. Its percentage of CRE loans at least 30 days delinquent grew to 0.29% from 0.04%. ""We have limited office exposure,"" Fifth Third CFO James Leonard told investors Thursday, noting the bank ""had deemphasized office even before the pandemic.""

The investment bank said provisions for credit losses in the second quarter amounted to $97 million versus $82 million the same period last year, primarily driven by deterioration in CRE.

The regional bank's nonperforming CRE loans ticked up to $47.9 million last quarter from $35.8 million in the first quarter.

Meanwhile, it divested $80 million in CRE loans last quarter, ""the vast majority of which were secured by office properties,"" resulting in $13 million in charge-offs, Webster CFO Glenn MacInnes told investors. The bank reduced its office exposure by 25% over the last four quarters with a ""minimal hit to capital,"" CEO John Ciulla said.",US Banks Increase Reserves for Real Estate Exposure,non-causal,"LTV, CRE, CFO, CEO","['CFO', 'CRE', 'LTV']","['S', 'U']","['CFO', 'CRE', 'LTV', 'CEO']","['U', 'S', 'CRE', 'LTV', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'FITB']",0.8302263

CEO Jamie Dimon made a bold call on Monday: his firm‚Äôs rescue of First Republic Bank ended the initial phase of the banking crisis.

Twenty-four hours later, that prediction was already looking shaky as Wall Street traders drove down shares of regional banks in a rout that resembled the dark days of March. Several sank more than 10%.

These bank bears can find plenty of ammo in the latest academic research, which casts fresh light on industry stresses in the grip of the biggest monetary-tightening campaign in decades.

It finds that a year of interest-rate hikes have driven unrealized losses for banks to an estimated $1.84 trillion, with trouble in commercial real estate only adding to the pain. Lenders are also facing the risk of deposit flight as frustrated savers leave for higher-yielding alternatives.

So after largely taking it on the chin last week, traders are falling prey to renewed concerns about asset-liability mismatches and uninsured deposits across the banking sector.

‚ÄúAll of a sudden we are raising rates, faster than last time and to a higher level,‚Äù said Philipp Schnabl, a professor at New York University who co-wrote a paper on the bank turmoil. ‚ÄúNow is a question of people waking up ‚Äì are they seeing something on Twitter, reading about it and maybe changing their behavior?‚Äù he said, referring to depositors pulling out their cash.

One major bank index dropped 4.5% Tuesday to the lowest since late 2020, while trading in PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp was halted at one point. Both extended losses in pre-market trading Wednesday following declines of 28% and 15%, respectively, a day earlier. Meanwhile, two- and 10-year yields also dropped further as investors rushed for havens and jobs data pointed to a softening labor market.

Stresses in the banking sector are a headache for Federal Reserve officials meeting this week, as they weigh financial-stability concerns against still stubborn inflation, as shown in data released Friday. While regulators are mulling a broadening of deposit insurance, no changes have yet been announced ‚Äî one reason for the market plunge on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, depositors are waking up to the higher-yielding alternatives outside of bank offerings. Regulatory data show the average US savings rate stands at just about 0.39%, compared with a fed funds rate of nearly 5%.

Until two months ago, the deposit beta ‚Äî which measures how sensitive deposit rates are to changes in the market rate ‚Äî was lower than in previous rate cycles at about 0.2. That meant that banks could pass onto savers just a fifth of the policy-rate move, according to Itamar Drechsler at the University of Pennsylvania and Schnabl and Alexi Savov at NYU. The average during rising-rate periods historically is about 0.4.

That‚Äôs why rate hikes aren‚Äôt entirely bad news for banks. Even as long-term assets slide, they can generate big profits thanks to sticky ‚Äî and cheap ‚Äî deposits. In fact, in the academics‚Äô calculation, based on a deposit beta of 0.2, the increase in value from the deposit franchise has roughly equaled asset losses in this cycle.

But that moat erodes fast when the deposit beta starts rising and if uninsured depositors panic and pull their cash out. And there‚Äôs a growing fear that the era of banking apps means it‚Äôs easier and faster than ever to make withdrawals, raising the chance of a stampede.

‚ÄúIt looks like the deposit beta could rise quite a bit and maybe even double and still only really get back to their historical norm,‚Äù said Savov. ‚ÄúThe question about social media and fintech and so on is about whether they might go beyond that.‚Äù

US bank deposits dropped at the fastest pace on an annual basis since 1981 in the last three months of 2022 and shrank by roughly a similar clip last quarter. While deposit betas may still be historically low, Fed researchers noted they have recently been rising much faster compared with previous rate-hike cycles.

Heightening the risks, banks are now sitting on about $1.84 trillion of unrealized losses after rate hikes pummeled the value of their debt holdings, according to the latest projection from four other economists who earlier wrote a blockbuster paper on the crisis. In research last month, they estimate that a 10% default rate on commercial real estate loans ‚Äì similar to what was seen during the financial crisis ‚Äì would hit banks with another $80 billion of losses, leaving some vulnerable to a run by uninsured depositors.

While that might seem relatively small, it‚Äôs another source of pressure after a year of monetary tightening eroded banks‚Äô capital buffer, wrote Erica Jiang at the University of Southern California, Gregor Matvos at Northwestern University, Tomasz Piskorski at Columbia University and Amit Seru at Stanford University. Exposure to offices has come under scrutiny lately on fears a lasting shift to remote working combined with rate hikes will fuel widespread defaults.

‚ÄúEven if interest rates went to 2.5% and miraculously inflation went down, this issue still lingers,‚Äù Seru said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say we are all out of the woods here.‚Äù

Until Tuesday, markets appeared to be looking beyond banking turmoil. Only five of 38 non-currency assets tracked by Deutsche Bank moved more than 3% in April, the least since the pandemic. By last Friday, a gauge of Treasury volatility had returned to levels seen before SVB‚Äôs demise while the equivalent for the S&P 500, known as the VIX, reached the lowest since late 2021.

Meanwhile, the latest weekly Fed data show an uptick in both bank lending and deposits ‚Äî supporting the view that it‚Äôs not a full-blown crisis yet.

But there are incipient signs of tightening credit conditions. Emergency loans to banks rose last week for a second straight week and a Fed survey reports firms have strengthened lending standards. Bankruptcies are on the rise and banks that reported quarterly results last month said they boosted provisions on bad consumer loans to levels not seen since the early days of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of signs telling us the US banking system is in distress,‚Äù said Piskorski at Columbia. ‚ÄúWe might want to close our eyes and pretend nothing‚Äôs happened, but the signs are already there.‚Äù",Wall Street Is Betting the Regional Bank Crisis Isn‚Äôt Over Yet,non-causal,"US, NYU, VIX, CEO, SVB",['US'],['CEO'],"['VIX', 'SVB', 'CEO', 'NYU', 'US']","['JPM', 'VIX', 'SVB', 'CEO', 'NYU', 'US']",0.6233729

Joseph Gentile joined the now-failed bank in 2007 after leaving his position as the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers' Global Investment Bank.

His departure came just one year before Lehman Brothers, which was then the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States, collapsed ‚Äî leading directly to the Great Recession.

Meanwhile, recently-appointed chief risk officer Kim Olson worked at Deutsche Bank from 2007 through 2010, when it lied to investors about its mortgage-backed securities, the collapse of which led to the housing crisis.

Deutsche Bank was later forced to pay a $7.2 billion penalty.

Silicon Valley Bank fell on Friday after a 60 percent drop in shares, which sparked a run on the bank as panicked customers rushed to withdraw cash.

It was the worst US financial institution failure since 2008, with SVB controlling $209 billion in total assets at the end of 2022. Those are now in the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

But it has now been revealed that some of the very same people who contributed to the stock market crash in 2008 held senior positions at SVB.

Gentile was the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Global Investment Bank, the fourth-largest investment bank at the time, with $649 billion in assets and $613 billion in liabilities.

He left that position to take a job as the chief administrative officer at SVB in 2007.

Just one year later, on September 15, 2008, the bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The bank had branched into mortgage-backed securities and collateral debt obligations in the early 2000s, acquiring five mortgage lenders from 2003 to 2004.

It also bought BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in loans made to borrowers without the full necessary credit.

At first the plan seemed to work, with Lehman Brothers reporting profits every year from 2005 to 2007.

But by the first quarter of 2007, defaults on subprime mortgages began to rise to a seven-year high.

The bank's stocks started to dip, but the firm continued to report record revenues and profits for the first quarter of 2007.

By August 2007, though, the stocks were falling sharply and the company had to eliminate 1,200 mortgage-related jobs and close some of its offices.

Still, the bank continued to underwrite more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders equity.

In the year that followed, Lehman Brothers' stocks plunged even further, and the bank ultimately collapsed ‚Äî leading to a run-on on other banks.

At around the same time, Olson was working at Deutsche Bank, which was forced to pay a $7.2 billion penalty after admitting that it lied to investors about its mortgage-backed securities, the collapse of which led to the housing market crash.

She was a senior risk manager at the firm as the bank made false and misleading representations to investors about the loans underlying billions of dollars worth of mortgage securities.

In May of 2006, before Olson started at the firm, one supervisor was quoted as warning a senior trader that a loan originator would underwrite loans to anyone with 'half a pulse.'

That supervisor would later say that Deutsche Bank, along with several others, 'tolerate misrepresentations' from originators with 'misdirected lending practices' like a borrower's ability to pay, accepting blacked-out pay stubs so they could claim higher incomes.

By May of 2007, the US Department of Justice said, 'Deutsche Bank knew that there was an increasing trend of overvalued properties being sold to Deutsche Bank for securitization.

'As one employee noted, ""We are finding ourselves going back quite often, clearing large numbers of loans [with inflated appraisals] to bring down the deletion percentages.""'

'Deutsche Bank nonetheless purchased and securitized such loans because it received favorable prices on the fraudulent loans,' the DOJ said.

'Ultimately, Deutsche Bank enriched itself by paying reduced prices for risky loans while representing to investors valuation metrics based on appraisals the bank knew to be inflated.'

Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement at the time: 'Deutsche Bank did not merely mislead investors: it contributed to an international financial crisis.'

Still, when Olson came on board SVB in January, CEO Greg Becker touted her experience in a statement.

'Kim‚Äôs deep and multi-faceted financial services experience as a senior risk leader and former regulator and bank supervisor positions her perfectly to actively manage SVB‚Äôs financial and non-financial risks and to build and scale the firm‚Äôs risk management capabilities through our next phase of growth,' he said.

It counted nearly half of the country's venture-capital backed technologies and life sciences companies as clients, and owned 3,234 companies ‚Äî giving the bank the right to buy shares in them.

Its deposits then rose during the COVID pandemic, as more and more people wanted to protect their assets in the bank, with its deposits tripling in just a two-year span to $189billion by 2021, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Executives then decided to invest much of its excess funds in higher-yielding, long term bonds, along with $80billion in 10-year mortgage-backed securities that pay out 1.5percent rather than the short-term Treasury Department securities that pay out only 0.25percent.

That left the bank with a deposit base heavily skewed toward technology firms with huge accounts, over the $250,000 insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

By the end of 2022, a vast majority of the bank's deposits, $157billion, were held in just over 37,000 accounts that were over the FDIC's deposit-insurance gap.

It then continued business as usual, borrowing short-term from depositors and lending long-term without any interest-rates ‚Äî even as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that higher interest rates were coming.

As customers started to ask for their money back as the economy revamped, SVB had to sell $21million worth of its underwater long0term assets with an average interest rate around 1.8percent.

That meant that the bank lost $1.8billion on sales, leaving executives frantically trying to raise more than $2billion to fill the hole before the FDIC took control of the bank on Friday.",CFO at Lehman Brothers worked at SVB. risk manager worked at Deutsche,non-causal,"US, FDIC, BNC, CEO, SVB, DOJ",['DOJ'],"['SVB', 'CFO']","['FDIC', 'DOJ', 'SVB', 'BNC', 'CEO', 'US']","['FDIC', 'DOJ', 'SVB', 'BNC', 'CEO', 'SIVBQ', 'CFO', 'US']",-0.9769091

And many of those municipalities secured three-year contracts for electricity long before the war in Ukraine. Regulated investor-owned electric utilities, primarily Eversource and National Grid, need to buy power on behalf of their basic service customers twice a year in Massachusetts, and set rates accordingly.

Eversource last week unveiled plans to raise its electric supply rates by more than 40 percent as of Jan. 1 in Eastern Massachusetts, reflecting how the costs of producing electricity have skyrocketed in the last year. The main culprit: disruptions in worldwide supplies of natural gas, the most commonly used fuel for power plants in New England, following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Tens of thousands of Eversource customers in Greater Boston can find relief from rising electric rates this winter from an unexpected tactic: going green.

The end result: The green-power aggregation contracts that cities and towns have adopted in the past decade for environmental reasons are now often much cheaper than the basic service through the utilities.

‚ÄúFor a large number of communities, this is benefitting the ratepayer,‚Äù said Geoff Beckwith, head of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.

Most residential customers in Boston were swept into the city‚Äôs municipal aggregation plan nearly two years ago. By default, city officials placed households into its standard plan, which gets 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources this year. (It needs to be 10 percentage points higher than the state mandate of 20 percent for Eversource and National Grid, a figure that rises every year.) Nearly two-thirds of electric customers in Boston, or about 200,000, get their power supplies via the city contract. The rest get Eversource basic service (about 80,000) or buy power from a third-party supplier and could potentially switch into the city‚Äôs plan.

Mayor Michelle Wu‚Äôs administration hopes to persuade more people to make the switch, in light of the upcoming rate hike, and to encourage those in the standard plan to ‚Äútrade up‚Äù to a ‚ÄúGreen 100‚Ä≥ plan for 100 percent renewable power.

The varying rates in Boston offer compelling examples of the potential savings.

Roughly speaking, the lowest-cost plan, with 20 percent renewable power, in the city‚Äôs ‚ÄúCommunity Choice Electricity‚Äù program, costs 10.8 cents per kilowatt hour, for the supply portion of the bills. That‚Äôs compared with 11.2 cents in the city‚Äôs standard plan, and 13.9 cents in ‚ÄúGreen 100.‚Äù Meanwhile, Eversource‚Äôs basic service charge is 17.9 cents for supply, a rate that‚Äôs scheduled to go up to 25.6 cents in January.

What does that mean for a typical house, using 600 kilowatt hours a month? The savings add up quickly: Eversource‚Äôs supply cost goes from $108 to $154 a month in January, for the next six months, while the cost for someone in the Boston plan ranges from $65 a month for the lowest-cost tier to $83 a month for an all-green plan, locked in until the end of 2023.

‚ÄúThere were a lot of times where people think green is going to cost more, but you could have 100 percent renewable energy for less than the 20 percent renewable energy that Eversource has in their supply,‚Äù said Mariama White-Hammond, Boston‚Äôs energy and environmental chief.

White-Hammond notes that consumers with Eversource‚Äôs basic plan can switch back and forth without a penalty, although it could take up to two months before that switch takes effect. She said she believes Boston‚Äôs rates will still likely be lower than Eversource‚Äôs when the utility‚Äôs supply rates change again in July, and when Boston goes out to bid again for a new contract for January of 2024.

‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre going after renewables, and renewables are now significantly cheaper than fossil fuels, we‚Äôre still likely to do better,‚Äù White-Hammond said. ‚ÄúThe worse that fossil fuels do, the more our rates will be competitive.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just Boston. In Newton, for example, the three tiers range from 10.6 cents to 14.4 cents per kilowatt hour ‚Äî or $64 to $86 for the typical home. Newton locked in its rates around the same time Boston did. Somerville, meanwhile, only just established a new three-year contract as of this month. But its rates, ranging from 14.9 cents to 18.6 cents, will all be cheaper than Eversource‚Äôs basic supply service come January.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty funny the way there was angst among some people about whether we can afford renewable energy,‚Äù said Larry Chretien, executive director of Green Energy Consumers Alliance. ‚ÄúThe virtue of aggregation, as I keep saying, is that the city of Boston ... had more flexibility than Eversource did. Eversource has to buy every six months, at a very specific moment.‚Äù

Edgar Dworsky, a Somerville resident who runs the website ConsumerWorld.org, advises consumers who want the best deal to avoid getting stuck with the default service offered by cities and towns and instead to look for the tier with the lowest price.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the middle of high inflation and people‚Äôs budgets are stretched,‚Äù Dworsky said. ‚ÄúCities had different goals. Their goal was to be more green. My goal as a consumer advocate and bargain hunter is to pay the least possible for electricity service. If that‚Äôs your goal, particularly with inflation the way it is now, you‚Äôve got to see what the actual cheapest rate is of the three plans they offer, versus whatever Eversource is offering.‚Äù

SVB COLLAPSE: BIG FED RATE CUTS NOW EXPECTED IN MAJOR REVERSAL OVER RECESSION FEARS

‚ÄúThis week, the government took decisive and forceful actions to strengthen public confidence in our banking system,‚Äù Yellen said. ‚ÄúI can reassure the members of the committee that our banking system remains sound and that Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be there when they need them.‚Äù

After the SVB collapse on Friday, regulators convened to discuss how to shore up the United States banking system. The federal government then announced that it would back all deposits in SVB and Signature Bank, even those in excess of the FDIC‚Äôs $250,000 threshold, in an effort to stop a run on other banks and a hit to the broader economy.

The Fed also rolled out a new source of funding for banks that might face runs by depositors, called the Bank Term Funding Program.

Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) asked Yellen if she agreed that the main issue at play in the SVB collapse was a liquidity risk. She said that there were liquidity issues with SVB but emphasized that there was a run on the bank, which entailed a wave of depositors trying to pull money out to avoid losing it.

‚ÄúThere was a run on the bank, it had high reliance on uninsured deposits, and there was a massive withdrawal of deposits that led to liquidity problems. The bank had to be closed for that reason,‚Äù Yellen responded.

‚ÄúThere will be a careful look at what happened in the bank and what initiated this problem, but clearly, the downfall of the bank ‚Äî the reason it had to be closed ‚Äî was that it couldn‚Äôt meet depositors‚Äô withdrawal requests,‚Äù she added.

Crapo pointed out the bank's assets were losing value because the Federal Reserve has been forced to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace over the past year in an effort to drive down inflation, which made the bank's holdings of Treasury and other loans less valuable. Crapo also said it would have been better to find a private-sector solution to the SVB collapse.

‚ÄúThe solution would have been to get a private-sector solution that protected taxpayers, calmed the markets, and prevented the potential assessments from being inappropriately levied against community banks,‚Äù he said.

Lawmakers also used the hearing to discuss the debt ceiling and the looming battle over raising it. That fight is expected to come to a head early this summer, and Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) emphasized how bad it would be for the economy if the U.S. came even close to defaulting on its obligations.

‚ÄúOne of the most important steps Congress can do now is to make sure there are no questions about the full faith and credit of the United States,‚Äù Wyden said about the prospects of a bruising debt limit fight.

One idea that has been discussed is the idea that the Treasury could attempt to prioritize payments ‚Äî that is, paying some bills while allowing others to go unpaid. Such maneuvers have been contemplated before but have always been rejected as unworkable by the Treasury.

Yellen on Thursday further pushed back on the notion of prioritization.

 Speaking with CNN after the opening of Chase‚Äôs Atlanta branch, Dimon also emphasized he is optimistic about the strength of the economy and American ingenuity.



‚ÄòFull-Throated Capitalist‚Äô

 

 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a red-blooded, full-throated, free-market, free-enterprise capitalist,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúI think we should applaud free enterprise, and we should sing from the hills the benefits while we fix the negatives, as opposed to denigrate the whole thing.‚Äù

 

 The JPMorgan Chase CEO said depositors‚Äô faith in local bank branches, like Chase‚Äôs Atlanta community branch, is imperative to banking and the economy. The newest bank for Chase, the 16th that it has built in partnership with local communities, will hold free personal finance and skills training workshops, and provide storefront space for small business pop-ups.

 

 ‚ÄúWe need to get money into local communities,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people to be afraid to walk into a branch here. Come as you are, bring your kids and learn.‚Äù

 

 Dimon could not predict whether any more banks will fail but emphasized that the upsets this year are nothing like the subprime mortgage credit crisis of 2008 that impacted ‚Äúhundreds of institutions around the world with far too much leverage.‚Äù

 

 He does believe, nonetheless, that it would be alright to permit some banks to collapse: ‚ÄúFailure is OK. You just don‚Äôt want this domino effect.‚Äù

 

 Higher Interest Rates

 

 Dimon said American consumers and regional banks should be prepared for interest rates to remain high, which means that banks holding Treasuries need to manage those investments wisely.

 

 Dimon, who the Biden administration and Congress has called on for his economic insight on various challenges this year, said he will not tolerate the U.S. defaulting on its $31.38 trillion debt limit, which the government reached in January.

 

 There will be no default ‚Äúas long as I‚Äôm alive,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúBoy, we‚Äôre going to keep fighting this one.‚Äù

 

 However, Dimon does not foresee a resolution on the debt ceiling for a few months. As a potential default draws near, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see it in the markets, and that will scare people,‚Äù Dimon warned.

 

 Trump‚Äôs 2024 Campaign

 

 Dimon served on former President Donald Trump‚Äôs business council and believes Trump enacted a number of good economic policies.

 

 Trump‚Äôs ‚Äútax reform brought a trillion dollars back to America,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúThe Black community had the lowest unemployment rate ever in his last year because it grew the economy.‚Äù

 

 Without endorsing Trump for the 2024 election, Dimon said, he feels it is important to point out these major accomplishments and impact on the U.S. economy.

If the U.S. defaults on its debt and is unable to pay all its bills this summer, the pain will fall squarely on the defense industry.

National security is by far the largest category of discretionary federal spending, with budgets rising over the past two years to counter China‚Äôs military expansion and tackle the conflict in Ukraine. Discretionary military spending reached three-quarters of a trillion dollars last year, up from $590 billion five years ago.

House Republicans led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy have demanded across-the-board spending cuts in exchange for raising the limit of the government‚Äôs ability to borrow money, known as the debt ceiling. With a June 1 deadline looming, President Biden and Congressional Democrats maintain that the borrowing limit should be raised without preconditions and have called the GOP stance irresponsible.

Neither side has presented a path forward that could win enough support to pass both chambers of Congress. The brinkmanship has driven investors from defense stocks and prompted efforts inside the Pentagon to mitigate any impact from the broader budget morass.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the legal debt ceiling will prevent further government borrowing as soon as June 1. That could temporarily disrupt federal spending, risking revenue streams for businesses not only in the defense industry, but also in the arenas including healthcare and consulting that bill the Treasury for much of their income.

A Goldman Sachs index of stocks that depend heavily on government revenue‚Äîlargely concentrated in those sectors‚Äîhas lagged behind the market overall, gaining less than 4% this year, compared with 7.8% for the broader S&P 500.

Even if Congress and the president temporarily resolve the crisis by suspending the debt ceiling to leave time for further talks, it would eat into the time Congress needs to write and pass a budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. That would raise the likelihood the Defense Department will have to make do with a temporary budget known as a continuing resolution.

The debt-ceiling standoff has already led the House Armed Services Committee to delay its work on next year‚Äôs defense budget.

‚ÄúThe Republican leadership‚Äôs decision to take the debt ceiling increase hostage, to basically play chicken with the full faith and credit of our country, also cannot do anything but jeopardize our national security,‚Äù said Rep. Adam Smith (D., Wash.), the committee‚Äôs ranking member.

A continuing resolution likely would inflate the costs of military programs, delay the launch of new ones and prevent production increases.

‚ÄúMy biggest strategic worry is that we end up with a year-long CR,‚Äù Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said at a conference this week.

The latest Pentagon budget request includes numerous new program starts, including the Collaborative Combat Aircraft system of uncrewed jets. Boeing and Kratos are among companies developing the aircraft.

Concerns that military spending could be cut‚Äîor, at best delayed‚Äîin a debt-ceiling fight have weighed heavily on investor sentiment toward the biggest military contractors. Shares in Lockheed Martin are down this year more than 7%, with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman off 16% and 20%, respectively.

Rob Stallard, a defense analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said the stocks‚Äô performance reflects a ‚Äúwall of worry‚Äù among investors over the broader budget debate.

The U.S. has never missed a debt payment, and similar debt-ceiling standoffs often have been resolved in 11th-hour legislative agreements. But analysts and investors say that the drama in Washington this spring reflects a deeper political impasse that risks crimping military-spending growth in future budget negotiations.

House Republicans have proposed capping discretionary federal spending at 2022 levels and limiting growth to 1% a year for the next decade. Those limits would apply to discretionary military spending, which‚Äîat $751 billion‚Äîmade up about 44% of the government‚Äôs discretionary spending last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While Republicans are seeking a spending freeze, many members have voiced support for a larger increase in the military budget, though it would come at the cost of cuts in other areas.

While defense-company executives have been loath to quantify the impact of a disrupted budget, some have tried to position themselves as more protected than others.

KBR, a company that provides logistical support for the military overseas and for the U.S. space program, thinks services in those areas are so critical that the government can‚Äôt cut back on contracts, Chief Executive Stuart Bradie said.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing in space can‚Äôt be turned off,‚Äù he said.

Spending by the Pentagon and other agencies with national security missions tends to be uneven, with large contract awards skewing spending in any given month. That pattern often leaves them unaligned with the flow of tax revenue into the Treasury, requiring borrowing to close the gap.

The prospect of a disruption in federal spending during the summer months is particularly concerning. Contract awards tend to surge in the run up to the end of the government‚Äôs fiscal-year end on Sept. 30, said executives and analysts.

‚ÄúIf Treasury has to start paying obligations without additional borrowing, June to August is not an ideal period to begin that experiment,‚Äù said Byron Callan at Capital Alpha Partners, which provides policy research.

Meanwhile, concerns that the flow of military contracts could be interrupted might have sped up deals before any potential spending freeze.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some programs that have been in the acquisition process for years, and they‚Äôre starting to get awarded,‚Äù Roger Krone, who recently retired as CEO of Leidos, told analysts at an investor event last week. Leidos, whose government contracts span healthcare, civil aviation and defense, earned nearly 86% of its revenue from federal agencies last year.

Fifteen years later, Credit Suisse Group AG found itself on a similar precipice. The Swiss lender, weakened by a series of scandals, had seen its already-low share price fall even further after the failure in recent days of two U.S. banks, SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O).

So, when Saudi National Bank (1180.SE) Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy said his bank, the largest investor in Credit Suisse, could not give it more money, investors ran for the exits.

It didn't matter that Saudi National Bank also gave a reason - further investment would leave it with more than 10% of Credit Suisse's shares, a regulatory hurdle - and that it said it was happy with the Swiss bank's turnaround plan.

Nor did it matter that Credit Suisse Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner had been out over the past few days trying to reassure investors that the bank was strong, with enough capital and liquidity.

By the time traders in New York were switching on screens on Wednesday, Credit Suisse had lost more than a fifth of its value. Its five-year credit default swaps, an indicator of credit stress, spiked to a new record high.

The Swiss lender, investors saw, was not only much bigger than the regional U.S. banks that had failed in the past few days, but it was also an important cog in global financial plumbing and deemed sysemically important. They worried its problems could ripple through global markets in unexpected and devastating ways.

Regulators watched the stock fall with concern while rivals and clients scanned their books to see what exposure they had to the bank, according to interviews with multiple industry sources and statements from regulators. Some urged their counterparts in Switzerland to act quickly to save the bank.

""The thing that's keeping markets on their toes is we had SVB, then Signature Bank closing down; now it's Credit Suisse,"" said Robert Carnell, ING's head of research for Asia Pacific. ""What next?""

Credit Suisse did not comment for this story but noted recent interviews given by its CEO saying the bank was strong.

As the day progressed on Wednesday, a crisis of confidence enveloped Switzerland's second-biggest bank.

An asset management company in New York was assessing its trading risk, examining what open positions it had with Credit Suisse, said a source at the company.

At a rival bank, an executive reported seeing more Credit Suisse deposits flowing in.

Credit Suisse's bankers were fielding queries from corporate clients who were checking on their liquidity positions with the Swiss bank, two banking sources said.

Large corporate clients had calls and meetings with bankers to assess and understand the evolving situation with the bank and the sector in a so-called ""welfare check"", the sources said.

Staff struggled on through the drama.

""People are nervous, but everyone is still doing their job,"" said one source familiar with the matter.

Not all clients said they were concerned. A corporate treasury executive at a major U.S. firm with hedging business with Credit Suisse reported feeling comfortable with the bank despite what was going on.

A top U.S. bank also kept dealing with Credit Suisse as a counterparty but was carefully managing its exposure, which was small, according to a source.

Bankers were more concerned about contagion or unexpected effects of the Swiss lender's troubles that were not yet understood, one banking source said.

Pressure intensified on the bank. A major European bank held talks with Credit Suisse, urging the lender to seek an urgent central bank liquidity backstop, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.

By late afternoon in New York, there was relief. Swiss regulators had thrown Credit Suisse a financial lifeline.

Markets seemed to calm, but the fresh drama around Credit Suisse jogged memories that the financial system was not out of the woods yet.

""The response was good. It stopped the sort of immediate burning fire, but I don't get the feeling the whole fire is out,"" said one banking lawyer, referring to the Swiss backstop. ""It's smoldering.""

Late on Wednesday, as the trading day swung to Asia, Credit Suisse came out with its own new plan, to ""strengthen its liquidity"" with debt and cash offers.

""We welcome the statement of support,"" Credit Suisse said.

            Following the collapse of First Republic last week, the meltdown of three other banks, and the Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase, making the tenth straight hike in an aggressive campaign to tame elevated inflation, a professor of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business presented a grim warning that the regional banking dominos are falling. 

In a New York Times opinion piece titled ""Yes, You Should Be Worried About a Potential Bank Crisis. Here's Why,"" Professor Amit Seru wrote, ""the fragility and collapse of several high-profile banks are most likely not an isolated phenomenon."" He said, ""A damaging combination of fast-rising interest rates, major changes in work patterns, and the potential of a recession could prompt a credit crunch not seen since the 2008 financial crisis."" 


Just in the past few months, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank have failed. Their combined assets surpassed those held by the 25 banks (when adjusted for inflation) that collapsed at the height of the financial crisis. While some experts and policymakers believe that the resolution of First Republic Bank on Monday indicates the turbulence in the industry is coming to an end, I believe this may be premature. On Thursday, shares of PacWest and Western Alliance are falling as investors' fears spread. Adverse conditions have significantly weakened the ability of many banks to withstand another credit shock ‚Äî and it's clear that a big one may already be on its way.

Rapidly rising interest rates create perilous conditions for banks because of a basic principle: The longer the duration of an investment, the more sensitive it is to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the assets that banks hold to generate a return on their investment fall in value. And because the banks' liabilities ‚Äî like its deposits, which customers can withdraw at any time ‚Äî usually are shorter in duration, they fall by less. Thus, increases in interest rates can deplete a bank's equity and risk leaving it with more liabilities than assets. So it's no surprise that the US banking system's market value of assets is around $2 trillion lower than suggested by their book value. When the entire set of approximately 4,800 banks in the United States is examined, the decline in the value of equity is most prominent for midsize and smaller banks, reflecting their heavier bets on long-term assets.


In an interview with The Guardian, Seru was more precise about just how many banks were burning through their capital buffers and were underwater. The estimate is shocking: Almost half of America's 4,800 banks.


""It's spooky. Thousands of banks are underwater.

""Let's not pretend that this is just about Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. A lot of the US banking system is potentially insolvent.""


Since monetary tightening works in long lags (9-12 months), many of the rate hikes over the last year have yet to filter through the real economy. In the coming quarters, the US banking system will face its toughest challenge yet, as tightening lending standards might spark more breaking. 

In Seru's NYTimes op-ed piece, he noted, ""There's another looming area of concern that could spark such panic: The commercial real estate sector."" 


Commercial real estate loans, worth $2.7 trillion in the United States, make up around a quarter of an average bank's assets. Many of these loans are coming due in the next few years, and refinancing them at higher rates naturally increases the risk of default. Rising interest rates also depress the value of commercial properties, especially those with long-term leases and limited rent escalation clauses, which also increases the likelihood of owner default. In the Great Recession, for example, default rates rose to about 9 percent, up from around 1 percent, as interest rates rose.


For Zerohedge readers, the dual crises affecting regional banks and the commercial real estate sector (offices) isn't a new thesis. We first proposed the coming turmoil on Mar. 21 in a note titled """"Nowhere To Hide In CMBS"": CRE Nuke Goes Off With Small Banks Accounting For 70% Of Commercial Real Estate Loans"".

The widely-followed survey is the latest sign of how challenges in the banking industry could pose a threat to US economic growth.

In fact, the Fed in a separate report released Monday highlighted a broader contraction in credit as a near-term risk to the financial system.

""A sharp contraction in the availability of credit would drive up the cost of funding for businesses and households, potentially resulting in a slowdown in economic activity,"" it said in its semi-annual Financial Stability Report.

Banks had been tightening standards before turmoil of the first quarter, which resulted in the failure of three sizable lenders and outflows of hundreds of billions in deposits. This new survey of senior loan officers confirms the squeeze on credit availability persisted ‚Äî and is expected to linger for much of the year.

Bank officers also told the Fed that demand for new loans weakened in the first quarter, particularly for commercial and residential real estate, commercial and industrial and auto lending. The demand was weakest for commercial loans since 2009.

""The effects of the banking panic will be felt over time,"" according to a note from analysts at Oxford Economics. ""Large proportions of banks of all sizes plan to tighten standards further over the rest of the year.""

Bank officers surveyed by the Fed cited a variety of reasons for the tightening they expect to last through 2023, including deteriorating credit quality of their loan portfolios and collateral values, a reduction of risk tolerance, deposits outflows and concerns about bank funding and liquidity.

Deposit balances at U.S. commercial banks have fallen by $521 billion between the beginning of March and the third week of April, according to Fed data. Silicon Valley Bank lost more than $40 billion in deposits in one day before it was seized by regulator. Another failed bank, First Republic, lost more than $100 billion in March.

Commercial loans and leases continue to rise at all banks, according to Fed data, although at a slowing pace.

‚ÄúLending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year,‚Äù Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs said last week shortly after the U.S. central bank announced another rate hike.

The worries about a credit crunch are become a hot topic across many companies. The use of the phrase ‚Äútighter lending‚Äù tripled during first-quarter earnings calls with analysts, according to an analysis from Bank of America.

Firms in the financial and real estate sectors mentioned the phrase the most. ‚ÄúIf credit conditions tighten further, a deceleration in sales is likely,‚Äù the analysts said.

One sector under close scrutiny is commercial real estate, which relies heavily on US banks for funding. The fear is if borrowers are forced to refinance office towers or shopping centers at higher rates, it could cause a wave of defaults across the US.

The Federal Reserve warned Monday in its Financial Stability Report that a material decrease in commercial property prices could lead to credit losses for banks with sizable exposure to commercial real estate.

Banks hold about 60% of commercial real estate loans, according to the Fed. ‚ÄúThe magnitude of a correction in property values could be sizable,‚Äù the Fed‚Äôs report read.

In the wake of three bank failures, rising interest rates, and a contraction of credit among lenders, clearly there are additional challenges in today‚Äôs market. In early 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, followed closely by the falling out of Signature Bank and then First Republic Bank, as reported in the Financial Times. In May, the Federal Reserve announced increased rates from 5% to 5.25% in an effort to tame inflation and spur job growth.

That said, debt typically takes up a portion of the capital stack and is often necessary to acquire a property. Once you‚Äôve found a great opportunity, you‚Äôll usually gather two main types of equity, known as preferred equity and common equity (I explained how these work in a previous article). The capital stack also includes layers of debt, which we‚Äôll look at in depth here. These are senior debt and mezzanine debt, and it‚Äôs important to both understand what they are and how today‚Äôs lending environment could impact your financing activity.

Banks and lending institutions issue this type of debt, which is secured by a mortgage, or a pledge of the property. Senior debt could also be available from insurance companies and CMBS markets. (CMBS stands for commercial mortgage-backed security.) If payments are not made, the lender typically retains the right to take over the place through foreclosure. They can then resell the property to recoup their expected return.

Senior debt takes the bottom of the capital stack, as it has the lowest risk. Lenders will be paid first, before mezzanine debt holders and equity investors. Senior debt also has the lowest opportunity for rewards, as the interest rate will be established and is typically lower than what mezzanine and equity participants will receive.

In the capital stack, mezzanine debt falls into place in the middle, below common and preferred equity, and above senior debt. It is a hybrid lending tool that serves as a bridge between the debt and equity portions. It acts as a secondary loan against the ownership of the property. This type of financing could come from sources such as a family office or another privately negotiated transaction. Mezzanine debt lenders generally expect to receive regular payments at an interest rate that is higher than the senior debt rate. They usually hold the right to convert the debt into an equity interest if the borrower defaults on the loan.

In terms of payments, the mezzanine debt is serviced after the operating expenses and senior debt. For this reason, it carries higher risk in the capital stack than senior debt. However, it also has priority over preferred equity and common equity. As such, it is generally considered safer than preferred equity and common equity. It also has less potential for rewards than the equity portions of the capital stack.

During the past year, banks have been tightening their lending policies for all categories of commercial real estate loans, per the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey released by the Federal Reserve in April 2023. The most frequent changes included greater spreads of loan rates over banks‚Äô cost of funds, along with a drop in loan-to-value ratios. (Loan-to-value refers to the loan amount divided by the total value of the property).

That said, U.S. banking officials are recognizing these trends and addressing the stresses of the market. In June, top regulators asked lenders to work with commercial real estate owners who are facing such a difficult environment, as reported in Bisnow. Borrowers with good credit standing may be able to make agreements on loan repayments to accommodate their situations.

Given these trends, investors today can expect the need to bring more equity to the table when acquiring properties. The types of financing available may carry more risk as well.

Shareholders and unsecured debtholders will not be protected, and senior management has been removed. At more than $110 billion in assets, Signature Bank is the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The second-largest such failure came Friday from Santa Clara-based Silicon Valley Bank. Signature Bank is among the main banks for the cryptocurrency industry, according to CNBC.

The bank's closure was announced in a statement from Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Martin Gruenberg. Yellen has cleared the FDIC to resolve both Silicon Valley and Signature banks. Depositors at the banks, including those whose holdings exceed the $250,000 insurance limit, will be able to access their money Monday.

Additionally, the Fed announced Sunday it would make funding available to ensure America's banks could serve their depositors. ‚ÄúThe U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúThose reforms combined with today‚Äôs actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors‚Äô savings remain safe.‚Äù

Regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution with more than $200 billion in assets, when it experienced a traditional bank run, with depositors rushing to withdraw their funds all at once. The only larger bank failure in U.S. history is the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual. Silicon Valley Bank had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals. Yellen described rising interest rates, which have been increased by the Fed to combat inflation, as the core problem for the bank.

The Treasury has set aside $25 billion to offset any losses incurred under the Fed's emergency lending facility. Fed officials said, however, that they do not expect to have to use any of that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default. Though Sunday's steps marked the most extensive government intervention in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis, its actions are relatively limited compared with what was done 15 years ago.

With the looming due date of temporary bridge funding from Silicon Valley Bank, startups are now in a mad dash to figure out how they will cover and refinance their obligations, according to an official at one of Canada's government-owned venture capital firms.

            Authored by Michael Msika, Bloomberg,

The turmoil around Credit Suisse is gripping traders‚Äô attention just days after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. For investors holding bank shares, today‚Äôs European Central Bank meeting will be a test case for whether monetary authorities hold the line with interest rate hikes, even in the face of financial sector stress.

The Credit Suisse crisis and Wednesday‚Äôs rout across European bank shares mean the ECB can‚Äôt dismiss the downfall of SVB and two other US lenders as a transatlantic problem. The Swiss lender‚Äôs problems are long standing, but there is no denying that bond market volatility, relentless rate rises and the threat of economic recession can lead to severe financial sector stress.

Authorities will have watched with alarm as the Stoxx 600 Banks Index, Europe‚Äôs best-performing sector at the start of March, erased most of its year-to-date gains in the space of a few days.

Credit Default Swaps, a barometer of risk, are on the rise.

The question for the ECB is whether the shakeout is merely that ‚Äî a shakeout ‚Äî or a sign of real trouble.

BNP Paribas strategist Ankit Gheedia describes the selloff as a sort of ‚Äúcapitulation moment‚Äù for European banks, exacerbated by crowded long positions in the sector.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early to say if the bull case for banks is behind us or not, but clearly price action is concerning, and seeming like it would need some external support from regulators,‚Äù Gheedia adds. 


Positioning was indeed very extended. JPMorgan European derivatives strategist Davide Silvestrini points out that net long positions in Euro Stoxx banks‚Äô futures surpassed ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.2 billion) before this week‚Äôs selloff, near the highest since the Ukraine war erupted a year ago. Bullish option trades had also accumulated, hence the ‚Äúoverreaction,‚Äù Silvestrini says.



Many reckon that with euro area inflation running at 8.5%, the ECB will look through the turmoil and deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike.

After all, its chief Christine Lagarde recently described inflation as a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù that must be slain, a view reinforced by this week‚Äôs above-forecast US price data.

The US print showed further rate hikes are needed, but this risks more financial stability stress, says Evgenia Molotova, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management.


‚ÄúHence we might end up with either recession, if the rate hikes continue, or entrenched inflation if they don‚Äôt. It is very relevant for Europe as well as US.‚Äù




One crucial point though, is that the surge in credit default swaps on Credit Suisse has not triggered panic about other large banks, though their CDS too have risen. European bank shares trade at cheap valuations and are seen as more tightly regulated than US peers. The heightened scrutiny of banks for balance-sheet mismatches is also a positive, investors say.


‚ÄúWe remain bullish on European banks, the investment case on fast growing net interest margins is still intact,‚Äù said Fabio Caldato, a partner at Olympia Wealth Management, who is keen to invest in the sector. 

‚ÄúRegulations matter and European rules are luckily conservative.‚Äù


However, recession worries are already driving investors out of growth-sensitive cyclical shares such as autos, banks and retailers, a possibility this column had flagged at the end of February. Instead, defensive sectors such as food and pharma are back in favor.

John Leiper, CIO at Titan Asset Management, is among those taking a defensive stance. ‚ÄúWe are now starting to see the impact of prior tightening starting to bite,‚Äù Leiper says. ‚ÄúWe remain concerned that these ripple effects will continue to spread across the economy.‚Äù

Brookfield, the largest office owner in downtown Los Angeles, that month chose to default on loans on two buildings rather than refinance the debt due to weak demand for office space.

They are a bellwether for what is likely to come, as more than half of the $2.9 trillion in commercial mortgages will be up for refinancing in the next couple of years, according to Morgan Stanley.

‚ÄúEven if current rates stay where they are, new lending rates are likely to be 3.5 to 4.5 percentage points higher than they are for many of CRE‚Äôs existing mortgages,‚Äù wrote Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett, in a recent report.

Empty offices:For vacant office buildings, research labs may offer a new lease on life during COVID

Even before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, the commercial real estate market was dealing with a host of challenges including dwindling demand for office space brought on remote work, increased maintenance costs and climbing interest rates.

With small- and medium-size banks accounting for 80% of commercial real estate lending, the situation might soon get worse, says experts.

Commercial property prices could fall as much as 40% ‚Äúrivaling the decline during the 2008 financial crisis,‚Äù forecast Morgan Stanley analysts.

‚ÄúThese kinds of challenges can hurt not only the real estate industry, but also entire business communities related to it,‚Äù says Shalett.

Is all commercial real estate in trouble?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wide bucket of assets,‚Äù says Mark Grinis, EY Americas Real Estate, Hospitality & Construction leader. ‚ÄúIf you go to our data centers or in our industrial buildings that are powering e-commerce, they're doing quite well. If you go into the multi-family business, rents maybe softening a little bit, but there's still an undersupply of housing. The elephant in the room is office space, that‚Äôs going through a transformative shift.‚Äù

When it comes to office loans, since 2021, 44% more by volume were in delinquency and 55% more were in special servicing, according to Trepp, a provider of data and insights on commercial real estate.

Private equity to the rescue of office buildings?

In the short term, poorly structured, capitalized and financed buildings are probably either undergo some sort of change of ownership or go through foreclosure, says Grinis.

‚ÄúYou're gonna see some eggs broken as these things (mortgages) mature and come due,‚Äù says Grinis. ‚ÄúAnd they either have to find somebody that'll give them additional equity capital, they have to get their lender to be flexible or it will go back to the bank.‚Äù

When the price is right, expect private capital to step in.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a publicly traded security and a lot of people are looking at some of these office stocks and saying, ‚ÄòGod, these are a pretty good buy,‚Äù so private equity will, at some point when the price is right, be there.‚Äù

Kip Sowden, CEO of Dallas-based RREAF Holdings, a private real estate investment firm with $5 billion in assets under management, says he‚Äôs seen business shrink due to tighter lending requirements.

The company, which operates in 14 states, develops multi-family dwellings, beachfront resorts, large residential communities, extended stay hotels and is in the process of developing RV parks.

In 2022, the company exceeded $1.5 billion in deal volume, up from $1.3 billion in 2021, he said.

‚ÄúAnd in 2023, we think those numbers will likely be cut in half because of higher interest rates and just contraction in the number of deals financial institutions will look to fund.‚Äù

Sowden, who borrows from regional banks, says underwriting requirements have become very stringent.

‚Äú A lot more equity is necessary to transact than before,‚Äù he said.

Office ‚Äìto‚Äìresidential conversions have been a hot topic of discussion ever since the pandemic emptied out office buildings.

State and local officials can help developers stuck with languishing properties while addressing affordable housing challenges in cities by fast-tracking zoning changes required for these conversions, say experts.

‚ÄúCities like New York and San Francisco are jewels of urban landscape and nobody benefits when these urban centers suffer,‚Äù says Grinis. ""And so, there's a call to action with respect to governments, private capital and then to maybe to some extent, regulators and legislators to ensure that the vibrancy of cities continue.‚Äù

This makes India the third largest civil aviation market after China and the United States and one of the fastest growing ones. A Barclays report released in June shows that Indian carriers account for nearly 7% of the industry backlog of orders, the second largest in the world after the U.S. In such a rapidly growing market, the presence of two large and established players could lead to price increases in the future. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãIndia does look to move towards just two main players in the aviation space in future.

As IndiGo and Air India group airlines consolidated their presence in the market, their competition either folded or found themselves in legal trouble and lost consumer confidence. Since 2010, two full service carriers have ceased operations in India. Kingfisher Airlines shut in 2012 after it could not pay its outstanding dues to aircraft lessors, oil companies, airports and salaries to its staff. Jet Airways met with the same fate in 2019 due to similar reasons. The latest casualty is low-cost carrier Go First. It filed for voluntary insolvency in May and its bankruptcy filing showed that it owes $798 million to its financial creditors although the company said that it had not defaulted on any of its dues. The airline had a market share of 6.4% in April, the month before it stopped flying, which fell to 0.4% in May. After being grounded for nearly three months, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on July 21 that the airline could resume operations provided it met certain conditions. As of publication of this piece, it had canceled all its flights until July 25. The last long-standing competitor SpiceJet is not without its problems. Its market share decreased to 4.4% in June 2023 from 13.4% in January 2019. Its financials have not been too rosy either as it has posted a loss in eight of its last 10 quarters, and its share price has fallen by 18% in 2023. Currently, its share trading has been suspended. It also faces insolvency pleas from lessors.

Akasa - the new airline on the block Budget carrier Akasa Air started commercial operations in August last year. In a short span of 10 months, its market share has grown to 4.8% from 0.2%. Presently it is scheduled to operate to and from 20 destinations in India until October.

As we detailed earlier, Credit Suisse Group AG's shares reached their lowest point ever, dropping by as much as 10%. This is the eighth consecutive session of decline, which comes in the wake of restructuring issues, delays in submitting its annual report due to 'material weakness' flagged by the SEC last week, and a broader industry selloff following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In addition to these challenges, the troubled Swiss bank now faces a new problem: its top shareholder has said they will not invest any further due to the sharp decline in valuations.

""The answer is absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory,"" Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Wednesday.

That was in response to a question about whether Credit Suisse would receive fresh injections if another liquidity crisis emerged. 

Saudi National Bank, which is 37% owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, is Credit Suisse's largest shareholder as of late 2022 after acquiring a 9.9% stake. Al Khudairy said there are no plans at the moment to take the stake over the 10% threshold because of regulatory hurdles. In the last several months, since the bank's equity has been on a waterfall lower, the Saudis have lost more than 500 million francs on their position. 

The news the Saudis are perhaps done supporting the troubled Swiss bank sent shares down as much as 25% to a new record low in Zurich. 



Putting that new record low in context... down over 98% from the 2000 highs. The red area is post-Greensill debacle...



Bear in mind that CD remains a SIFI, prompting systemic risk fears and has led to the cost of insuring the bank's bonds against default in the near term to distressed levels. 


""One-year credit default swaps for the embattled Swiss lender were indicated at 835.9 basis points on Tuesday's close of business, based on pricing source CMAQ. Other pricing sources point to a further rise on Wednesday, while a level of 1,000 would indicate serious concern,"" Bloomberg said. 




Five-year credit default swaps have widened the most ever -- indicating the restructuring of the bank and the hope to bring it back to profitability might be unattainable at the moment as a banking crisis triggered by SVB sparks contagion. 



Also today, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann stated the bank isn't considering government aid and that it would be inaccurate to draw parallels between its current difficulties and the collapse of SVB. 


""We have strong capital ratios, a strong balance sheet,"" Lehmann said. 

""We already took the medicine,"" he said, referring to the restructuring program announced in late 2022. 


Barclays told clients this morning that the outlook for European banks remains uncertain in the short term, citing ""too-difficult-to-predict"" risks and the restrictive pathway of monetary policy.

Shares of First Republic Bank, which suffered a 36% drop Thursday morning before rebounding following the announcement of a $30 billion rescue plan from the country‚Äôs biggest banks, have once again fallen, dropping more than 25% Friday, to $25.64. Western Alliance shares have also plummeted Friday morning, down nearly 18% to $30.36‚Äîits lowest since March 2020. Shares of Truist Financial Corp, one of the country‚Äôs largest regional banks, fell nearly 6% Friday morning to $30.95‚Äîits lowest since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Comerica shares have dropped more than 7% on the day so far, hitting a 30-month low of $44.05, while East West Bancorp shares are down nearly 8% Friday morning to a 28-month low of $53.78 and KeyCorp stocks are down more than 8% to $11.24.

Economists‚Äô fears of widespread banking turmoil began to mount last week, when California-based Silicon Valley Bank abruptly collapsed. The bank, which catered to tech companies like Roku and Circle, had announced two days earlier it lost nearly $2 billion in the sale of $21 billion in securities as it attempted to grab cash‚Äîafter its depositors withdrew massive amounts of money following multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced plans on Sunday to make all of the bank‚Äôs depositors whole, even if they had deposited more than the FDIC‚Äôs guaranteed threshold of $250,000. That same day, New York‚Äôs state regulator announced it had taken possession of Signature Bank, after customers withdrew their deposits in a bank run, and as its shares plummeted nearly 25% to $70 Friday in the bank‚Äôs worst day ever on Wall Street. The collapse sparked fears among economists that more regional banks could be in trouble, causing regional banks‚Äô stocks to fall throughout the week, while the country‚Äôs 10 biggest banks lost more than $185 billion in market value between last Wednesday and Monday. Fearing continued losses, 11 of the country‚Äôs biggest banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo‚Äîpledged Thursday to provide $5 billion each in uninsured deposits to First Republic, writing in a statement: ‚ÄúRegional, midsize and small banks are critical to the health and functioning of our financial system.‚Äù

Some investors, however, harshly criticized the $30 billion rescue plan for First Republic, arguing it instills a ‚Äúfalse sense of confidence‚Äù in the market and deepens the risk of contagion. In a scathing tweet, billionaire Bill Ackman, the head of major hedge fund Pershing Square, argued the banks would risk spreading First Republic‚Äôs ‚Äúdefault risk‚Äù to bigger banks by providing uninsured deposits, saying he is ‚Äúextremely concerned‚Äù about contagion ‚Äúspiraling out of control and causing severe economic damage.‚Äù In a joint statement, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called the massive cash infusion a ‚Äúmost welcome‚Äù show of support.

First Republic‚Äôs stocks had bounced back Thursday afternoon after banks proposed the $30 billion rescue plan, climbing 10% by market close to $34.35. The California bank‚Äôs stocks had plummeted nearly 36% Thursday morning to $19.80, following reports company officials were considering a sale and after the bank received two credit downgrades.

In response to the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank‚Äîthe second- and third-largest in U.S. history‚ÄîSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) proposed a bill Wednesday seeking to reintroduce regulations on small and medium-sized banks initially implemented in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in response to the 2008 Great Recession. But the bill, which would create restrictions including regular stress tests that had been eliminated in 2018, faces steep opposition from Congressional Republicans, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who argued increased regulation wouldn‚Äôt prevent banks from relying on the federal government to ‚Äúswoop in after taking excessive risks.‚Äù

What To Watch For

The Federal Reserve will have an opportunity to raise interest rates when it meets again next Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell had told the Senate Banking Committee last week, before the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank, that the central bank could introduce a ‚Äúhigher‚Äù interest rate hike, though analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the recent developments in the banking system could persuade the Fed against raising rates.
