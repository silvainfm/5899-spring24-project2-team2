1,good,True,positive,28164,"CFOs Boost Currency Protections, Extend Hedge Contracts as Strong Dollar Takes Toll. 

The dollar in recent quarters has surged against major international currencies as the Federal Reserve‚Äö√Ñ√¥s rate increases outpace those of other central banks, making higher-yielding dollar assets more attractive for investors. Changes to companies‚Äö√Ñ√¥ hedge contracts include covering larger amounts of earnings as well as longer durations beyond the usual 18 to 24 months. 

Midland, Mich.-based Dow recorded a significant jump in foreign currency contracts as well, from $5.3 billion at the end of December to $13.13 billion at the end of the third quarter.","Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark and Prologis are among the U.S. businesses that have added protection or lengthened hedges",KO,Food & Beverage,Non-Alcoholic Beverages,Coca-Cola Co,2023-05-04T23:39:33+00:00,2023-05-04,2023-05-04T23:39:33+00:00,[{'name': 'Tech'}],"Apple (AAPL) posted a better-than-expected March quarter after the bell Thursday, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty ‚Äî helping the market clear another one of the big four hurdles we laid out earlier this week. Shares gained more than 2% in after-hours trading. Revenue in Apple's fiscal second quarter of $94.84 billion dropped 3% year-over-year but beat expectations of $92.96 billion. Foreign exchange fluctuations were a headwind of over 500 basis points or more than 5 percentage points. Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52 were flat compared to a year ago, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.43. Gross margin was 44.3%, expanding from a year ago and edging the 44.1% consensus estimate. Bottom line Apple bounced back nicely from the supply-constrained December quarter to deliver record March quarter results across a few key categories and metrics. The installed base of active devices continued to expand to more than 2 billion. New services and features are constantly being added ‚Äî including a recent buy now, pay later option and high-yield savings accounts ‚Äî providing fuel to an incredible ecosystem that garners unmatched loyalty and satisfaction from its customers. Wednesday evening's disappointing outlook on handset chipsets from Qualcomm (QCOM) sparked fears that global demand for mobile devices had been slipping even further. However, the Q2 results and outlook commentary a day later from Apple should ease some of those concerns, at least for now. ( We exited the Club's remaining small position in Qualcomm Thursday morning.) It's hard to tell if Apple's results were enough to send shares in the near term back to all-time highs of about $176 each, set back in August. But for now, we do know that two of the four market events we were concerned about have passed ‚Äî the Fed's latest interest rate hike and Apple's earnings. We reiterate that Apple should be owned, and not traded. The next question market for the market is Friday's employment report, followed by the June deadline on the debt ceiling. Cash flow Apple updated its generous shareholder return program Thursday evening. The board, as expected, authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion worth of stock and raised the quarterly dividend by a penny to 24 cents per share, marking the eleventh straight year of increases. Apple has a policy of being so-called net cash neutral over time, meaning that if the cash isn't used for acquisitions or organic growth investments, it's returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In its March quarter, Apple returned $23 billion via the repurchase of 129 million shares valued at $19.1 billion and $3.7 billion in dividends. Quarterly commentary It was another quarter of records for Apple. Sales of iPhones and Services as well as the installed base of active devices for all major product categories and geographic segments all grew to all-time highs. Driving the new March quarter iPhone record were sales of the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, which people love for the long battery life and advanced camera. The Pro was called out as well. Mac results, though down 31% year over year, were in line with management expectations as the business faces difficult compares after last year's M1 chip rollout. But really, this is no different than what we are seeing in the personal computer industry. The iPad's revenue decline of nearly 13% was also in line with expectations. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was flat but posted a solid beat. Services, a high-margin business for Apple, reached a new all-time revenue record in March with records across the App Stores, Apple Music, iCloud, and payment services units. Services rose 5.5% from last year but just missed estimates. Apple now has more than 975 million paid subscriptions, up 150 million in the last 12 months, underscoring what Apple does best in terms of selling a quality smartphone or computing and attaching so many different valuable subscription services. By geography, a few things stick out to us. Americas was a surprise miss, with revenues falling 7.6% from last year. We can trace back one reason for the annual decline to the United States, where last year many U.S. carriers were aggressive with their promotional activity. As for the big beat and 2.8% gain in Europe, keep in mind that Apple lumps in sales from India into this bucket. Sales in India grew double digits year over year to a new quarterly record. Apple opened up two new stores there just a few weeks ago, and they're off to a great start, according to the company. India represents one of Apple's next big growth markets. But the company is also doing quite well with record quarterly results in many other emerging markets. Finally, it was notable to see Greater China post such a solid beat given some of the recent uncertainty surrounding consumer buying patterns following the reopening. One reason that might explain Apple's strength is market share gains, which CEO Tim Cook believed the iPhone achieved in the quarter. China sales, despite the beat, fell nearly 3% year over year. Guidance As has been the case since the start of the Covid pandemic, Apple refrained from providing specific revenue guidance. Instead, what management offers is more directional commentary. For the current June quarter, Apple expects year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter result, assuming no worsening macro outlook. Foreign exchange will still be a headwind but improving sequentially, with the team estimating a negative year-over-year impact of nearly 4 percentage points. Services revenue growth is expected to be similar to the March quarter with management calling out headwinds impacting areas like digital advertising and mobile gaming. Gross margins look like they have some upside, with management guiding to between 44% and 44.5% versus estimates of 43.82%. One trend working in Apple's favor is favorable component pricing, like in memory. Putting it all together, these comments appear to be more or less in line with expectations, with the market likely putting more emphasis on the margin upside than the possible annual decline in revenues.

Six months ago Tesla (TSLA) shares were flying high. The company was valued at $1.1 trillion ‚Äî more than a dozen other top automakers combined ‚Äî and announcing plans for a proposed stock split.

Then Musk disclosed he had become the largest investor in Twitter (TWTR), followed shortly by an announcement of his plans to buy control of the social media company.

Things haven‚Äôt been the same for Tesla shares since.

And although Musk‚Äôs efforts to buy ‚Äî then avoid buying ‚Äî Twitter, have raised investor concerns about a loss of focus by the EV-maker‚Äôs all-important CEO, it‚Äôs not the only problem for Tesla.

Tesla has faced performance issues with supply chain delays and shutdowns in China causing production bottlenecks, leading to a disappointing third quarter sales report Sunday that fell well short of Wall Street expectations.

On Friday, shares were down 27% from April 1, the day before Musk‚Äôs investment in Twitter was disclosed. And they were down another 8% in midday trading Monday following the sales report.

Critics of Tesla have long argued the stock‚Äôs incredible runup ‚Äî shares rose nearly 1,900% from when the company finally achieved profitability in the fall of 2018 to its peak price in early April ‚Äî was never justified. And they say the current problems are a sign of future setbacks to come with the stock.

‚ÄúIn general, very bad things happen when production slows, prices drop and the market is crediting you with a forward price to earnings multiple of 45.3 times earnings estimates,‚Äù said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the biggest Tesla bears on Wall Street.

But Tesla fans on Wall Street predict that the company is still well positioned as demand grows for electric vehicles.

‚ÄúIn a nutshell, this quarter was nothing to write home about and the Street will be disappointed by the softer delivery number in the third quarter‚Äù said Daniel Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. ‚ÄúThat said, we view this more of a logistical speed bump rather than the start of a softer delivery trajectory.‚Äù

Tesla spent last Friday showing off its latest robots, and in a series of tweets over the weekend, Musk was again promising that its robot business would transform the company‚Äôs sales and profitability. Ives said the timing of the company‚Äôs AI day was bad for the stock‚Äôs valuation.

‚ÄúEven though it‚Äôs visionary, I think it‚Äôs not reading the room. There‚Äôs a view he‚Äôs not focused on what needs to be done right now,‚Äù said Ives. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a great look for Wall Street when you do an AI Day on Friday and have a delivery miss on Sunday.‚Äù

But this is not the first time that Musk‚Äôs comments have caused problems for the stock‚Äôs value over the last six months.

Two new plants Tesla opened in Texas and Germany were described by Musk as ‚Äúgigantic money furnaces,‚Äù burning through billions in cash as they struggled to ramp up production. He even mentioned the risk of bankruptcy in one interview.

As if all of that hasn‚Äôt been enough of a headwind for Tesla shares, Musk came out and said in June he had a ‚Äúsuper bad feeling‚Äù about the economy and announced plans to trim salaried staff.

‚ÄúMusk has put fuel into a fire, and the Twitter fiasco has added to what has been a nightmarish six months for the stock,‚Äù Ives said.

But the problems for Tesla shares aren‚Äôt unique.

Many of the other high flying tech stocks have suffered similar declines in the last six months. The market turned bearish as central banks around the globe sent interest rates soaring, prompting worries about a possible global recession.

Apple (AAPL) shares fell 21% over the second and third quarters, while shares of Google (GOOG) parent Alphabet tumbled 31%, and Facebook parent Meta (FB) plunged 39%. Amazon (AMZN) shares lost 31%.

That market environment makes it all the more critical that Tesla improve its execution as a way to assure investors its stock value isn‚Äôt all smoke and mirrors.

‚ÄúYou need to execute to keep faith among growth investors,‚Äù Ives said. ‚ÄúThe last two quarters, they haven‚Äôt lived up to that standard.‚Äù",Why Elon Musk is no longer Wall Street's darling,non-causal,"TWTR, FB, TSLA, EV, CEO, AAPL, AI, AMZN, GOOG",['MD'],[],"['FB', 'GOOG', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'EV', 'CEO', 'AAPL', 'AI']","['FB', 'GOOG', 'MD', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'FDX', 'EV', 'CEO', 'AAPL', 'AI']",0.9991229

The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, or 333 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8%.

SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) was closed by regulators and its deposits placed under control of regulators to protect depositors.

The news sparked widespread fears of a spillover into the broader banking sector, with regional banks, which tend to have less diversified funding sources than their larger peers, in the firing line.

Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) and First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) were down more than 18%, while JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo &Company (NYSE:WFC) were in the green amid expectations that depositors will seek safety in larger banks.

The turmoil in banks triggering worries about a systematic banking crisis forced investors to rethink their bets on larger rate hikes at the Federal Reserve‚Äôs March meeting even as job gains in February topped estimates.

The U.S. economy created 311,000 jobs last month, well above expectations, though there were some signs of softening in the labor market including a tick up in the unemployment rate and slower wage growth.

‚ÄúIt is hard to say that cracks are forming in the labor market when payrolls increase 311k, but it seems like we are at least at the ""beginning of the beginning"" of the process of seeing the labor market soften,‚Äù Jefferies said in a note.

Investors reined in the bets on a 50 basis points rate hike in March to 50% from about 80% a day earlier, according to Investing.com‚Äôs Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Treasury yields, which had jumped to their highest level in more than a decade earlier this week, fell sharply, helping the broader market pare some losses.

On the earnings front, DocuSign's (NASDAQ:DOCU) better-than-expected quarterly results were overshadowed by an announcement that its chief financial officer Cynthia Gaylor would step down later this year.

Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), meanwhile, reported mixed fourth-quarter results as revenue missed Wall Street expectations, sending the stock more than 3% lower.

Following the results, Goldman Sachs reiterated its sell rating on Oracle amid worries about market share losses in the database market, expectations for a slowdown in subscription services revenue and the impact of capital expenditure pressure on margins.

Elsewhere Gap (NYSE:GPS) reported a wider quarterly loss and guidance which fell short of Wall Street estimates. Credit Suisse described the guidance from the retailer as ‚Äúsobering,‚Äù but said there was ‚Äúless risk of further downward revisions beyond the initial guidance.‚Äù

San Franciso was once one of American Airlines‚Äô largest flight attendant hubs and a launching point for West Coast trips, but it has shrunk by about 40% in recent years and is now among the smaller bases. To compare, American has nearly 6,000 flight attendants based at DFW International Airport, its largest hub.

‚ÄúOver the past few years, American‚Äôs network and schedule have evolved based on a number of factors, including our size, shifting customer demand and changes to our fleet,‚Äù said spokeswoman Sarah Jantz in a statement. ‚ÄúAs we look at the future of our network, we expect that San Francisco will maintain the same level of flying it does today, but there are no plans to grow San Francisco and no future flying prospects based on our current network strategy.‚Äù

American closed its pilot base in San Francisco in 2011.

Flight attendants will have the chance to move to one of American‚Äôs 10 other bases, but will have to go somewhere other than Los Angeles because that base is already overstaffed with the reduction in flying to Asia because of COVID-19 restrictions in places such as China, said Association of Professional Flight Attendant spokesman Paul Hartshorn.

The loss from streaming will increase by $100 million this period because of shifting marketing costs, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said Wednesday on a conference call with analysts. The stock fell as much as 4.8% to $96.26.

Disney‚Äôs direct-to-consumer segment, which includes the flagship Disney+ streaming service, suffered a loss of $659 million in the just-ended fiscal second quarter, the company said. That was significantly lower than the $850.3 million that analysts projected and less than half what it was just two quarters ago.

But a wider loss this period, which McCarthy characterized as a ‚Äúlittle blip,‚Äù rows back some of the progress Disney has made toward achieving profitability in its streaming businesses. The company is simultaneously seeing a sharp decline in its traditional TV business, which includes ABC and ESPN.

To improve the financial performance of its streaming business, the company introduced a new ad-supported tier for Disney+ in December and raised the price of the ad-free version by 38% to $11 a month.

‚Äú2023 is a transitional year with 3Q streaming losses expected to rise to around $800 million.‚Äù

While boosting revenue, the move appeared to cost the company customers: Paid subscriptions to Disney+ fell to 157.8 million. Analysts had expected 163.1 million. It‚Äôs the second straight quarter that Disney+ has lost subscribers.

Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said on the call with analysts that the Burbank, California-based company plans to increase the price of the ad-free Disney+ service again this year. Disney also will be removing films and TV shows from its services to reduce costs, leading to a charge of up to $1.8 billion.

Iger plans to combine Hulu and Disney+ content on a single app later this year. The move suggests the company will ultimately buy Comcast Corp.‚Äôs one-third stake in Hulu. The two companies have an agreement for Disney to purchase that stake starting next year in deal that values Hulu at a minimum of $27.5 billion. Hulu subscriptions were flat in the second quarter.

Comcast and Disney have held ‚Äúcordial‚Äù talks, Iger said.

Wall Street‚Äôs view of the streaming TV industry has shifted over the past year, with investors now focused more on profitability than subscriber growth. Disney‚Äôs red ink from streaming ballooned under former CEO Bob Chapek, who was ousted in November after the company reported a quarterly loss of nearly $1.5 billion.

Total revenue at Disney rose 13% to $21.8 billion in the period that ended April 1, driven by strong performance of the company‚Äôs theme parks. Adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share decreased from the same period last year.

The company‚Äôs resorts and consumer products unit boosted income by 23% to $2.17 billion, in part due to a return to profitability for the company‚Äôs international theme parks.

Profit at Disney‚Äôs traditional TV business, including the ESPN cable networks and ABC‚Äôs broadcasting business, fell 35% to $1.83 billion, the result of higher sports programming costs and lower advertising.

Last week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and Paramount Global reported significant drops in revenue from TV advertising.

Under Iger, Disney has overhauled its structure by creating three reporting units: Entertainment, Parks and ESPN, which includes the sports network and the ESPN+ streaming service.

As part of a plan to Disney on a better financial footing, Iger‚Äôs cutting $5.5 billion in annual costs and culling 7,000 jobs from the entertainment giant‚Äôs workforce. The recent cost cutting led to the departure of streaming chief Michael Paull and most of the product and technology teams that supervised the successful rollout of Disney+ in 2019.

But investment strategist Amy Kong says stocks are still attractive. On Tuesday, the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury rose to its highest level since 2007, topping 5%, as investors weighed the prospect of more interest rate hikes. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury also briefly topped the key 4% level earlier in the same session. Higher bond yields are typically bad news for investors in stocks. Bonds compete with stocks for investor dollars, so when bond yields rise, stock prices can go down. But Kong said she's not getting out of stocks just yet. ""We continue to be constructive on stocks relative to bonds and cash but recognize risks have escalated,"" Kong, who is chief investment officer at CI Barrett Private Wealth, told CNBC's "" Street Signs Asia "" on Wednesday. She acknowledged that stocks face a challenging medium-term outlook, given headwinds such as expected earnings declines and margin pressures. But Kong remains upbeat on the longer term. ""We think the short term continues to be quite volatile for stocks in general and growth in particular, but the longer-term stories of some of these growth-type names continues to be compelling to us,"" she said. ""It really is the innovation of many of these business models and earnings that has kept these stocks attractive from our perspective over the long run and we expect them to continue to lean on innovation to grow earnings per share through a fuller business cycle,"" she added. Stock picks One of Kong's top core holdings is JPMorgan Chase . She noted that the bank has been able to take advantage of its size and brand, and she is ""OK"" with the bank spending ""more than necessary"" in recent quarters to gain some market share. Kong is also a fan of CEO Jamie Dimon's leadership. Within tech, she favors Microsoft , calling it a ""stellar company"" with a good business model. She added that the company is generating a lot of free cash flow and is more attractive than Alphabet . Microsoft also has ""a lot more growth engines,"" according to Kong, while its cloud computing business also remains ""healthy,"" with expected growth of about 30% over the next quarter. Kong is also a fan of Apple .

The rapid rate hikes are intended to cool economic growth, and investors have been nervously speculating about where the impact of the rate hikes would first appear. Would it show up as an economic recession, evidenced by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth? Perhaps higher rates would trigger a sharp uptick in corporate defaults, particularly in riskier subprime loans and high yield bonds? Would the rate hikes cause consumers and businesses to curtail spending, triggering an earnings recession marked by lower corporate profits?

Thus far, none of the above have shown a concerning level of impact from the Fed rate hikes. GDP growth for Q1 did decline, from 2.6% in Q4 of 2022 to 1.1%, but considering that nearly every major investment bank was calling for negative or flat GDP growth when they issued their annual market outlooks, a positive 1.1% rate of growth is something of a victory for the US economy and aligns with our Annual Outlook forecast for the US to narrowly avert recession. The resilient US consumer has continued to spend aggressively, buoyed by full employment and rising wages, despite higher prices for goods and services.

Likewise, corporate bond defaults have remained manageable despite some high-profile instances such as Bed Bath and Beyond and Silicon Valley Bank. The trailing 12-month (TTM) default rate for US high yield bonds reached 1.8% in March, up from historic lows but still below the long-term historical average of 3.6%. Current forecasts from Fitch Ratings suggest 2023‚Äôs high yield TTM rate will top out in the 3-3.5% range, which would still be below the historical norms and far below what occurred in prior recessionary environments, such as 2008-2010, when high yield default rates peaked around 22%.

And what of earnings? Analysts were near-unanimous in calling for a first-quarter earnings recession, a valid assumption as most companies were careful to temper expectations for 2023 growth when they issued guidance at the end of 2022. FactSet data showed expectations for a 6.7% decline in Q1 earnings, based on aggregated analyst forecasts. We are roughly halfway through Q1 earnings and thus far, that decline is looking more like -3.7%, the second straight quarter of declining earnings, but not as bad as initially thought.

Furthermore, 77% of S&P 500 companies have beaten analyst targets for earnings, above the 10-year average beat rate of 73%. Earnings are coming in 6.9% above estimates, which is also above the 10-year average of 6.4%. Positive surprises are also showing up in revenue data, with 74% of S&P 500 companies beating estimates, outperforming the 10-year average of 63%. Revenue beats are also outperforming 10-year averages, at 2.1% above estimates compared to the 10-year average benchmark of 1.3%.

While there may have been some sandbagging of expectations leading up to Q1 earnings, the fact remains that corporate earnings are not suffering in a significant way due to the Fed rate hikes. Rather, most companies have been able to simply pass on higher input costs to consumers, who have willingly continued to spend money despite their grumblings over the cost of eggs, gas, and other household staples. A recent research paper from economists at the University of Massachusetts suggests corporations have been able to pad their profit margins by implementing price hikes that exceeded the cost of inflation, resulting in record high profit margins.

Corporations were able to pull this off because price hikes (or shrinkage of product sizes) have been implemented in a unified fashion, leading consumers to accept the rationale that supply chain bottlenecks and higher input costs are solely to blame. This has instilled companies with confidence that they can raise prices without damaging their brand image and products demand, and thus far, this assumption has proven correct. Corporate profit margins hit their highest levels since the 1950s last year, and while they have declined from the peak, remain above pre-pandemic norms.

While this form of quasi-coordinated price gouging is bad for the average household budget, it has been a boon for corporate earnings. Companies will be loath to give up these higher margins and will try to maintain higher prices permanently unless consumer spending behavior changes dramatically. It is no coincidence that, thus far with half of the sector‚Äôs earnings in, 100% of Consumer Staples sector stocks have beaten earnings estimates.

Energy sector stocks have also been strong outperformers, as has the largest sector by market cap, Technology. Among big Tech names, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) posted strong earnings this quarter and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) turned a profit in its cloud business segment for the first time on record. While big Tech layoffs made headlines early in the year, many reports failed to point out that these layoffs represent a fraction of the headcount added shortly after the start of the pandemic, and these companies continue to invest in their business and in many cases also aggressively buy back shares.

Whatever the underlying reasons, it appears that the widely forecasted earnings apocalypse has been postponed, and first quarter earnings will be better than expected. While higher yields on bonds have attracted investors to the detriment of equity markets, markets are forward-looking and investors will likely reassess EPS projections for 2024 considering the Q1 earnings performance, which could lead to upward revisions for next year and lead to inflows to equity markets. Markets have proven remarkably resilient throughout the Fed rate hike cycle, and while we are not yet in the clear, thus far we have avoided worst-case outcomes in several areas of concern. Strong corporate earnings are an encouraging sign; now, we wait and watch the inflation data to see if the Fed can defy expectations and pull off the coveted soft landing.",Resilient Earnings Are A Positive Sign,causal,"TTM, US, EPS, MSFT, GDP, GOOG, META",[],[],"['GDP', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'META', 'TTM', 'EPS', 'US']","['GDP', 'DFS', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'META', 'TTM', 'EPS', 'US']",0.9828509

‚Ä¢ Cloud, increasingly important to Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, is slowing down in the short term.
‚Ä¢ But whoever successfully integrates AI could dominate the market.

Microsoft opened Wednesday with a 4% share price drop after the firm gave a tough outlook for its cloud business during third-quarter earnings Tuesday. But the company has a longer-term strategic weapon that could help it win the cloud wars: its once-in-a-generation bet on OpenAI.

Reporting fiscal Q1 earnings on Tuesday, Microsoft forecast that its cloud business Azure would slow by 4-5 percentage points in the coming quarter. The deceleration is down to customers shying away from expensive cloud deals in a tough macroeconomic environment. The unit generated $25.7 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, up 24% year on year.

Cloud computing has taken off over the last decade as a way for blue-chip businesses to store massive amounts of information on servers run by the major tech firms, rather than on-premise. For the most part, it's faster, more secure, and flexible.

It's also a huge revenue driver for Big Tech, whatever their public spiel about self-driving cars and acrobatic robots. An outage at market leader Amazon's AWS can take down large swathes of the internet. Any hint of a slowdown in growth for Microsoft's Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Google Cloud tends to provoke analyst angst.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ‚Äî who once ran its cloud division ‚Äî accordingly provoked some of this angst as he warned that the firm's Azure customers were beginning to ""optimize"" their cloud spend after a pandemic binge.

But, he added: ""We fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave is going to be AI and we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack and also create new solutions and new opportunities.""

Even if there are immediate challenges for cloud growth, Microsoft sees its OpenAI bet, reported to be worth $10 billion, as a bigger strategic move. As a gamble, it looks smarter than, say, the metaverse.

In a blogpost announcing the deal, Microsoft noted that its investment in the developer behind the generative AI chatbot would help it build ""leading AI infrastructure"" for Azure. In practice, this means developing cloud technologies that are purpose-built for AI, giving it an edge at a time when excitement among developers for AI is peaking.

Microsoft's gamble, essentially, is that everyone will need and use artificial intelligence in the near future ‚Äî and that means increased demand and cash for the computing power to train AI models.

A research note on Wednesday from Jefferies analysts noted Microsoft ""sees AI innovation as driving growth for Azure AI services,"" with revenue from Azure ML, a cloud segment dedicated to training AI models, increasing more than 100% over the past five quarters.

Microsoft also suggested in its post that it will make Azure the ""exclusive cloud provider"" of OpenAI's research and products.

All of this is ""mostly about cementing Azure's edge over AWS"" as Microsoft ""has exclusive access to the hottest AI property on the market right now,"" according to Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile.

Windsor thinks that much of the money Microsoft is committing to OpenAI will revolve around ""building custom infrastructure"" to run OpenAI's technology in an efficient way, given that ""during busy times, response times increase materially"" for its scary-smart chatbot, ChatGPT.

The bet is that Azure could offer OpenAI to customers in a way that none of its rivals can immediately replicate.

""Should OpenAI's products become popular with clients, this will give Azure firepower in its quest to close the gap on AWS,"" he said.

With cloud spend tightening, it's likely that Amazon and Google will look to give their cloud divisions a shot in the arm too with AI to stay competitive. Amazon will want to retain its lead position, Google is pursuing an aggressive growth plan.

""This isn't a vacuum,"" said Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight. ""You can imagine Amazon is not going to be sitting on its laurels or waiting there for Microsoft to surpass it.""

Cloud represents a growing slice of Big Tech's respective revenue pies. Microsoft Cloud, which also includes revenue from Office 365 and other products as well as Azure, represented around 50% of the company's overall revenue. In Amazon's last earnings, AWS represented around 16% of its overall earnings, while Google Cloud's $6.9 billion in revenue at the end of the September quarter represented 10% of overall revenue.

These percentage figures are likely to get bigger.

In a research note on Tuesday, Wedbush analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris wrote that cloud and the underlying Office ecosystem ""is going to comprise a bigger and bigger piece of Redmond going forward and will ultimately spur growth and margins"" despite the downturn.

""We believe the shift to cloud is still less than 50% penetrated and represents a massive opportunity for Nadella & Co. going forward despite the dark storm clouds forming for FY23 in the uncertain macro backdrop,"" the Wedbush analysts said.

There is pressure right now on cloud spend, with Wedbush predicting some ""larger cloud deals"" in the financial sector will likely get downsized for Microsoft as companies rein in costs.

But the AI genie is out of the bottle, as evidenced by the proliferation of activity around ChatGPT.

Comcast shares have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the year-to-date period (+36.7% vs. +24.1%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.



Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.



However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.

Shares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date (+19.5% vs. +11.3%). With a wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company's primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.



Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages. Linde reported strong second quarter earnings aided by higher pricing from its Americas segment.



However, increasing competition for new projects and developments in emerging markets is concerning. The firm is extremely vulnerable to uncertainty associated with the slowdown of economic growth, as this could hurt demand for its industrial gases.

Marsh & McLennan's shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the year-to-date period (+19.1% vs. +14.4%). The company is well-poised to grow on the back of acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses.



Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. Solid cash flows enable business investments. MMC had around $3.7 billion left under authorization as of Jun 30, 2023.



However, escalating operating costs might weigh on the margins. The metric jumped 6.1% y/y in 1H23. A debt-laden balance sheet is a concern. Its valuation remains stretched at the current level. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

Google's office software suite now has over 9 million paying organizations, the company told Insider.

Workspace, formerly known as G Suite, has grown to three billion users as of October 2021. Under Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, the organization has made a major push to win over large organizations, including Korean Air, Wayfair, Airbus, and the U.S. Army. Now, it's also rolling out new AI features across the Workspace suite. Google announced Tuesday that it will begin testing those features in Gmail and Google Docs.

Workspace users will be able to generate documents or compose emails by entering basic prompts, such as asking Google Docs to create ""a job post for a sales rep."" Other planned generative AI features include generating new backgrounds in Google Meet and conjuring images, audio, and video in Google Slides.

Workspace's biggest competitor is Microsoft Office, whose Office 365 product has 345 million paid commercial seats as of last year and has a stronghold among large enterprise customers. Employees at Workspace told Insider that it was often difficult to sell Workspace to companies that were already Microsoft shops.

Workspace's latest push into generative AI, as well as its cloud-first products, could help give it an edge. Microsoft, which invested in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, plans to incorporate the widely popular chatbot into its Office products, the Information first reported.

Workspace is part of Google Cloud. The unit surpassed $7 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, but it is still unprofitable. It has decreased losses to $480 million, down from $890 million last year. Workspace's subscription model could be an opportunity for the unit to close its margins.

‚Ä¢ Automakers say they are racing to change that.
‚Ä¢ But supply-and-demand means they've actually driven prices up.

The auto industry's scramble to make more affordable electric cars has actually driven the price of these vehicles up ‚Äî at least in the short term.

The industry is desperate to build less expensive electric vehicles for the masses because (alongside concerns around range and charging availability) price is one of the biggest barriers to mass EV adoption.

The new EVs cost an average of $65,041 in November, according to Kelley Blue Book, while gas cars averaged $48,681 that month.

Automakers say they are doing all they can to introduce cheaper EVs. For instance, the Chevrolet Equinox SUV EV, to launch in 2023, should start around $30,000. Many have long been targeting that number, though Tesla somewhat tapped out of the race this year. Elon Musk told investors earlier this year his company wasn't prioritizing the $25,000 EV anymore.

High EV prices stem, in part, from the domination of luxury vehicles in the market. Ford's F-150 Lightning electric pickup starts at nearly $56,000; the GMC Hummer EV costs more than $100,000. Startup Rivian tacked a $73,000 based price tag onto its R1T truck, and Lucid raised the price of the cheapest variant of its Air sedan to $87,400.

But the more stubborn problem comes from the battery industry and the simple law of supply and demand.

The world of batteries influences your EV's price tag

Automakers are pouring more than $515 billion into all-electric lineups over the next several years. GM and BMW are planning for at least 50% of their new vehicle sales to be EV by 2030, and GM wants to eliminate all emissions-producing cars by 2035. Ford's targeting 40% of its global cars sold electrified by 2030. Mercedes is only making newly launched cars electric starting in 2025. Scaling up will inherently make electric cars less expensive over time.

But in the short term, the surge in demand was enough to reverse a decade-long decline in battery prices, according to a recent analysis from BloombergNEF. This year, prices for crucial lithium-ion batteries rose about 7%.

It's simple: The more EVs that carmakers plan to make, the more they need raw materials for their batteries. The less available supply there is, the higher the prices for those materials can go ‚Äî and the more expensive your battery is overall.

The demand has ultimately sparked a frenzy that continues to make the battery the most costly part of an EV.

The price of lithium alone skyrocketed 500% this year, according to McKinsey. That metal could be the biggest roadblock to cheaper EVs.

""You're going to have more and more people trying to source larger quantities of the supply of lithium to make sure that they have whatever they need to operate for the next fiscal year,"" Craig Dillard, partner at firm Foley & Lardner, told Insider in the fall.

""They need to be thinking about where the material is sourced,"" Dillard said, and ""how much the price of lithium impacts not only their profitability, but also pricing in general for their products.""

Some signals suggest that might not be the case for long.

Higher adoption of lower-cost battery mixes plays a role alongside recycling, as will easing lithium prices as a result of more extraction and refining coming online.

""We'll see an excess of demand relative to supply building up over the next few years,"" said McKinsey partner Andreas Breiter ‚Äî driving costs up.

But, driving costs back down, he says: ""The lithium prices will trigger more supply to enter the market.""",The race to make electric cars cheaper is making electric cars more expensive,non-causal,"BMW, SUV, EV, GM, GMC",['SBA'],['SBA'],"['GM', 'BMW', 'SUV', 'GMC', 'EV']","['GM', 'BMW', 'SUV', 'SBA', 'GMC', 'EV', 'SBAC']",-0.9915419

Some of the slower rent growth can be attributed to so-called seasonality, or the idea that certain months of the year yield a smaller increase in rents than others, but it is also speaks to a shift in consumer behavior. 

The drop-off is more dramatic in certain cities, mirroring some of Equity Residential's data: The US' two largest gateway cities, New York and San Francisco, saw rents slip 2.3% and 2.6% respectively that month, while the pandemic hotspot of Des Moines, Iowa, saw its rents decline by 5.4%, according to Zumper.

The S&P 500 rose 54 points, or 1.3%, to close at 4,146 on Thursday after a report showed inflation at the wholesale level slowed last month by more than expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 380 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite was 2% higher, leading the market on hopes slower inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates.

A separate report showed slightly more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, though the job market remains remarkably resilient. A less-tight job market could take more pressure off inflation. That plus the inflation report underscored traders' expectations that the end is near for the Fed's rate hikes.

""Bad news is once again good news for stocks,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a Thursday research note. But the news may not be quite bad enough to keep things going in the right direction for the Fed, he added.

""The latest jobless claims report does support the narrative that the labor market is gradually weakening, but it is still relatively near historically low levels,"" wrote Moya. ""Jobless claims are now at the highest levels in over a year, but overall the labor market is still relatively strong. For disinflation trends to continue throughout the summer, labor market weakness will need to pick up.""

Market holding steady after over one year of hikes

Inflation and how high the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates to tame it have been at the center of Wall Street's struggles for more than a year. The Fed has hiked rates at such a feverish pace over the last year that it's already slowed parts of the economy and caused strains to appear in the banking system.

A less aggressive Fed would help Big Tech stocks in particular. High-growth stocks are seen as some of the most vulnerable to higher rates, and Apple, Microsoft and Amazon were the three biggest forces lifting the S&P 500 after each rose at least 1.9%.

The Fed has hiked rates at every one of its meetings since early last year, often by double or triple the usual amount. High rates can smother inflation but only by slowing the entire economy, raising the risk of a recession and hurting prices for investments.

High interest rates and still-high inflation are eating away at corporate profits, and the biggest U.S. companies are starting to tell investors how much they earned during the first three months of the year. Expectations are low, with forecasts calling for the sharpest drop in earnings since the pandemic was pummeling the economy in 2020.

Delta Air Lines was down 1% after flipping between gains and losses through the morning. It reported weaker results for the latest quarter than expected, but it also said customers still want to fly despite current economic challenges. It predicted a bigger-than-expected profit for the second quarter.

Investors are likely to focus more on such forecasts than on the backwards-looking results of the last three months. Even though forecasts for 2023 earnings have come down a bit, ""2023 consensus still looks optimistic if we are headed to a recession,"" equity strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a BofA Global Research report.

Several of the biggest banks will report their results Friday, potentially offering more clues. One of the fears on Wall Street is that recent turmoil in the banking system could cause a pullback in lending, which in turn could weaken the economy. The Fed's staff economists see such weakness potentially causing a mild recession later this year, the central bank said Wednesday.

The bond market has exhibited more concern about a possible recession than the stock market, with traders betting the Fed will have to cut interest rates later this year in order to prop up the economy.

Treasury yields fell immediately after Thursday's weaker-than-expected reports, before paring their losses and reversing through the morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.45% from 3.40% late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.

The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 3.99% from 3.97% late Wednesday.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs are more optimistic about the economy's prospects than many, forecasting only a 35% probability of a recession. But they also say prices in markets available now may mean not much upside is left.

The bond market may be looking for cuts to rates, but the Fed may have less room to lower them given how strong the job market is. Profit margins may also have little room to rise further, which would hamper stocks.

That leaves the possibility for further returns from stocks and bonds to be ""not as stellar as one might expect,"" Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs' chief economist and head of global investment research, said in a report.",Stocks hit highest level in 2 months as inflation cools,non-causal,,['US'],[],[],"['EQR', 'US']",0.21145417

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.

If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Ameren (NYSE:AEE). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.

If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Ameren has grown EPS by 6.7% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.

Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Ameren maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 25% to US$7.7b. That's a real positive.

The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.

You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Ameren's future profits.

Are Ameren Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Owing to the size of Ameren, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$114m. We note that this amounts to 0.5% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Ameren but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.

It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Ameren, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.

The CEO of Ameren only received US$4.3m in total compensation for the year ending December 2021. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.

Is Ameren Worth Keeping An Eye On?

One positive for Ameren is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Ameren, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Ameren (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.

‚Ä¢ The AI and search engine researcher said that the tech is ""definitely not ready for launch""
‚Ä¢ Bard, Google's new AI technology, has come under fire for a mistake it made in an advertisement.

It's not just Google's AI chatbot Bard that's messing up.

Earlier this week, Dmitri Brereton, an AI and search engine researcher, pointed out that Bing's new AI chatbot made a number of errors during its demo ‚Äî and said that it's ""definitely not ready for launch.""

As part of Microsoft's unveiling of the new tech, Bing's AI was asked to list the pros and cons of the three best-selling pet vacuums. The chatbot made a list for the ""Bissel Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum,"" with cons including its noise level and short cord.

The problem? When Brereton compared what the chatbot said to the article it linked to as a source, he noticed that that review didn't mention the vacuum's noisiness. Plus, it's cordless.

""I hope Bing AI enjoys being sued for libel,"" he wrote.

In another example, Bing was prompted to create a five-day itinerary for a trip to Mexico City and was asked for nightlife suggestions. It responded with a descriptive list of bars and clubs.

After cross-referencing the bot's answers with his own research, Brereton found some of the descriptions the bot spit out were wrong. In one case, the bot recommended going to a bar's website to book a reservation and check out its menu ‚Äî but neither reservations nor the menu are available on the bar's site. For two other bars, the bot said there were no reviews online. There are, in fact, hundreds for one and thousands for the other.

The most egregious mistake Bing made during its chatbot demo, Brereton said, was fabricating numbers after it was asked about the key takeaways from Gap's Q3 2022 financial report.

The technology mislabeled some of the numbers, like the adjusted gross margin, and other values, like diluted earnings per share, were ""completely made up.""

""I am shocked that the Bing team created this pre-recorded demo filled with inaccurate information, and confidently presented it to the world as if it were good,"" Brereton concluded.

""We're aware of this report and have analyzed its findings in our efforts to improve this experience,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Insider. ""We recognize that there is still work to be done and are expecting that the system may make mistakes during this preview period, which is why the feedback is critical so we can learn and help the models get better.""

Brereton isn't the only user who has caught Bing's mistakes.

A writer at The Verge asked Bing to list the movies showing in a particular London neighborhood. The bot answered with ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" and ""The Matrix Resurrections"" ‚Äî two old movies that were found to not actually be splaying.

The AI arms race may lead to the spread of misinformation

Brereton's observations come as Big Tech companies like Google and Microsoft enter an AI arms race.

Google and Microsoft both demoed new chatbots to the public last week. Though Microsoft was first to release its new technology, Google plans to release its chatbot, Bard, in just a few weeks. (An ad for Google's new tech showed the company's chatbot making an error of its own.)

Even before Bing's errors were revealed, Gary Marcus, a former professor of neural science at New York University, noted in a blog post how the two companies were being pit against each other. Microsoft's demo ""was presented as a revolution,"" while Google's demo was presented as a ""disaster,"" he wrote.

The intense pressure to roll out these tools has led some in tech ‚Äî including John Hennessy, the chairman of Alphabet ‚Äî to say that they are being released prematurely. Google employees said the announcement of its tech was ""botched"" and ""rushed.""

The hasty releases may come at the cost of spreading misinformation, especially if people expect quick, accurate answers on search engines.

While Brereton told Insider that generative AI search engines like the new Bing can be ""quite transformative,"" he noted that releasing it prematurely ""could lead to big problems.""

""It's more dangerous with a search engine that millions of people trust for correct answers starts confidently dishing out garbage,"" Brereton said. ""Bing tries to solve this by warning people the answers are inaccurate. But they know and we know that no one is going to listen to that.""",It's not just Google ‚Äî closer inspection reveals Bing's AI also flubbed the facts in its big reveal,non-causal,AI,[],[],['AI'],"['AI', 'ABBV']",-0.9551953

t‚Äôs been a bad year to be a billionaire‚Äìand not just for those who blew up their businesses or got themselves arrested. After adding trillions to their collective fortunes in 2020 and 2021, the world‚Äôs richest people were rocked by 12 months of shaky stock markets, war in Europe and rampant inflation.

As a group, the planet‚Äôs billionaires have lost $1.9 trillion in 2022, according to Forbes‚Äô estimates, with their collective wealth dropping from $13.8 trillion on New Year‚Äôs Day to $11.9 trillion on December 9. The number of billionaires has fallen too, from 2,671 to 2,523, per Forbes‚Äô real-time tracker, as high-profile moguls like Sam Bankman-Fried, Kanye West and Rivian founder RJ Scaringe have dropped from the ranks.

No one has been hit harder than the world‚Äôs 300 or so tech billionaires, who have collectively lost more than $1 trillion in 2022. After a raucous couple years when the pandemic boom and overeager investors drove up tech stocks and startup valuations, things have plummeted back to Earth. Companies are slashing costs, laying off workers and pulling IPOs. Shares of Amazon have cratered by nearly 50%, helping knock more than $80 billion off founder Jeff Bezos‚Äô net worth. Google-parent Alphabet‚Äôs stock is down 36%, lopping more than $40 billion apiece from the fortunes of cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Microsoft stock has slid 27% through December 9, denting the riches of cofounder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer, though Gates‚Äô bad year is mostly his own doing: This summer, he made a $20 billion gift to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mark Zuckerberg, who Forbes categorizes as media & entertainment, is some $78 billion poorer this year, as shares of Facebook-parent Meta Platforms have fallen by 66%.

The biggest loser of 2022, by far, is Elon Musk, who Forbes classifies as an automotive billionaire since most of his net worth stems from electric vehicle maker Tesla. Musk has been reminded of that fact by investors, who have pushed Tesla‚Äôs stock price down 60% through December 20 this year, in part due to fears that Musk, who is also CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, is spending far too much time and money on his newest toy, Twitter (where he is also CEO‚Äìfor now). Musk has shed more than $115 billion of his wealth in 2022, by Forbes‚Äô count. He began the year the planet‚Äôs richest person by a huge margin, some $70 billion ahead of French luxury goods kingpin Bernard Arnault. Musk lost the top spot to Arnault earlier this month and his net worth has continued to plunge.

American billionaires have lost the most this year, with some $660 billion in collective wealth up in smoke. In addition to the heavy losses sustained by Musk and the nation‚Äôs tech billionaires, American entrepreneurs like Nike cofounder Phil Knight (who is down $18.3 billion), former Estee Lauder boss Leonard Lauder (-$9.8 billion) and Rocket Mortgage founder Dan Gilbert (-$8.1 billion) rank among the U.S. citizens who had the worst 2022.

China, which has faced Covid-19 challenges, domestic protests and slumping global demand, hasn‚Äôt fared much better. Chinese billionaires are down an aggregate $620 billion, with big losers including Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma (-$13.1 billion), who is reportedly living in Japan following China‚Äôs tech crackdown, real estate heir Yang Huiyan (-$11.6 billion) and bottled water mogul Zhong Shanshan (-$11.3 billion).

Meanwhile, the war with Ukraine continues to impact Russia‚Äôs richest people, who have been hit with sanctions and a struggling economy, leading to an estimated $150 billion drop in the total net worth of the nation‚Äôs billionaires.

Still, not everyone is doing poorly. New billionaires have emerged, including investing and sports magnate Todd Boehly and designer Tom Ford. And it‚Äôs been a great year for a handful of super-fortunate billionaires, including Colin Zheng Huang (+$11.1 billion), the Chinese billionaire behind e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, and Low Tuck Kwong (+$16 billion), who is known as the coal king of Indonesia.

Zoomo laid off eight per cent of its workforce with 27 staff members told to pack up their belongings.

The layoff comes just eight months after the company slashed its workforce by 16 per cent and fired 65 employees in October 2022.

The company has made drastic cutbacks despite securing $100million in funding over the last couple of years.

Co-founders Mina Nada and Michael Johnson have blamed global economic woes, with numerous giants in the e-commerce industry similarly reducing staff numbers.

The company said in a statement that the cuts would mainly hit the top line as they restructure their corporate office.

'Zoomo has made the difficult decision to reduce its overall headcount by eight per cent,' the company said.

'The restructure will accelerate our path to company-wide profitability in 2024.

'It primarily affects employees in our corporate head office, as we bring central overheads in line with regional profit.'

Zoomo secured $80million in funding in November 2021 and another $20million in in February 2022.

The $100 million raised by the company to keep it afloat were driven by Atlassian founder Mike Cannon-Brookes‚Äô Grok Ventures, who led both financing efforts.

Zoomo launched in 2017, offering e-bikes as part of a weekly subscription to gig workers.

The Sydney-based company also supplied e-bikes to grocery-delivery service Milkrun, which collapsed last month.

They've also serviced UberEats, Domino's and DHL after poaching executives from US rideshare companies Uber and Lyft.

After a business boom during the pandemic amid lockdowns, the tech sector has slumped in the post-Covid period.

Aussie software developer Atlassian slashed 500 jobs last month, along with fellow Sydney software firm Thoughtworks, which laid off 100 employees.

Tech powerhouses have similarly faced the brunt, with Facebook announcing their first layoffs ever, shedding 11,000 employees, and Google's parent company Alphabet cutting 12,000 jobs.

Darryl Richardson, who advocated for workers to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, posted his termination notice from Amazon on Twitter Sunday.

‚ÄúThis is BS,‚Äù he said on Twitter. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt give me no reason why.‚Äù

Richardson referred questions about his termination to the union, which didn‚Äôt immediately comment. Amazon, which has been fending off union campaigns around the country, didn‚Äôt immediately comment.

Amazon‚Äôs Bessemer employees in March voted 993 to 875 against joining the union during an election that remains in dispute because more than 400 contested ballots haven‚Äôt been counted and could influence the final result. The union lost a previous election there in 2021 by a two-to-one margin, but the National Labor Relations Board called a second vote after ruling that Amazon unlawfully interfered with the first election.

The labor board‚Äôs general counsel has repeatedly accused Amazon of illegally firing activists. In November, a federal judge in New York ordered Amazon to cease and desist from retaliating against employees for workplace activism. The company has denied wrongdoing.

Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, New York, voted last year to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union, a major defeat for the Seattle-based company. The leader of that union, Chris Smalls, alleges Amazon fired him for his workplace advocacy, back in March 2020. Amazon maintains Smalls was terminated for violating safety rules during the Covid-19 outbreak.

            The tech earnings train has gotten derailed on the very first stop and it's looking uglier by the minute: moments after Microsoft slumped after reporting otherwise solid earnings, and Texas Instruments guided below expectations again, it was Google's turn to disappoint and it did just that when it reported earnings that missed on revenue and EPS for the second consecutive quarter, sending GOOGL's stock sharply lower after hours (hardly a shock after the catastrophic Snapchat earnings last week).

Let's dig into what was another mediocre at best (if perhaps not as ugly as some had expected) quarter for Alphabet:

EPS $1.06, missing estimates of $1.25, down from $1.40 Y/Y
	Revenue $69.09 billion, up 6% Y/Y and 11% in constant currency,  and missing consensus estimates of $70.76 billion
	Revenue ex-TAC $57.27 billion, missing estimates of $58.18 billion
	Google advertising revenue $54.48 billion, missing estimates of $56.98 billion

	Capital expenditure $7.28 billion, missing the estimate $7.65 billion
	Number of employees 186,779, vs estimate 177,845
The result visually:



And a more detailed breakdown:



Commenting on the quarter, CEO Sundar Pichai was laconic: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. Product announcements we‚Äôve made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to both Search and Cloud, powered by AI, and new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts. We are focused on both investing responsibly for the long term and being responsive to the economic environment.‚Äù

Mercifully, CFO Ruth Porat kept her comment also rather brief, trying to spin an otherwise ugly quarter: ""Financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We‚Äôre working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities."" 

To the disappointment of some, there were no incremental stock buyback announcements but recall that just two quarters ago GOOGL announced plans to buy back an additional $70BN in Class A and Class C shares, and also unveiled the 20 for 1 stock split.

That said, Alphabet did repurchase another $15.4bn of stock in the quarter (the same as last quarter) , a sign of GOOGL management continued focus on capital allocation and balancing investments/margins in a post pandemic environment. That may explains why Alphabet‚Äôs cash hoard declined for a fourth straight quarter, falling to $116 billion from $125 billion in Q2, $134 billion at Q1, and $139.6 billion at the start of the year.

In kneejerk reaction, the stock was not happy  with the across the board miss, and GOOGLE stock is down some 5% after hours...

Suumit Shah, founder and CEO of Bangalore-based e-commerce company Dukaan, said that the bot, which was built by one of the firm's data scientists, could respond to initial queries instantly, compared to staff taking an average of one minute and 44 seconds.

Shah, who founded the company in 2020, said the layoffs were 'tough' but 'necessary,' during a time that many others in the tech industry and elsewhere are unsure about their job security as AI's presence grows.

The time taken to resolve a customer's issue also apparently dropped by almost 98 per cent on average when using the chatbot - from two hours and 13 minutes, to three minutes and 12 seconds.

His company's move is just a small part of the global trend towards AI, which has seen plenty of other job losses.

He tweeted in a thread: 'Given the state of [the] economy, startups are prioritizing ""profitability"" over striving to become ""unicorns,"" and so are we.'

Shah added that the job cuts have cut the cost of its customer support function by about 85 per cent, an area which had been a long-term problem for them.

Shah told CNN that the 23 layoffs were made in September, but his announcement was only on Monday.

He added that he believed 'in a future where AI and humans work together,' and that he was interested in also developing ways for AI to take over other parts of business.

The tech founder ended by saying that Dukaan were still hiring for multiple roles, which include roles in engineering, marketing and sales, according to their website.

However, the majority of viewers of the tweet were seemingly less impressed in his change to the company.

In particular, commenters seemed struck by the tone of the thread in the context of it relating directly to large-scale job losses.

Many saw it as showing a 'lack of empathy,' or as 'disrespectful' by the CEO.

One said: 'I don't think someone losing their jobs is something to boast about.'

This sentiment was echoed by many, with one adding that it was 'extremely disrespectful towards all the people who were laid off,' and 'leaves such a bad taste.'

Someone else responded with a clown emoji saying: 'This guy [is] feeling so bad about them that he posted an entire thread on it.'

Another described it as a 'new low' done for marketing, adding that 'you could've just said nothing.'

Shah responded to some of the criticism restating that 'it was a tough decision.'

He added: 'As expected, '""someone"" will get offended on behalf of ""someone else.""'

He then suggested that people on Twitter were only interested in reading about profitability than sympathy.

Responses, once again, suggested otherwise, with one person saying 'I pity the people who work for you. Also happy for people who got fired because they no longer have to work with you.'

However, Dukaan is certainly not the first company to drop staff in a switch towards AI, albeit not every CEO who does so tweets a thread about the decision.

Furthermore, in May, a report by the World Economic Forum predicts AI will lead to 83 million jobs being lost between now and 2027.

The jobs widely expected to be most at risk are those which involve low levels of emotional input, and follow a structured set of rules.

These may include analyst roles, software engineers, and accountants.

Other experts have given even starker warnings, such as the possibility of 80 per cent of human careers being taken by bots 'in the next few years,' as companies seek to gain a competitive advantage at the expense of their human workforce.

As a result, many industry leaders such as Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak have been calling for a pause in AI development, signing an open letter in March asking for a six-month hiatus.

The tech giant ‚Äî which faces a landmark antitrust suit seeking to break up the company‚Äôs alleged monopoly over online search, which begins next week ‚Äî was facing the class action brought by attorneys general in 36 states with 21 million consumers.

Details of the proposed settlement, which was revealed in court documents filed late Tuesday in San Francisco federal court, were not disclosed.

The two parties, including lawyers representing the attorney general for Utah which is leading the group of states, asked that a trial scheduled for Nov. 6 be canceled.

Google will find out if its settlement was approved during a status conference on Oct. 12.

Should the judge reject the settlement, ‚Äúthe parties shall be returned to their respective litigation positions,‚Äù the court documents say.

Representatives for Google and Utah AG Sean Reyes did not immediately respond to The Post‚Äôs request for comment.

The class-action suit was originally filed in July 2021, alleging Google monopolizes the Android app distribution and in-app purchases market.

Google ‚Äúenjoys a market share exceeding 90%, and it can set prices and exclude competitors at will,‚Äù the lawsuit alleged.

The company is facing similar lawsuits that allege that it has generated enormous profit margins from its Play Store by engaging in illegal tactics to preserve monopolies in selling Android apps and in-app goods.

They argue that Google has unlawfully mandated that some apps use the company‚Äôs payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales

Epic Games, which has brought such a claim, is not a party to the proposed Google Play settlement, founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

‚ÄúIf Google is ending its payments monopoly without imposing a Google Tax on third-party transactions, we‚Äôll settle and be Google‚Äôs friend in their new era,‚Äù he said, adding that if the settlement left the ‚ÄúGoogle tax‚Äù in place, the company will ‚Äúfight on.‚Äù

UnitedHealth Group jumped 7.2% after the health insurer's quarterly profit beat analysts' average estimate, as the industry bellwether's expenses came in lower than feared.

Rivals Humana and Cigna rose 2.9% and 4.4%, respectively.

Among big banks, JPMorgan Chase was marginally higher after rising as much as 2.7% in early trading on posting a 67% jump in profit as it earned more from borrowers' interest payments and benefited from the purchase of First Republic Bank.

Wells Fargo gained 0.8% after reporting a 57% rise in quarterly profit.

‚ÄúWe must do work at both timescales, the short term and the long term. We must address immediate needs and also work on laying the foundation for a better future,‚Äù Mr Bezos said in a speech while receiving the honour. ‚ÄúWhen people are in immediate danger, when crisis is looming, that is the time to jump in, get to work, and do whatever you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith the same resolve we must also work on the long term, fixing problems at the root, creating preconditions for permanent change,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúChange that uplifts. Change that creates empowerment and independence.‚Äù

The award, from the Galileo Foundation, which supports the work of the Catholic Church and Pope Francis, was also given to celebrity chef and humanitarian Jos√© Andr√©s.

In 2020, Mr Bezos founded the Bezos Earth Fund, with the goal of investing $10bn in climate crisis initiatives by the end of 2030. So far, according to the group‚Äôs website, it has granted $1.54bn dollars, though put the figure closer to $3bn.

Ms Scott, who became one of the richest people in the world after divorcing from Mr Bezos in 2019, has been far more philanthropic this year, according to observers.

Forbes magazine gave Ms Scott a 5, the highest rank on its philanthropy score metric , because she‚Äôs given away an estimated 20 per cent of her wealth, while Mr Bezos only got a 2, the second worst score, for giving in the range of 1 to 4.99 per cent of his money.

In March, Ms Scott announced she‚Äôs given more than $3.8bn to 465 non-profits since June of 2021, part of $12bn total in disclosed donations since 2019, when the philanthropist pledged to give away the majority of her wealth. That amounts to nearly a third of her estimated $49bn net worth.

In a blog post explaining her donations, which have gone to well-known organisations like Planned Parenthood and Habitat for Humanity, Ms Scott she ‚Äúwill keep at it until the safe is empty.‚Äù

In fact, Ms Scott has given away more money, more quickly than any other billionaire Forbes has ever tracked, according to the magazine, and she‚Äôs approaching giving totals of long-term mega-donors like Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg.

In November of 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund announced its first round of donations, that went to well-known environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the World Wildlife Fund, and the Nature Conservancy.

Some critics faulted the fund for focusing on so-called ‚Äúbig green‚Äù groups, rather than directing money towards groups focused on environmental justice and climate resilience in marginalised communities, where the effects of global heating and other climate crisis impacts will be felt most grievously.

The Climate Justice Alliance accused Mr Bezos of doubling down on ‚Äúphilanthropy‚Äôs inequitable modus operandi by funneling hundreds of millions into outdated, ineffective, top-down strategies that attempt to erase the frontlines.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis thoughtless, status-quo, self-serving strategy undermines the real systemic change we have been cultivating for decades in this most monumental fight against climate change, and for the protection of Mother Earth as we know her,‚Äù they added in a .

By late 2021, the Earth Fund had ramped up its giving even more, pledging an estimated $3bn, with a notable focus on groups ‚Äú .‚Äù

Despite Mr Bezos‚Äôs significant funding for climate efforts, which have made him the single largest funder of such work, his philanthropic and environmental record is more complicated than the Earth Fund alone.

For instance, unlike Ms Scott, Mr Bezos , a group of high-income individuals who have promised to give away the majority of their wealth to charity in their lifetime or their wills.

Instead, he says he‚Äôs poured , his aerospace company seeking to build reusable rockets, with the ultimate goal of supporting floating space colonies.

He has argued that this mission has an environmental focus, because he believes the Earth does not contain suitable resources on its own to support the wants and needs of growing world populations and their demands for energy.

""What happens when unlimited demand meets finite resources? The answer is incredibly simple: rationing,"" Mr Bezos said in a speech. ""It would lead to the first time where your grandchildren and their grandchildren would have worse lives than you did ‚Äî that‚Äôs a bad path.""

The billionaire consumes far more than his share of resources, according to researchers, who found that is carbon footprint is about 1,500 times greater than the global average .

Amazon‚Äôs climate work is fraught with contradictions as well. The company is a major investor in renewable energy, and to funding climate initiatives, but also has major business lines with fossil fuel companies, and has and groups.

‚ÄúA free and diverse press is the backbone of a healthy and vibrant democracy,‚Äù Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, told the Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee, which passed her bill on a 9-0 vote with two members abstaining. ‚ÄúThese dominant companies are padding their profit margins with locally produced news without adequately compensating the originators of that content.‚Äù

But while her colleagues on the committee supported the idea, they said it‚Äôs going to need some work.

‚ÄúI appreciate that a problem-solver legislator has agreed to tackle this,‚Äù said Assemblyman Steve Bennett, a Democrat representing Oxnard. ‚ÄúThe marketplace is a very hard place to try to regulate for an outcome. It‚Äôs hard to do this, but it‚Äôs important to try to do this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll support this, but at the same time, I have my eyes open about the ability to get to the goal.‚Äù

Wicks‚Äô bill, AB 886, the California Journalism Preservation Act, comes after the December collapse in Congress of a similar federal bill, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, carried by U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican.

Sponsored by the California News Publishers Association, to which this news organization belongs, Wicks‚Äô bill would work differently by requiring internet platforms to use binding arbitration to determine the percentage of advertising revenue to compensate news organizations. Australia and Canada have passed similar laws.

While the bill is backed by a number of print and broadcast news organizations, it is opposed by the ACLU of California, the California Chamber of Commerce, California Taxpayers Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some online news organizations including CalMatters and Lookout Santa Cruz.

Critics argued the bill would promote sensational ‚Äúclickbait‚Äù articles to drive up revenues, would force platforms to carry questionable content they oppose and wouldn‚Äôt save dying newspapers anyway.

‚ÄúThis bill is a wealth transfer to the same billionaires at vulture capital funds that buy up newspapers for pennies on dollar,‚Äù Katharine Trendacosta, associate director of policy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the committee.

Wicks, who sits on the privacy and consumer protection committee, said her bill would require the news organizations receiving revenue from technology platforms to spend 70% of it on journalists and news production, and that platforms still could refuse content that violates their terms of service.

She said her bill ‚Äúprovides a lifeline for news outlets by directing some of the revenue from ad dollars back to the print, digital and broadcast media that bear the entire cost of gathering and reporting news while tech platforms bear none.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to convince me that Google isn‚Äôt profiting off the backs of journalists,‚Äù said Assemblyman Bill Essayli, a Riverside Republican, who added that ‚Äúthey need to pay for the content they‚Äôre profiting off of.‚Äù

But he and some others noted that tech platforms don‚Äôt work the same way. Google connects users with websites featuring topics they‚Äôre searching for, while Facebook, users ‚Äî including journalists and publishers ‚Äî post photos, videos and links to articles they want their followers to see.

I have reservations about a bill applying to social media where news agencies are voluntarily putting content on social media,‚Äù Essayli said.

Committee Chair Jesse Gabriel, a Woodland Hills Democrat, said in voicing support that ‚Äúthis is something we need to do,‚Äù but also acknowledged that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs still more work that needs to be done here.‚Äù",California bill to make internet platforms pay for news advances ‚Äî with questions,non-causal,"ACLU, AB","['D', 'R']",[],"['ACLU', 'AB']","['R', 'DHI', 'D', 'ACLU', 'AB']",-0.99991435

The Flexibles segment‚Äôs net sales increased 4% year over year to $2,812 million. This included an unfavorable currency impact of 6% and price increases of 7%. Adjusted operating profit was $353 million, marking a 5% increase from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs figure.



The Rigid Packaging segment‚Äôs net sales were $830 million in the quarter under review, 4% higher than the prior-year quarter. Price increase of 10% was offset by an unfavorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted EBIT increased 6% year over year to $57 million.

As of the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023, Amcor had $837 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $775 million at fiscal 2022-end. The company generated $145 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2023 compared with $323 million in the prior-year comparable period. AMCR reported an adjusted free cash outflow of $61 million in the first half of fiscal 2023 against an inflow of $105 million in the comparable period of the last year. As of Dec 31, 2022, Amcor‚Äôs net debt totaled $6.07 billion.



Amcor repurchased 3 million shares for $40 million in the first half of fiscal 2023. AMCR targeted total share repurchases of $500 million for fiscal 2023. 



In the first half of fiscal 2023, the company returned approximately $400 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. The company‚Äôs board of directors hiked the quarterly cash dividend to 12.25 cents per share from the previous payout of 12 cents per share.



AMCR completed the sale of its Russia business on Dec 23, 2022, and received cash proceeds of around $365 million. This was in addition to approximately $65 million of cash on hand in Russia, which was repatriated upon the closing of the deal. Approximately $120 million of the cash received is expected to be invested in a range of additional cost-saving initiatives. The company expects to use the remaining amount in repurchasing shares up to $100 million and to repay debt.



In January 2023, Amcor announced that it entered an agreement to acquire Shanghai-based MDK., which is a leading provider of flexible packaging for the medical device segment. MDK has an annual sales of approximately $50 million. MDK's coating capabilities, medical paper-based packaging products and customer base will complement Amcor's portfolio, while strengthening its leadership position in the China and broader Asia Pacific medical packaging segment. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Amcor expects adjusted comparable constant currency EPS growth of 3-8% for fiscal 2023. The guidance factors in an 5-10% expected growth from the underlying business performance and a 2% gain from share repurchases. This will be partly offset by a negative impact of 4% related to higher interest expenses and tax. A stronger dollar will impact earnings by 4%. AMCR also anticipates a negative impact of 3% associated with the sale of its three plants in Russia.

Adjusted EPS is expected to be 77-81 cents. The company projects an adjusted free cash flow of $1-$1.1 billion.

Over the past year, Amcor‚Äôs shares have gained 1% compared with the industry‚Äôs 1.3% growth.

Amcor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            Things are starting to move fast.

Overnight, AMD stunned investors when it preannounced shockingly bad revenue and margin numbers, making a mockery of its own guidance from August, and signaling that between then and now - i.e., September - the global economy fell off a cliff.


In August, AMD saw Q3 margin of 54%; today it cut it to 50%
In August, AMD saw $6.7BN revenue, today it cut it to $5.6BN
In September the global economy imploded
‚Äî zerohedge (@zerohedge) October 6, 2022
The result pummeled AMD stock, hammered its chip sector peers and has nuked the broader Nasdaq which was down 3.5% at last check.

But AMD wasn't the only one to indicate that the bottom fell off the global economy in September: moments ago Fedex stock also plunged after Reuters reported that the division of the global logistics and freight giant that handles most of the company's e-commerce deliveries plans to lower volume forecasts because its customers plan to ship fewer holiday packages, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.

""We expect there to be downward adjustments to volume forecasts,"" Paul Melander, a FedEx Ground senior vice president said in a message to the unit's delivery contractors earlier this week. The new forecasts will be available on or about Oct. 21.

""These changes will reflect the latest information from customers about how they anticipate current conditions are likely to decrease their volumes this holiday season,"" Melander said, confirming what we all know: in September, the global economy has hit a brick wall, and the fall out is just starting to be felt.

FedEx leaked a preannouncement in the form of an internal memo, which it knew would be immediately leaked to the media, to warn the market of what is coming. There was another reason: the last thing FedEx wanted was to humiliate itself with a second public preannouncement in just two weeks, following the company's shocking preannouncement from Sept 15 when new CEO Raj Subramaniam basically warned that a global recession has arrived.


‚ÄúI think so. But you know, these numbers, they don‚Äôt portend very well,‚Äù Subramaniam said in response to Cramer‚Äôs question about whether the economy is ‚Äúgoing into a worldwide recession.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are a reflection of everybody else‚Äôs business, especially the high-value economy in the world,‚Äù he concluded.


Following the company's de facto second preannouncement in two weeks, FDX shares tumbled as much as 4% while peers such as UPS dropped over 3%...



... while the broader market was trading at session lows because between tech and logistics both in free fall, the only thing that can save the global economy - if only for a few months, of course - at this point is a powerful blast of either fiscal or monetary stimulus. While the former is not coming after November when Congress will be divided until at least 2024, that least only the Fed stepping in and preventing what will surely be a global depression if the Fed continues to ignore the coming bloodbath.

            Yesterday we saw mega cap GAMMA tech stocks slide with GOOGL tumbling 7.7%, a loss which extended another 4% on Thursday, after the company's search & AI event revealed a glitch in the company's AI algos. The loss - the worst in more than three months - slashed some $100BN in GOOGL market cap yesterday and another $50 today...



... because, as Goldman put it, ""the CEO of MSFT wants to go after their search business"" and sure enough Wednesday was the third worst percent change between GOOGL and MSFT (-7.37%) on a 5 year look back.



But is Google losing enough market cap that would wipe out some 420 S&P500 companies really merited? According to JPM senior TMT trader Ron Adler, the answer is a resounding no, and ""the response from investors around AI has been very emotional and devoid of reality."" Why? Because as Adler asks rhetorically ""will anyone change their homepage or no longer visit Google when looking for or thinking about looking for something? Probably not. Will we ever really use the name Bard in conversation? Also, probably not. How many of you use Siri or Alexa to conduct simple searches you do on your phone? A lot less than one would think. Old habits die hard, and Google will be hard to break.""

Below we excerpt from his full note:


Simply put, the outcomes are asymmetric for MSFT and GOOGL. Google is the incumbent, and AI presents the innovator's dilemma for Pichai. MSFT has been trying to make Bing happen since 2009 and has yet to make a dent. MSFT is investing a lot of money in AI in a market that has latched on to AI (like they have previously latched on to blockchain and dot-com before that). Nadella noted that gross margin in search would ""drop forever,"" and investors in GOOGL fear a potential scorched earth plan by MSFT to gain share.

MSFT's presentation Tuesday seemed innovative, vs. low expectations for Bing. The GOOGL presentation focused on maps and ways Google monetizes things. At the same time, MSFT's event (which was very desktop-focused on a mobile world) placed unnecessary import on Wednesday's GOOGL event.

The response from investors around AI has been very emotional and devoid of reality. Yesterday people were talking about how AMZN is behind on AI (they are not). AI/ML has been around for a while, but compute power, and better tools are making them mainstream; we've had chatbots for years (I'm 100% dating myself here but does anyone remember SmarterChild?).

Headlines of GOOGL's AI getting an answer wrong underscore the market's irrationality towards AI. Programming is moving towards a determinative path to one of statistics and probability. This migration won't be linear and clumsy (and who knows, it could even breed a Terminator). From a business standpoint, AI could also prove VERY deflationary, not just for tech but for society (remains to be seen).

We are in the early stages of understanding the impacts of AI, let alone fully grasping the implications of the technology. In the near to medium term, will anyone change their homepage or no longer visit Google when looking for or thinking about looking for something? Probably not. Will we ever really use the name Bard in conversation? Also, probably not. How many of you use Siri or Alexa to conduct simple searches you do on your phone? A lot less than one would think. Old habits die hard, and Google will be hard to break.


And here is Bernstein underscoring the same point: ""ChatGPT is a great piece of technology but MSFT is likely going to have a very tough time breaking into Google‚Äôs monopoly because they don‚Äôt control the channel.""

‚Ä¢ The London-based fintech has previously headed up targeted campaigns against Amazon and Coca-Cola.
‚Ä¢ The startup pools retail investors to lobby for change at large corporations.

Tulipshare, a London-based fintech that pools shareholders to vote on corporate governance issues, is launching in the US.

The activist investment platform, founded in 2020, enables users to invest in public companies for as little as $1. The startup then combines the shareholding of its 27,000-strong investor base to push corporations to do more on environmental and ethical issues.

""Most of our campaigns are US-focused, so it makes total sense for us to expand there and it's a natural next step,"" Tulipshare's CEO and founder Antoine Argouges told Insider.

""People are realizing that you can use your money to make a change and after a summer of bad news for the climate and economy we're utilizing people to drive significant change in some of the most powerful companies on the planet.""

One of Tulipshare's most high-profile campaigns to date was a proposal for an audit of working conditions at Amazon, which secured the backing of over 44% of the company's shareholders. The proposal was unsuccessful and faced stiff opposition from Jeff Bezos, who controls 9.8% of Amazon shares. Amazon had asked the SEC if it could avoid putting the proposal to a vote, insisting a matter of employee safety related to ordinary business operations.

""Issues like Amazon working conditions resonate across geographies,"" Argouges added and indicated more geographic growth would come in the future.

The company has been emboldened by recent guidance from the SEC making it harder for companies to restrict proposals from ballots and by the Commission's stronger stance on companies ""greenwashing.""

The company has spent eight months working towards getting a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the US.

Tulipshare has raised $11.8 million in funding to date and has two years of runway ahead, Argouges said. The company's CEO declined to indicate which states the company would target for its launch and added that securing a license was an expensive endeavor.

""It was a long, costly, and stressful process with regulations and we faced a lot of scrutiny from regulators,"" Argouges added. ""No one has built anything like this so it was difficult as expected but intense nonetheless, having an innovative model raises eyebrows.""

Tulipshare is set to have 50 campaigns live for the 2023 proxy season with the company also targeting around 100,000 users by the end of next year. The company is also in the process of raising a Series A funding round but Argouges was coy on timings and specifics.

""We are working towards scaleable profitability because the consumer fintech space is tough and competitive,"" he said. ""We can reach healthy unit economics with a smaller user base which is engaged and we're confident because we're not competing with platforms like Robinhood on user numbers.""

How nice for those who held the stock! It's also up 12% in about a month. This could be related to the recent financial results that were recently released - you could check the most recent data by reading our company report.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.

Check out our latest analysis for Baker Hughes

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During three years of share price growth, Baker Hughes moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Baker Hughes' earnings, revenue and cash flow.

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Baker Hughes, it has a TSR of 145% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

It's nice to see that Baker Hughes shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 0.7% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 0.5% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Baker Hughes better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Baker Hughes that you should be aware of before investing here.

The firm expects the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates higher, and for longer, than the consensus expects. So far in the current hiking cycle, housing and tech stocks (including crypto, software and cloud services) have experienced deep downturns and industrials are on their way to a contraction. ""The huge question ahead is whether consumer spending (~70% of GDP) will be the next shoe to drop,"" Wolfe analyst Chris Senyek said in a note Tuesday. ""While consumer spending is unlikely to 'fall off a cliff' (at least over the near term), we do expect U.S. real consumption growth to turn negative and disappoint relative to consensus expectations looking for growth of +1.1% in full-year 2023."" Wolfe compiled a list of stocks that are expensive and likely to underperform their peers ""in the quarters ahead."" Most of them have highly volatile gross margins, leaving them vulnerable to disappointing consumer spending. Here are 10 of the names: Hyatt Hotels is among the most vulnerable, with a 51% gross margin volatility, and one of the most expensive, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 43x earnings. It's followed in volatility by Peloton , with gross margin volatility of 31%. Tesla is the most expensive stock on the list, with an earnings multiple of 46x. It's gross margin volatility is 13%. Others on Wall Street are also pumping the brakes on Tesla. Bernstein reiterated its underperform rating on the stock Wednesday and Tesla dropped off a Goldman Sachs list of hedge fund darlings. DraftKings and Las Vegas Sands are also near the top in terms of gross margin volatility, at 26% and 25%, respectively. The latter is also expensive, with a P/E ratio of 35x earnings. Wolfe flagged several food stocks too, including hot dog and chicken producer Tyson Foods , potato processor Lamb Weston and poultry producer Pilgrim's Pride .

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.74%.

Coming into today, shares of the agricultural equipment manufacturer had lost 3.56% in the past month. In that same time, the Industrial Products sector gained 0.18%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.85%.

Investors will be hoping for strength from Deere as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 19, 2023. On that day, Deere is projected to report earnings of $8.51 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 24.96%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.78 billion, up 22.84% from the year-ago period.

Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $30.47 per share and revenue of $54.96 billion. These totals would mark changes of +30.88% and +14.71%, respectively, from last year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Deere. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher. Deere is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Investors should also note Deere's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 12.27. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.5.

Also, we should mention that DE has a PEG ratio of 1.

The civil rights audit, which has not been previously reported, has been months in the making and set to examine how the company‚Äôs diversity and inclusion policies and approach to content moderation may affect marginalized communities, including at its subsidiary YouTube, the people said. The move follows rivals like Facebook and Airbnb, which conducted audits in 2016 and 2020, respectively, and Apple, which last year pledged to do a racial equity audit after facing pressure from its shareholders.

Democratic lawmakers and civil rights leaders in 2021 called on Google to hire an independent auditor to vet its products and policies for potential racial biases and discriminatory practices, citing concerns that the company could be exacerbating inequities.

‚ÄúWe are concerned about repeated instances where Alphabet missed the mark and did not proactively ensure its products and workplaces were safe for Black people,‚Äù a group of Democratic lawmakers led by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) wrote to the company‚Äôs leadership in 2021.

Google had previously declined to publicly commit to a review or audit, drawing blowback from lawmakers and civil rights groups, who questioned its commitment to protecting the people of color who use its products.

‚ÄúRacial equity is a top priority for us, and we absolutely consult and seek input widely, and are transparent about our work,‚Äù Google spokesperson Jos√© Casta√±eda said in a statement at the time.

WilmerHale has advised at least two tech companies during their sales to Google, according to its website. It represented cloud computing company Orbitera during its 2016 sale to Google, and before that helped another cloud software firm, Stackdriver, when Google acquired it in 2014.

The law firm is currently representing Twitter in a case before the Supreme Court over whether social networks including YouTube can be held liable for terrorist content on their platforms.

Civil rights advocates say independent audits are a crucial mechanism for holding companies accountable for the way their products can adversely affect people of color within their user bases and workforces, and to ensure they are factoring questions about equity into its products.

While it‚Äôs unclear when Google first launched its review, the revelation arrives two years after Facebook made its own audit public and months after Apple committed to its own.

A 2021 report from tech site The Markup found Google blocked advertisers from using terms including ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù to designate which YouTube videos to place their ads on, while allowing them to use the term ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhite lives matter.‚Äù","Google conducting civil rights review, caving to years of pressure",non-causal,,[],[],[],['TGT'],-0.99928486

(NYSE:BLK), the largest asset manager in the world, reported reasonable earnings for the first quarter of 2023 despite a slowdown in revenue. Boosted by earnings that came in ahead of analyst estimates, BlackRock's stock surged higher in pre-market trading on April 14. The recent challenges faced by the financial services sector resulting from the failure of a few major banks led investors to approach BlackRocks earnings with caution, but the company, as it often does, delivered exceptional results.

‚Ä¢ None The intrinsic value of BLK

The stock is still valued at a premium over its closest rivals, but this is understandable given that BlackRocks profitability and scale are far superior to its main competitors. Building on the strength of its core product portfolio, I believe it's only a matter of time before BlackRock's share price passes the $1,000 mark. Unless it loses its market dominance (which is highly unlikely), it should just be a matter of waiting for the next big bull market.

For the first quarter of 20223, BlackRock reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.93, a 17% year-over-year decline. Revenue declined 10% to $4.2 billion driven by the challenges faced by global capital markets and a notable decline in performance fees. The company had to deal with unfavorable foreign exchange movements for most of the quarter as well, which weighed on revenue further.

The bright spot for BlackRock came in the form of positive fund flows. The company reported $110 billion of quarterly net inflows and $103 billion of long-term net inflows representing 5% organic asset growth. The diversified product portfolio of BlackRock came to the rescue in the quarter as investors pumped money into liquid assets and bond ETFs. Asset managers with a primary focus on equity markets are highly unlikely to have enjoyed positive fund flows in the first quarter which is yet to be seen - and BlackRocks performance from this front highlights how the company has set itself apart by offering high-quality investment products covering the entire investment spectrum.

Commenting on the stellar performance of BlackRocks ETFs, CEO Larry Fink wrote:

BlackRock ended the first quarter with assets under management of $9.09 trillion, comfortably retaining its spot as the clear leader of the global asset management industry. The company seems to have benefited from the deteriorating investor trust in regional U.S. banks amid the failure of a few high-profile banks last month. Some Americans who had previously parked cash in savings products offered by regional banks are slowly beginning to take their funds away from these banks to invest in bond products and other cash management products offered by BlackRock. With an investment grade credit rating from top credit rating agencies, and the potential for long-term returns that beat inflation (versus savings which are almost guaranteed to underperform inflation), more people are seeing investments with BlackRock as a safer option compared to savings.

The return of the bull

The asset management industry is fragmented, but leading companies in this space can use scale to build competitive advantages around their products. This is exactly what BlackRock has done in the past decade. The company has turned macroeconomic challenges into tailwinds with an impressive business strategy focused on long-term growth. For instance, the asset management industry was tipped to see an erosion of fees with the rise of passive investment products such as index funds. However, BlackRock has been able to turn this into an opportunity to grow with its iShares ETF offerings that cover a plethora of investing styles, markets and asset classes. After attracting clients through its passive investment product suite, BlackRock has successfully funneled many of them into actively managed products with higher fees. This has been the secret to BlacRocks success in the last decade, which was only possible because of the trust the company has gained from its clients.

These advantages put the company in a prime spot to take advantage of the next bull market. Moving forward, BlackRocks earnings growth should be supported by the strength of its ETF product portfolio, the companys ability to upsell actively managed products and innovative products backed by technological developments such as robo-advisory services.

For 2022, BlackRock reported adjusted earnings per share of $35.36, and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report EPS of $34.65 this year, marginally below last year. In the last five years, BlackRock has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of 19.07, which suggests the company is fairly valued as of this writing at a forward price-earnings ratio of 19.6.

By 2026, analysts expect BlackRocks EPS to surpass $51. If the company continues to trade at a price-earnings ratio of around 20, its stock price could easily surpass $1,000 by 2026 assuming these earnings estimates are met. I believe macroeconomic conditions are likely to turn favorable for a bull market in the next couple of years amid the expected decline in inflation and interest rates.

BlackRock is not cheaply valued; at the moment, I'd argue it is fairly valued based on recent earnings and historical valuation levels. However, a great business such as BlackRock is highly likely to survive recessionary conditions to thrive in the next bull market. BlackRock is what I would call a wonderful company at a fair price with a long runway for growth.

Musk lost $14.5 billion in the week ending Friday, sending his net worth down 7% to $187.9 billion, by far the greatest slide on a gross and percentage basis this week among all billionaires. The tumble came as Tesla investors soured on the company‚Äôs profitability prospects as a quarterly report Sunday revealed vehicle inventory spiked early this year, but Musk remains by far the wealthiest person in the U.S. and second-richest man in the world. LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, holder of the illustrious world‚Äôs wealthiest crown with a $223.1 billion fortune, joined Musk as one of this week‚Äôs biggest losers, shedding $2.7 billion as shares of his luxury empire slipped. Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page headlined the week‚Äôs winners, as both Brin and Page‚Äôs respective fortunes grew by roughly $3.5 billion as shares of Google parent Alphabet soared 5%. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (up $2.2 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (up $1.4 billion) were also among the top gainers as shares of their respective companies climbed 3% and 2%.

Musk, who bought Twitter at a $44 billion valuation last year and subsequently became its CEO, had a particularly dramatic week at the helm of Twitter, axing the site‚Äôs old verification process, propping up the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin by featuring the token‚Äôs logo across Twitter and lashing out at NPR and the New York Times. Though Musk‚Äôs controversial ‚Äúantics‚Äù with Twitter dragged down Tesla‚Äôs share price last year, the electric vehicle giant‚Äôs latest slide is unrelated to the behavior of its leader, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. ‚ÄúTesla investors have now become immune to the Musk Twitter drama which remains background noise on the stock,‚Äù Ives wrote Wednesday in an email to Forbes.

Shares of Tesla are down 52% since April 4, 2022, the day Musk revealed he took a 9.2% stake in Twitter. That‚Äôs the largest decline of any company listed on the S&P 500 with a market capitalization over $15 billion, according to FactSet data. Musk‚Äôs net worth is down more than $100 billion since last April, while Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization sank from nearly $1.2 trillion to less than $600 billion.

Forbes knocked roughly $700 million off of its net worth calculation for former President Donald Trump this week, largely thanks to a heavy discounting in the estimated value of Trump‚Äôs stake in his social media company Truth Social. Trump is worth an estimated $2.5 billion, making him the 1,246th-richest person in the world.

The reusable containers, which are sold under the brand name Genesis Sterrad, are used by hospitals for storing surgical instruments before and after sterilization.

Tech tycoons have taken the brunt of the beating.

year ago, America‚Äôs technology billionaires were soaring, with markets near all-time highs and VCs pumping big money into startups. What a difference a year makes.

Stock prices have dropped and inflation has surged, making the members of The Forbes 400 list of the richest people in the U.S. a collective $500 billion poorer than last year. The wealthiest tech tycoons have taken the brunt of the beating: They have lost a combined $315 billion in net worth since the fall of 2021‚Äìaccounting for nearly two-thirds of the total drop in The Forbes 400‚Äôs wealth.

In all, there are 65 people who made their fortunes in technology on the 2022 list; 50 are poorer than they were in 2021.

The biggest losses have come from the biggest fortunes: Amazon shares are down 27%, taking $50 billion off Jeff Bezos‚Äô net worth and dropping him from the top spot on The Forbes 400 for the first time since 2018. Microsoft stock, down by 15%, helped lop $13.5 billion off the fortune of former CEO Steve Ballmer. No company illustrates the end of the pandemic boom more than video conferencing company Zoom, which is down 73% in the last year as workers return to the office‚Äìbad news for founder Eric Yuan, who‚Äôs down $10.6 billion.

Others in tech-adjacent fields were hit too. The $315 billion decline in wealth does not include, for example, the $76.8 billion drop in Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune due to a plummet in shares of Facebook-parent Meta. Forbes categorizes social media billionaires like Zuckerberg as part of the media & entertainment sector.

Here are the 10 tech billionaires who lost the most money this year, in dollar terms. Comparisons are between September 3, 2021 and September 2, 2022.

Bezos lost the title of richest person in America over the past year, prompting jeers from Elon Musk, who surpassed the Amazon founder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sending a giant statue of the digit ‚Äò2‚Äô to Jeffrey B.,‚Äù Musk wrote in a short email to Forbes in September 2021, when he took Bezos‚Äô spot, ‚Äúalong with a silver medal.‚Äù Nearly a year later, Musk still has the gold‚Äìby a margin of $100 billion.

Page and Sergey Brin, the elusive cofounders of the world‚Äôs most popular internet search engine, gave up operational control of Google and its parent, Alphabet, at the end of 2019. Shares are down 25% since last year‚Äôs list, helping cost Page‚Äìwho gained residency in New Zealand‚Äì$30 billion in net worth.

In addition to his Alphabet shares diving, the press feasted on reports that Brin filed to divorce his second wife in January after rumors of a brief affair with Elon Musk. She denied the allegations, as did the Tesla cofounder, who shared selfies of him and his friend Brin, who kept quiet.

The bad year for Microsoft stock hurt Gates‚Äô wallet, but most of his drop in net worth was self-inflicted: He donated $20 billion to his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in July in an effort to ramp up the mega-foundation‚Äôs giving.

Like Gates, Scott partially chose to shed much of her fortune. Her Amazon shares are worth less, but her charitable giving is costing her big. Since June last year, the ex-wife of Bezos has donated more than $4 billion to causes including Planned Parenthood and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

Shares of his database giant, Oracle, are down 17% since the 2021 list, as it struggled with the rest of the market. The company reportedly began laying off hundreds of employees, mostly in advertising, last month in a bid to focus on healthcare IT and its cloud business.

The eBay founder‚Äôs net worth took a dive after shares of PayPal, which was acquired by eBay and spun off in 2015, sank 69% in the last year. Forbes estimates that Omidyar, who is also one of the 25 most philanthropic billionaires, owns roughly 5% of the payments giant.

The animated former Microsoft CEO and LA Clippers owners saw his fortune plummet this year as shares of Microsoft fell 14%.

Workers are going back into the office, and video conference company Zoom is struggling. Its most recent quarterly earnings missed analysts‚Äô estimates and the company lowered its revenue guidance for 2023. The stock is down 73% in the last year.

            By Heather Burke, Bloomberg Markets Live analyst and reporter

Retail‚Äôs horrible 2022 is unlikely to get any better as the all-important holiday season unofficially kicks off this week amid an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis on both sides of the Atlantic.

Retail is one of the worst-performing S&P 500 GICS 2 sectors year-to-date, down more than 30% compared with the overall benchmark‚Äôs decline of about 17%. Some of that stems from the selloff in mega-tech: Amazon.com is approximately 45% of the gauge and responsible for about 75% of retail‚Äôs decline in terms of market cap.

But even minimizing Amazon with the equal-weight S&P Retail Select Industry Index (SPSIRE), down almost 30% year-to-date, underscores the sector‚Äôs underperformance.

US retail sales posted the biggest increase in eight months in October, but some discretionary categories like electronics declined, suggesting price cuts and weaker demand are weighing on the value of sales. Inflation, while slowing, remains firmly entrenched above pre-pandemic levels, meaning people are spending more on essentials like food and gas. Lower gasoline prices may help. But consumer sentiment is fragile amid rising borrowing costs. Some spending has also shifted from goods to experiences such as travel.

Retailers including Macy‚Äôs, Gap and Ross Stores rallied last week on strong earnings; for some, measures to clear inventory with big discounts paid off. But others said sales slowed in recent weeks and gave cautious outlooks. Ross said ‚Äúwe continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season.‚Äù Target tumbled post-results as shoppers were hit by ‚Äúinflation, rising interest rates and economic uncertainty,‚Äù the CEO said; discretionary categories have lagged.

And while Walmart boosted its forecast, part of that came from higher-income shoppers trading down, and a shift to groceries from general merchandise. Even Amazon is concerned, projecting the slowest holiday-quarter growth in its history.

The National Retail Federation forecasts sales rising by 6% to 8% in November and December, well below last year‚Äôs record 13.5% increase. Retailers may have to discount deeply to attract shoppers, threatening profitability at a peak period.

Black Friday, the informal start of the peak shopping season, comes this week amid the muted backdrop. A Goldman Sachs survey of 1,000 US consumers found that nearly half plan to spend less this holiday season than they did in 2021.

Retail stocks are also being battered in Europe and are among the most shorted. While the sector, like US peers, has benefited from the bear market rally, it‚Äôs still the second-worst performer in the Stoxx 600 year-to-date, with consumer confidence near a record low.

UK retail stocks have seen particular misery amid the sharpest drop in living standards. It‚Äôs one of the worst-performing FTSE 350 sectors so far this year. October‚Äôs retail sales were worse than expected.



Consumers face higher taxes and spending cuts as the government tries to tackle inflation and rein in the budget deficit. Disposable incomes will probably fall 7% in the next two years under last week‚Äôs measures set out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Retail has become a bit of a recovery play in the recent bear market rally and US consumers have shown resilience by some measures such as credit. But with multiple retail gauges set for the worst year since the global financial crisis, it will take a remarkably strong holiday season to overcome 2022‚Äôs gloom -- and next year may not be much better.

Coming into today, shares of the Mexican food chain had gained 0.84% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 0.74%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.05%.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Chipotle Mexican Grill as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Chipotle Mexican Grill to post earnings of $12.11 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 30.22%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.51 billion, up 13.59% from the prior-year quarter.

For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $43.90 per share and revenue of $9.84 billion, which would represent changes of +33.92% and +13.98%, respectively, from the prior year.

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Chipotle Mexican Grill. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Parents are angry that the strategy of sponsoring basketball camps or soccer training sessions backfiring, while parents are concerned that the gambling companies are using their children in a cynical ploy to win community support for a development that will prey on their neighbors. In Nassau County, Las Vegas Sands invited local children‚Äö√Ñ√¥s soccer teams to an event with soccer stars David Beckham and Carli Lloyd, but the kids wore their own team jerseys. Parents say that their kids do not know or care where the funding comes from, and free backpacks and water bottles from a clinic are difficult to turn down in a community where there are economic pressures and limited summer activities for children. Many states, including New York, are yet to regulate gambling companies from marketing to minors and the ban would encompass putting logos on clothing.","Casino bidders need to show community support, so they are outfitting local children in T-shirts with logos. Also, curbside composting comes to Brooklyn.",LVS,Services,Casinos & Gaming,Las Vegas Sands,2023-05-13T18:24:47+00:00,2023-05-13,2023-05-13T18:24:47+00:00,[{'name': 'Finance'}],"Financial institutions better known for their credit cards than bank accounts are seeing an influx of deposits as Americans seek higher returns on their savings.

During the first quarter of 2023, American Express saw deposits jump by 33% year over year, including inflows in the weeks following recent volatility in the banking sector. At the same time, Discover's deposits climbed a record 18%. Synchrony Financial ‚Äî the issuer behind many store credit cards ‚Äî also posted a 17% annual gain in deposits in the first quarter, while Capital One‚Äôs deposits increased 12%.

By contrast, Bank of America‚Äôs total deposits fell almost 8% year over year in the first three months of 2023, while Wells Fargo‚Äôs deposits fell 7% from the same quarter last year. CitiGroup‚Äôs deposits remained flat.

The move reflects the consumer‚Äôs desire to find higher-yielding deposit accounts, a trend that had been blossoming since last year and accelerated by the turmoil from the banking failures in March.

‚ÄúPeople are feeling more comfortable going to online-only banks to chase higher returns and I, myself, moved from a big mega bank to an online only bank and have been very happy with the returns on it,‚Äù Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, told Yahoo Finance.

As economic conditions remain volatile, some consumers are thinking carefully about where to put their money.

The big banks have been slow to up the yields on their savings accounts a year after the Federal Reserve embarked on its interest rate hike campaign to dull inflation. Credit card issuers, however, have been offering more attractive options that result in higher-yielding savings.

‚ÄúIt really does take something significant in order to get people to change their banks, because we don‚Äôt do that easily,‚Äù Schulz said. ‚ÄúIt really needs to be a significantly better return, better service, credit card offer, or interest rates to get people to move and right now it appears we‚Äôre seeing that.‚Äù

Another example is Apple Card‚Äôs new high-yield savings account, which drew in nearly $1 billion in deposits before the end of its launch week in April.

Apple‚Äôs new product offers daily rewards with a savings account from Goldman Sachs, at an annual percentage yield, or APY, of 4.15%. That‚Äôs a rate that‚Äôs more than 10 times the national average, according to Apple. The account itself includes no fees and no minimum deposits or balance requirements, the company said.

By contrast, Wells Fargo‚Äôs Way2Save savings account offers an APY of 0.15% on all balances and requires a $25 deposit to get started.

‚ÄúSo many people are living ‚Ä¶ on a tight budget and if you can double the amount of the amount of return that you're getting on your savings ‚Äî going from 2% to 4% or even if you just bring it up as a single percentage point, which you certainly may be able to do depending on your particular circumstances ‚Äî it's a significant thing,‚Äù Schulz said.

‚ÄúIt may not may not change your life, but it may expand your financial margin for error a little bit.""

1,good,True,positive,7509,"People look out from aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship, operated by Princess Cruises, as it maintains a holding pattern about 25 miles off the coast of San Francisco, California on March 8, 2020. 

Princess Cruises, a Carnival Corporation brand, is resuming trips in its homeport of Japan early next year, the company said in a press release on Friday.

Starting March 15, the Diamond Princess will take off from Tokyo for cruises ranging from five to 19 days, according to the press release. 

Japan joins a growing pool of countries warming back up to cruise tourism after hitting pause for Covid. 

Cruise companies have steadily been building back since the initial shutdown, but the rebound of the industry has been stunted by macroeconomic headwinds like rate hikes and a potential recession.","Princess Cruises will launch trips from Tokyo starting next year, after Japan lifted its ban on international cruises.",CCL,Transportation,Cruise Lines,Carnival Corp,2023-01-20T20:47:20+00:00,2023-01-20,2023-01-20T20:47:20+00:00,"[{'name': 'Business'}, {'name': 'Tech'}]","Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) on Friday became the latest technology giant to lay off thousands of workers ‚Äî a move we expected from the Club holding given falling advertising revenue and growing fears of a recession. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced the headcount reductions in an email to staff Friday, saying the firm plans to eliminate around 12,000 jobs , or 6% of its global workforce. Pichai said layoffs in the U.S. would begin immediately. ""I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here. Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today,"" Pichai wrote. Shares of Alphabet, which had plunged by nearly 39% in 2022, were up roughly 4% in midday trading, at $96.77 apiece. Alphabet's digital advertising business, from which it generates most of its revenue, has taken a hit as businesses rein in ad spending in a slowing economy. The company had reported a poor third quarter in late October, with YouTube ad revenue down and growth at Google search ads slowing. Like many Big Tech companies, Alphabet over hired during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic to meet burgeoning demand. Club holdings Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) have all recently shed headcount, squeezed by macroeconomic headwinds. Here's a breakdown of where things stand for the Club's other tech holdings. Amazon In early January, CEO Andy Jassy announced 18,000 job cuts at the ecommerce company. Amazon had hired roughly 300,000 workers during the pandemic, as demand for online shopping exploded. But when that demand receded last year, Amazon was left with unsustainable expenses. The Club view: Amazon did not go far enough in its cost-cutting efforts. If it were to further reduce its workforce, the stock could go higher. Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, is a growth engine for the company where management should put its focus. Shares of Amazon were up more than 3% Friday afternoon, at $96.51 apiece. Meta Platforms Meta in November announced it was letting go of 11,000 employees , or 13% of its workforce. CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the decision after the Facebook parent reported disappointing third-quarter results, along with mounting costs and expenses. Investors were particularly frustrated by Meta's heavy investment in the metaverse, sending the stock tumbling by nearly 25% after the earnings release in late October. The Club view: Meta's job cuts show that the company is working to better manage its costs, even if it is set to continue losing money in the metaverse. The company should rein in spending on the metaverse and put that money toward stock buybacks and its Reels video offering. Still, the company's fundamentals, including engagement on Facebook and Instagram, is holding up. Meta was trading up around 2.5% Friday, at $139.51 a share. Salesforce Earlier this month, Salesforce said it would cut 10% of its workforce , impacting more than 7,000 workers. The staff reductions are part of a cost-cutting plan to improve profitability amid slowing sales growth. The company had experienced massive growth during the pandemic, as businesses accelerated their digital transformation and cloud adoption. The Club view: Salesforce's layoffs accounted for underperforming employees in its sales business, an area where CEO Marc Benioff had concerns around productivity. If sales prove weaker than expected this year, more job cuts could be on the horizon. Salesforce was trading up around 3.25% Friday, at roughly $151.20 a share. Microsoft Microsoft on Wednesday said it was laying off 10,000 employees , nearly 5% of its workforce. The job cuts come as revenue growth is slowing. CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC in an interview earlier this month that he expects the next two years to be challenging for the tech industry. The Club view: Microsoft's job cuts were the right move, but we remain cautious on the stock and suspect more layoffs could be on the horizon. At the same time, we think the software giant still has long-term potential, with growth opportunities around artificial intelligence. Shares of Microsoft climbed more than 3.5% Friday afternoon, to $240.17 apiece. Bottom line Alphabet and other Big Tech players can't control the tough economic environment, but they can control how they manage expenses. The layoffs we've seen thus far are a good start. But while eliminating jobs is a step that can alleviate pressure on revenues, cutting their bloated workforces is only one aspect of the overall reductions in costs and expenses needed at these firms. All these companies are seeing their revenue growth slow after a pandemic pull-forward, and now they need to adjust their expenses to reflect this new reality. The mega caps are finally putting into motion the plans we have wanted them to enact for months, and the companies have been rewarded with higher stock prices. We've been concerned about the slowdown in sales, but the layoffs today will produce higher earnings in 2024, making the stocks actually cheaper than what they were at the start of the year. Regarding Alphabet, the Club will be looking to see whether Friday's layoffs extend to a pullback in capital expenditures when the company reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2.

What Is the GF Score?

The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.

Alphabet Inc's GF Score components are as follows:

Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis. Through backtesting, we know that each of these key aspects has a different impact on the stock price performance. Thus, they are weighted differently when calculating the total score. With high ranks in financial strength, profitability, and growth, and decent ranks in GF value and momentum, GuruFocus assigned Alphabet Inc the GF Score of 98 out of 100, which signals the highest outperformance potential.

Small businesses are a dynamic element in Portland and part of what makes the city unique. SmartAssets reports that approximately 24% of Multnomah County locals have small business incomes.

Nearly 60% of the Multnomah County small business owners who applied identify as a person of color, and 65% report being a female-owned company. This is notable, as small businesses, especially those owned by historically marginalized identities, were hit particularly hard during the pandemic. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research noted that Black-owned small businesses were hardest hit, suffering the steepest decline (41%), followed by Hispanic and Asian American-owned small businesses. In addition, according to a study by the National Association of Women Business Owners, women-owned businesses have been growing at only half the rate of those run by men, namely because women struggle to access capital and other resources to help them succeed. Comcast RISE stands for Representation, Investment, Strength and Empowerment. It was created in November 2020 to help small businesses hit hardest by COVID-19, from bakeries and barber shops to childcare centers and cleaning services, by providing the grants needed to survive and recover. The program has evolved from helping businesses survive the pandemic to helping businesses and their communities achieve stronger economic growth. Comcast RISE is part of Project UP, the company‚Äôs comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities. Since its inception, Comcast RISE has awarded more than $125 million in monetary, marketing and technology grants to small businesses in multiple cities across the U.S.

RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

""Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): Amazon was a top contributor in the second quarter, in reaction to a solid 1Q23 earnings report. The company generated $127 billion of revenue (2% ahead of expectations) and nearly $5 billion of operating income (57% better than expectations) driven by rebounding online sales and strong incremental gross margins. During the company‚Äôs earnings conference call, Amazon management pointed to easing inflationary pressures, higher productivity gains, and lower expected capital spending for the remainder of the year. The only negative in the quarter was slowing AWS revenue growth, which we believe will rebound later in the year. With its ability to continue its market share gains in three leading businesses (e-commerce, web services and online advertising), plus a multi-year operating margin expansion opportunity (from improved e-commerce margins and greater contribution from the faster growing, higher margin AWS and advertising segments), we believe Amazon remains one of the best-positioned global growth companies in the world. AMZN shares trade at a 10-year trough EPS multiple, despite what we believe to be currently depressed margins and earnings.""

‚Ä¢ None The chart of the day

It seems almost every tech story these days is about the power, possibility, and danger of artificial intelligence.

And while the potential of AI often seems boundless in the way its biggest boosters present, the near-term business implications of AI are actually focused on one of tech's most entrenched and profitable products ‚Äî search.

Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOG) saw shares fall nearly 3% on Monday after a New York Times report on Sunday said Samsung has weighed replacing Google Search with Microsoft's Bing (MSFT) on its devices.

The Times noted this deal put some $3 billion in annual revenue at risk for Google and reported a similar deal with Apple ‚Äî worth closer to $20 billion ‚Äî is up this year. Google's Search revenue totaled $162.5 billion in 2022.

Reports suggesting 12% of a business's revenue is at risk rarely sit well with investors. Even if these deals are extended, the subtext is that renewals may come with terms more favorable to the device makers.

That Google's future profits from search might decline, of course, is not entirely new to investors. Two months ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella plainly stated this was going to be the industry's future.

""From now on, the [gross margin] of search is going to drop forever,"" Nadella said in an interview with the Financial Times in early February. Nadella added: ""There is such margin in search, which for us is incremental. For Google it's not, they have to defend it all.""

But the challenge to Google's Search business is only superficially taking place at the negotiating table. The bigger, more technical challenge is coming from AI.

According to the Times' report, ""the assumption inside Google"" is that Microsoft's progress on new AI-powered search features is ""the main reason"" Samsung has considered changing its search partner. Microsoft's Bing is powered by Open AI after Microsoft invested $10 billion in the company back in January.

A report from ""60 Minutes"" which aired Sunday showed Google's Bard chatbot ‚Äî which is the company's answer to Open AI's ChatGPT ‚Äî offer summaries for five books. Unfortunately, none of them were real.

One assumes the executive team at Samsung has seen this report as well.

But turning ""Googling"" into ""Binging"" will take more than offering favorable revenue sharing agreements, new software upgrades, or corporate investments.

In the modern tech order, the strongest moat any company or service can build is to become a verb. When people talk about looking up information on their computer or phone, in most cases they don't say they're searching ‚Äî they're Googling. Google's vice grip on the search market has centered on this branding.

Threats to Google's search dominance, of course, aren't unique to 2023. The magic of the industry's hottest social network ‚Äî TikTok ‚Äî is that search is largely replaced with discovery. Search is also at the heart of Amazon's online shopping portal, and Meta's Facebook and Instagram platforms. Every search query done by users on these platforms is a search not done on Google.

But when people talk about anything AI-related, they usually don't reference LLMs or AGI or Bard. Instead, they say ""ChatGPT.""

Whether AI turns out to be the paradigm-defining technology the tech world believes remains to be seen. But should this possible future come to pass, the earliest phase of this land grab has not been kind to Google.

The Department of Labor said on Thursday that the producer price index (PPI) rose by just 0.1 percent in June, half of what Wall Street was expecting. On a 12-month basis, the index is up only 0.1 percent. This was the twelfth straight month of decline for the index, which has come down from last June‚Äôs 11.3 percent year-over-year figure.

This came a day after the Labor Department said the year-over-year gain in the consumer price index had fallen to three percent, the lowest in over two years. As we expected, President Joe Biden took credit for the decline, calling it ‚ÄúBidenomics in action.‚Äù

And yet the labor market remains very tight. The unemployment rate in June was just 3.6 percent, and employers had 9.8 million open jobs at the end of May.

From the Fed: One and Done?

Wall Street‚Äôs reaction has been to significantly discount the chances of a second rate hike after the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting. (A hike at that meeting is assumed to be locked-in.) A week ago, the CME group‚Äôs Fed Watch tool indicated a 36 percent chance that we would end the year with a federal funds rate between 5.5 and 5.75 percent, 50 basis points higher than the current target range of five percent to 5.25 percent. By yesterday, the odds had dropped down to 21 percent. On Thursday, they were just 14 percent.

Yet there are reasons to believe that inflation might not be quite as dead as it looks from the headlines or the White House‚Äôs tweets. The prices of final demand goods in the producer price index were flat for the month after falling 1.6 percent in May. This may indicate that the benefit from supply chain repairs and a shift in spending away from goods has run its course.

The index for final demand services climbed 0.2 percent, matching the May gain. This too could be an indicator that inflation is getting stuck where it is rather the continuing to trend down.

The year-over-year headline numbers also benefit from the fact that the price surge in June of last year has finally dropped out of the calculation.

There was, however, good news on inflation further up the supply chain. Prices of processed goods for intermediate demand fell 0.6 percent, the fifth consecutive monthly drop. The decline was broad-based, with core processed goods‚Äîa measure that excludes food and energy prices‚Äîfalling 0.4 percent. For the 12 months ended in June, the index for processed goods for intermediate demand fell 9.4 percent, the largest 12-month decline since September 2009.

Margins moved up by 0.2 percent and remain well-above the pre-pandemic trend. It‚Äôs likely, however, that these will start to compress as businesses feel pressure to pass on some of the disinflation in intermediate demand goods.

According to Stephen Juneau of Bank of America, the PPI data that flow through to the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index the Fed uses for its two percent target were more inflationary than the prior month. By Juneau‚Äôs calculation, the PPI numbers imply a 0.2 percent month-to-month increase in core PCE inflation and 4.2 percent year-over-year. Headline PCE inflation will likely be up 0.2 percent for the month and three percent for the year.

While the decline in inflation is welcome news, especially given the ongoing strength in the labor market, many Americans may not feel much relief. Take the price of groceries. The consumer price index for ‚Äúfood at home‚Äù was flat in June. But over the past year, prices are up 4.7 percent, and over the past two-years they are up 16.9 percent. Prices of food away from home‚Äîdining out‚Äîare up 15.9 percent over the two-year window. As a result, American families are still experiencing sticker shock at meal times.

Disney‚Äôs long-time head honcho took over once again as CEO last week after Chapek‚Äôs ouster, and told employees Monday that the company will maintain its hiring freeze as it looks to rein in costs, according to several outlets. Iger also touted a noticeable pivot in the company‚Äôs growth focus for its Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu services, saying he intends to focus on profitability as opposed to subscriber numbers among the platforms ‚Äî notable considering Disney reported a $1.5 billion loss in its streaming unit last quarter. Disney bleeding money in streaming coincided with its shares‚Äô roughly 50% drop from its March 2021 peak, and Iger‚Äôs return comes amid several rumors of Disney‚Äôs next steps, including pursuing another major acquisition ‚Äî like Disney‚Äôs purchase of 21st Century Fox and Marvel Entertainment under Iger‚Äôs watch ‚Äî or potentially merging with the world‚Äôs most valuable company Apple.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer hit the wealthy with higher taxes on wages and dividends and extended a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, telling the House of Commons on Thursday that he was prioritizing ‚Äústability, growth, and public services.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe take difficult decisions to tackle inflation and keep mortgage rates down,‚Äù Hunt told lawmakers as he unveiled his Autumn Statement -- a budget in all but name. ‚ÄúBut our plan also leads to a shallower downturn; lower energy bills; higher long-term growth; and a stronger NHS and education system.‚Äù

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak‚Äôs government is pushing through the measures to restore confidence among investors in Britain‚Äôs ability to pay its way after a disastrous experiment with deep tax cuts by his predecessor, Liz Truss.

Hunt said the aim of his program is to get debt falling as a share of the economy by 2027-28, and to get public sector borrowing over the next five years below 3% of GDP.

The task is enormous, patching up the economic damage wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, the fallout from Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine, and the disastrous tenure of Sunak‚Äôs predecessor, Liz Truss and her Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, whose massive program of unfunded tax cuts sank the pound and roiled the bond markets.

Hunt -- brought in by Truss to replace Kwarteng and steady market nerves, and kept on by Sunak -- had already reversed the bulk of that plan before Thursday. While he said Kwarteng had been right to pursue growth, he added that ‚Äúunfunded tax cuts are as risky as unfunded spending.‚Äù

On growth, Hunt said he wanted to spur energy, infrastructure and innovation. The Treasury will work to boost renewable energy and efficiency programs. It‚Äôs also maintaining capital budgets for projects like the HS2 rail upgrade and other transport projects and setting aside more resources for research and development.

‚ÄúWe need to get better at turning world class innovation into world class companies,‚Äù Hunt said. ‚ÄúTurn Britain into the world‚Äôs next Silicon Valley.‚Äù

The Chancellor said the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government‚Äôs fiscal watchdog, now forecasts the British economy to shrink by 1.4% next year, a downgrade from the previous official outlook for 1.8% growth. He also lowered the prediction for 2024, blaming ‚Äúglobal headwinds,‚Äù primarily the rise in energy prices stoked by Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe want low taxes and sound money,‚Äù Hunt said. ‚ÄúBut sound money has to come first because inflation eats away at the pound in people‚Äôs pockets even more insidiously than taxes.‚Äù

Other measures outlined by Hunt included said the government will proceed with a new nuclear plant, Sizewell C, in eastern England and confirmed its commitment to the HS2 high-speed rail project and plans to build more hospitals and roll out super-high-speed broadband.

But he also said public spending will grow more slowly than the economy, and departmental budgets will have have real-term spending cuts. He said just over half of the package is made up of spending cuts, with just under half coming from tax rises.

It‚Äôs an important moment for the Conservative government, which trails the Labour opposition by about 20 points in the polls with just over 2 1/2 at most before the next general election.

The balance between tax rises and spending cuts is key. Public services have already been pared back for a decade under Tory austerity, and voters have little appetite for more.

Meanwhile, tax rises are anathema to Conservative philosophy, and Sunak‚Äôs defeat to Truss in this summer‚Äôs leadership contest was in a large part due to his record as Chancellor in putting the country on track to its highest tax burden in seven decades.

It has a long history of managing top brands, including the Fort Worth brand Dickie‚Äôs, which it bought in 2017; Vans; Timberland; The North Face; and most recently, through acquisition, the popular streetwear brand Supreme.

After a strong year of growth coming out of the pandemic, high inflation has taken its toll on the company‚Äôs financials. Revenue was down 1% year over year through the first half of this fiscal year, with solid growth at The North Face and other brands offset by declines at Vans and Dickies. As a result, the stock price was recently down 61% this year, presenting an excellent buying opportunity.

By fiscal 2027, management is targeting annualized revenue growth of up to 10%, along with faster growth in earnings per share ‚Äî in the mid to high single digits. How will management accomplish these targets? The company narrowed its brand portfolio from over 30 names to 12, targeting products in high demand, such as outdoor apparel, workwear and streetwear.

VF‚Äôs dividend recently yielded a fat 7%, and management plans to return about $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over the next five years. Long-term investors seeking income should give VF Corp. a closer look.

From R.W. in Palmer, Alaska: What does the term ‚Äúpriced for perfection‚Äù mean?

The Fool responds: It‚Äôs often used when referring to a seemingly overvalued stock. It suggests that investors have high expectations for the company, and that their enthusiastic buying has pushed the share price up to a high valuation. It also suggests some riskiness, because if the company makes any mistakes or there‚Äôs some bad news, the stock could take a big hit.

You might avoid such a scenario by favoring ‚Äúvalue investing‚Äù ‚Äî seeking healthy, growing companies whose stocks are priced considerably below what you see as their intrinsic value. That builds in a margin of safety, which can reduce your risk if the share price drops.

From P.T. in South Kensington, Md.: Are stock dividends really taxed twice?

The Fool responds: Usually, yes. Here‚Äôs how: Imagine that Buzzy‚Äôs Broccoli Beer reports $120 million in sales. After subtracting various expenses, it keeps $30 million, which is subject to taxation.

With its post-tax profits, Buzzy‚Äôs might build a new factory, buy more advertising, hire more employees, repurchase some of its shares of stock and/or pay dividends to shareholders, among other things.

Any dividends that Buzzy‚Äôs pays out are generally considered taxable income for shareholders. That‚Äôs how dividends can get taxed twice ‚Äî first the company is taxed on its income, and then after it pays shareholders, they are typically taxed on those payments, too.

Some prefer companies to build more value for shareholders without paying out dividends. For instance, companies might repurchase some shares. Doing so reduces the share count, boosting each remaining share‚Äôs stake in the company ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt generate taxable income. (Repurchasing shares is wasteful, though, when a stock is overpriced.)

There are many scammers out there, and they love to target senior citizens. The FBI‚Äôs most recent Elder Fraud Report noted that in 2021, more than 92,000 victims over 60 years old reported losing $1.7 billion to fraud ‚Äî that‚Äôs 74% more than in 2020. Victims lost $18,246, on average, and 3,133 people lost more than $100,000.

Common senior scams involve Social Security. You might, for example, receive an alarming phone call, email or text suggesting that you‚Äôre in trouble. It might say that your Social Security benefits are about to be canceled unless you take certain actions ‚Äî now. You might be pressured to give out personal information, such as your Social Security number, birthdate and/or financial account numbers. The scammers might demand that you pay some money immediately.

Any of those things should serve as a big red flag. Know that the Social Security Administration will never call you out of the blue, or threaten that you must pay money immediately. If there‚Äôs ever an issue, the SSA is likely to send you a letter ‚Äî or it might email or text you if you have opted in for such communications. It usually requests payments via online bill pay or Pay.gov or in person at one of its many offices. If you‚Äôre ever in doubt, just contact the SSA directly and ask.

You can proactively prevent being targeted for a Social Security scam by signing up for a ‚Äúmy Social Security‚Äù account at SSA.gov. Everyone should do so, even if they‚Äôre far from retirement. Once you do, you can check in any time and see the SSA‚Äôs record of your earnings and estimates of your benefits. You can also update your contact information and manage your benefits online. If you haven‚Äôt set up such an account, a scammer might set one up for you, aiming to collect your benefits.

From S.O., online: My dumbest investment? Well, it was my first-ever stock investment ‚Äî a single share of Amazon.com that I bought for $303. I sold it three months later for $334 and thought I had made a good trade. Lesson learned: Play the long game!

The Fool responds: Looking at Amazon‚Äôs stock price now ‚Äî it was recently at $89 ‚Äî some might think that you dodged a bullet. But Amazon split its stock 20-for-1 in June. Shares were trading for around $2,450 pre-split, and if you owned one share then, you‚Äôd have ended up with 20 shares post-split, with each share worth around $122.50.

You probably bought your share long before the split, when the stock was on its way up to $2,450. Hindsight is 20/20, and it‚Äôs easy to regret selling the share, but if at the time you didn‚Äôt have confidence in Amazon‚Äôs potential to grow bigger, selling was the right move.

It can be tempting to sell a stock after it rises a bit and offers a profit, but always do a little research to see whether it seems likely to keep growing over many years.

But while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella seems to be in the lead following its major investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, other companies may be playing the long game.

In the course of a few months, artificial intelligence has catapulted from the realm of research labs into the public domain. ChatGPT arrived in November and last month hit 100 million users, while Google and Microsoft have made a flurry of product announcements in recent weeks and are expected to launch their own A.I.-enhanced chatbots soon.

Nadella himself referred to the A.I. competition with Google as a ‚Äúrace‚Äù when he announced Microsoft‚Äôs A.I.-assisted version of its Bing search engine earlier this month. But with such a lucrative market on the line, don‚Äôt expect only two factions in the coming war.

‚ÄúThis is an A.I. arms race that‚Äôs happening,‚Äù senior tech analyst at Wedbush Dan Ives said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday. ‚ÄúObviously, this race is just starting.‚Äù

Ives said Microsoft is ‚Äútop of the mountain‚Äù at the moment when it comes to A.I. after the company‚Äôs $10 billion investment in OpenAI, but warned that most other major tech companies are working on their own A.I. game plans.

‚ÄúYou look at what‚Äôs happened: It‚Äôs a Game of Thrones battle between Microsoft and Google, and Apple that‚Äôs just quietly sitting there right now,‚Äù Ives said, adding that he expects Apple to make some ‚Äúsignificant A.I. announcements‚Äù as early as this summer.

While Google, Microsoft, and even Chinese search engine Baidu are battling it out for A.I. on the search engine front, Apple may be working on a different strategy. Ives predicted Apple will ‚Äúintegrate A.I. more into the App Store and more into the actual devices,‚Äù and expects the next generation of Apple iPhones to come equipped with greater A.I. capabilities.

Apple is unlikely to be involved in the A.I. search engine wars directly, as the company receives billions of dollars annually from Google to keep it as the default search engine on the iPhone, but could still be poised to benefit regardless of who wins between Google and Microsoft. Both companies could engage in a bidding war for their search engines to be placed on Apple devices if their A.I.-enhanced technology performs comparably.

Earlier this month, Nadella told The Verge that increasing Bing‚Äôs user base is Microsoft‚Äôs goal, as even marginal gains in search engine market share from Google could translate into billions in extra advertising revenue.

Amazon is another company likely evaluating the situation and the Google-Microsoft A.I. war, Ives said. Like Apple, the e-commerce giant is unlikely to be directly involved in A.I. applications for search engines, but the company has recently explored integrating generative A.I. similar to the technology powering ChatGPT with its web services division, Amazon‚Äôs on-demand cloud computing and API platform.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in an interview with the FT this week that the company is exploring ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù to partner with smaller A.I. startups competing with OpenAI, without elaborating on how A.I. would enhance its web services platform, which primarily sells to companies.

In his CNBC interview, Ives predicted Amazon would use A.I. to enhance its business and sales operations to other companies. ‚ÄúI could see them specifically navigating on the enterprise,‚Äù he said. This week, Amazon Web Services announced a new partnership with Sway AI, a startup focused on creating accessible A.I. applications for businesses.

What it all adds up to is an A.I. arms race that extends far beyond search engines, and Ives said interest in A.I. is unlikely to be a passing fad.

‚ÄúThis is just starting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt view this as a ‚Äòhype cycle.‚Äô This is real spending, and I think that‚Äôs the difference versus other, we‚Äôll call them hype cycles that we‚Äôve seen over the past few years.‚Äù

The Club followed through on what Jim Cramer laid out last Sunday, using this week's volatility to opportunistically buy on market pullbacks. In fits and starts, bank stocks were under pressure all week. Our financials Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were not immune to the selling. We took no action on either this week. However, with our trusted S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator signaling an oversold market, we did find things to buy every day ‚Äî high-quality names that are right for the current economic climate. With so many trades, nine to be exact, here's a recap for Club members that further explains how our broader view of the market influences our buying decisions. Monday Monday was our busiest day . Before the bell, we decided to put some of our big cash position to work by making three separate trades in luxury beauty brand Estee Lauder (EL), cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and oil name Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Early in the session, we bought 30 shares of EL following a strong earnings call from Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which reported double-digit growth in its prestige skincare lineup, accelerating growth in makeup and a solid quarter in fragrances. We viewed the Ulta results as a positive read-through to Estee Lauder, which has similar in-demand products. We added 25 shares to our PANW position. We were pleased with the tech firm's strong fiscal second-quarter earnings beat in late February, specifically booking GAAP profitability over the last four quarters. This achievement makes the company eligible for inclusion in the S & P 500. Two spots opened up when SVB and Signature collapsed. While neither went to Palo Alto, we think it's only a matter of time before PANW is added to the index. We also added 25 shares of PXD following a decline in the energy markets. We had previously trimmed our position . But we like Pioneer for its strong annual dividend yield and its ability to still generate strong free cash flow in a weaker environment flow due to low break-evens of $39 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude, which went on to finish the week around $66 per barrel. Tuesday We again took advantage of Tuesday's down market early and scooped up shares of construction and manufacturing giant Caterpillar (CAT) after the opening bell. (However, by the close, Wall Street had a major reversal to the upside.) We added 30 shares of CAT to our portfolio, incrementally buying with discipline. It was an opportune market buy with shares of CAT down sharply over the past month. While Wall Street has expressed concerns over the possibility of a slower backlog, we're sticking with the company because it's well-positioned to be a key beneficiary of the U.S. government's massive spending package on infrastructure. Wednesday On Wednesday, the decline in stocks continued. So, we put more cash to work in two Club holdings. Shortly after the opening bell, we bought 75 shares of TJX Companies (TJX). The off-price retailer, which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods is likely to be the shopping destination of choice if the economy continues to slow down and consumer budgets tighten up. For a second day in a row , we scaled into our position in Caterpillar, buying an additional 20 shares, bringing our total CAT position to 310 shares. Over the long run we see strength in the manufacturing behemoth and saw Wednesday's sell-off, which was sparked by concerns over the health of Swiss bank, Credit Suisse (CS), as unrelated to the strong fundamentals in CAT. Thursday Despite Tuesday's bounce, the market continued to be oversold Thursday, signaling a buying opportunity in one of our chipmakers. (Wall Street closed Thursday sharply higher) We bought 50 shares of Qualcomm (QCOM). While we trimmed our position in the stock once in January and twice in February , we see the company's smartphone inventory issues improving and continue to be attracted to its 2.65% annual dividend yield. That's why we saw Thursday's volatile session as a chance to scale into our position and upgrade our rating on QCOM stock to a 1. Friday The week's sell-off resumed on the final trading day of the week, allowing us to make two incremental purchases : one industrial and one energy holding. We bought 50 shares of Emerson Electric (EMR). While we viewed Emerson's hostile takeover (now friendly) attempt of National Instruments (NATI) as unfavorable, NATI may need to take Emerson's $53-per-share offer since no second bidder has emerged. We see EMR's market decline after the takeover news as overblown and view the stock's valuation as more attractive following a steeper decline Friday. We made another buy of 130 shares of Halliburton (HAL) after shares of the company shed 13% this week as oil prices dropped. While the current environment doesn't incentivize producers to drill as crude prices dropped, we still think the industry has underinvested, and producers in business will continue to use Halliburton's technology.

Coming into today, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had lost 5.63% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 0.4%, while the S&P 500 gained 8.32%.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 14, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.45, unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $9.98 billion, up 5.44% from the year-ago period.

Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, or 35 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recovered intraday losses to trade flat after reporting quarterly results that beat on the top line, led by surprise strength in its cloud business, though revenue missed estimates and the company flagged a weaker outlook ahead.

Some on Wall Street, however, believe Microsoft‚Äôs cloud growth could reaccelerate sooner than expected, and the firm‚Äôs recent efforts to cut costs will begin to boost growth as soon as the fiscal fourth quarter.

‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs expense efficiencies, meanwhile, will start to bear fruit in 4Q with continued tailwinds into FY24, we believe earnings and revenue growth could have troughed in F2Q23 followed by stability and potential re-acceleration towards the end of CY23, which is why we reaffirm our Buy rating and $315 PT,‚Äù Goldman Sachs said.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), however, added to losses from a day earlier, falling 3% after the tech giant cut another 1,800 jobs in California on Wednesday.

Semiconductor stocks, meanwhile, were kept in the red by a 1% fall in chip bellwether Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) after the chipmaker misses quarterly revenue estimates, and guidance on earnings fell short of analysts‚Äô estimates.

‚ÄúTXN confirmed that all segments (ex-auto) were weak in 4Q and were expected to weaken further in 1Q as customers reduce inventory,‚Äù Credit Suisse said in a note. ‚Äú[P]otential incremental margin headwinds keeps us on the sideline as we await more detail from next week‚Äôs call,‚Äù it added.

Financials were also a source of support for the broader market‚Äôs move off session lows as sentiment on regional banks was boosted by a surge in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) on better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was also in the ascendency, up more than 7%, shrugging off quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates.

In other earnings news, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) delivered quarterly results that beat on the bottom line as the telecommunications company racked up more wireless subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter.

In other news, Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch withdrew a proposal to merge Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS), sending both shares 4% and 2% higher, respectively.

As expected, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday hiked its benchmark interest rate by 25 bps and gave an indication that more rate hikes are in the cards as inflation remains high. However, as inflation is showing signs of cooling, future rate hikes are likely to be smaller in magnitude. The latest hike takes rates to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007. The move also marked the eighth increase in rates since March 2022.

The last week was marked with key tech earnings. Among these, Apple Inc. AAPL reported dismal first-quarter fiscal 2023 results as it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the first time since 2016. The tech giant posted its largest year-over-year quarterly revenue decline since 2019 (read: ETFs in Focus on Apple's First Earnings Miss Since 2016).

After the closing bell on Thursday, Amazon AMZN disappointed investors following its fourth-quarter results. Though the e-commerce giant beat earnings and revenue estimates, it posted the least profitable holiday quarter since 2014 and the biggest-ever annual loss as a public company (read: ETFs in Focus Posts Amazon's Biggest Annual Loss Ever).

After the closing bell on Feb 1, Facebook‚Äôs parent company Meta Platforms META reported solid fourth-quarter 2022 results, which outpaced revenue and earnings estimates. Though the social media giant reported its third consecutive quarterly drop in revenues, it provided an upbeat revenue forecast, signaling a rebound in demand for digital ads after months of weak sales.

In terms of economic data points, ISM manufacturing data came in weaker. The ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.4 in January, the lowest since May 2020 at the height of the covid pandemic and below market forecasts of 48. The reading pointed to the third successive contraction in factory activity as companies slowed outputs to better match demand in the first half of 2023 and prepare for growth in the second half of the year.

Against this backdrop, below, we highlight a few inverse/leveraged ETF areas that won last week.

Oil and gas prices were under pressure following a set of bearish news coming out of the United States last week. A much smaller-than-usual inventory draw and forecasts of warmer weather in the United States till mid-Februarycaused natural gas prices to fall. An oilprice.com article also indicated that activists attacked Shell for Greenwashing.

Meta Platforms META reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $3 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 41.51%. Revenues of $32.17 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.74%. This caused a shoot-up in Meta shares last week. Meta gained a whopping 26.9% last week. Zuckerberg gained a record $12.5 billion in a day as Meta bounced back.

Although U.S. retail sales for the month of December came in downbeat, a less-hawkish Fed and a decline in rates as well as energy prices this year went in favor of retail stocks and ETFs. This is because both factors are likely to boost consumers‚Äô savings and their ability to shell out more on discretionary items.

Mainland China share market gained as investors chose to book profit after China's stock benchmark soared 7.4% last month on China‚Äôs economic reopening.

The benchmark U.S. treasury yield started the week at 3.55% and ended the week at 3.53%. The three-month U.S. treasury yield started the week at 4.72% and ended the week at 4.70%. This has steepened the yield curve a bit. A less hawkish Fed has resulted in this trend. This is a winning scenario for bank stocks as a steepening yield curve increased banks‚Äô net interest margin.

Market is not overbought yet U.S. stocks rose Thursday, led by the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite , which has outperformed the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all year long. Club holdings Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) helped fuel the gains. The market hasn't quite entered overbought territory yet, but that may happen if the broader rally persists. ""As we get overbought, I want [Club members] to be more careful,"" Jim Cramer said. Before the market open, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims in the week ended June 3 totaled 261,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, well above the Dow Jones estimate of 235,000. 2. Wait on Wynn Jim said he's not ready to pound the table on Wynn Resorts (WYNN) just yet. The casino operator fell more than 1% on Tuesday after Jefferies downgraded the stock to hold from buy and reduced its price target to $114 per share from $135. Jim said he recognizes that China's post-Covid recovery hasn't lived up to expectations, carrying implications for Wynn's business in Macao, a special administrative region of China. However, Jim said he sees continued strength in Wynn's Las Vegas operations. 3. Own Amazon for margins Research analysts at competing Wall Street firms published fresh research on Amazon, with different focuses in the notes. Wells Fargo expressed optimism around the tech giant's ability to expand margins in its crucial North American business, while UBS touted a reacceleration of AWS revenue growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Both firms have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon stock. While we also believe an artificial intelligence-powered AWS reacceleration looms , Jim said he's partial to Wells Fargo's emphasis on margins. ""That is the call,"" he said.

With nearly half of the Nasdaq 100 firms having reported, executives are less frequently using words like headwinds, inflation, and recession in calls with analysts and investors, according to a Bloomberg analysis. That marks a sharp reversal from last year, when such concerns drove steep equity declines.

While the C Suite is talking less about potential risks, mentions of artificial intelligence show no sign of slowing. Executives are scrambling to elaborate on how they plan to monetize new AI products and services ‚Äî be it up-selling software or manufacturing hardware to power servers and cloud infrastructures. Even the term metaverse has made a comeback.

‚ÄúCollectively, this is a positive signal with respect to business prospects and profitability, a reference to how the economy remains reasonably resilient,‚Äù said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ‚ÄúSince comments in conference calls tend to be forward-looking, this could suggest more improvement in earnings is ahead.‚Äù

With about 40 Nasdaq 100 companies having reported, here are some trends that have emerged in executive calls with analysts and investors:

References to recession and related terms like economic slowdown are down more than 70% this quarter in earnings calls compared to a year ago, with only 21 references as of Thursday. The usage is poised to decline for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on the companies that have reported this season.

Some forecasters are now casting doubt on whether the US economy will slide into a recession after all. This view received some major validation this week from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said the US central bank‚Äôs staff economists are no longer forecasting one.

AI has been the buzzword of the year - its emergence has contributed to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index jumping 41% this year ‚Äî and mentions have more than quadrupled. Executives have dropped the term 390 times already this earnings season compared to 92 a year ago. AI poster-child Nvidia Corp. is still to report.

Big tech firms like Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. spent their conference calls telling investors about their AI pipeline and how much they are planning to invest in developing the new technology. Generally the reports have been greeted warmly by investors. Both Alphabet and Meta rallied after their results, though Microsoft fell.

With inflation cooling, companies have started using the term fewer times on calls. Even references to headwinds, which saw 70 mentions in the fourth quarter, slipped to 31.

The Fed has since early last year engaged in the most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s in an effort to curb inflation, which in 2022 hit a 40-year high. June‚Äôs consumer-price report showed inflation decelerating.

A familiar term is starting to make something of a comeback. The Facebook parent mentioned metaverse a dozen times in its conference call this week. With the company‚Äôs growth back on track, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg spoke about the project that had him re-brand his multi-billion dollar social media business.

Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ken Gawrelski, who upgraded his rating on the stock to overweight from equal-weight, noted that the company‚Äôs estimates are moving meaningfully higher despite heavy spending on its long-term metaverse vision.

The First Eagle Global Fund (SGENX ), with almost $47 billion in assets under management, reflects the teachings and principles of economist and professor Benjamin Graham , the father of value investing, and Buffett, Graham's most famous disciple ‚Äî disciplined investing, ample liquidity and diversification. For almost three decades, starting in 1979, the fund was run by another acolyte of value, Jean-Marie Eveillard. Since 2008, the fund's been run by Matthew McLennan, with Kimball Brooker coming on board a year or two later. Since 1979, First Eagle Global has returned more than 12% annually, even including the 5% load fee charged on the first $25,000 invested. The current annual expense ratio is 1.11%. A $10,000 investment in the fund in 1979 was worth about $1.62 million at the end of 2022, excluding sales charges, more than three times the return of the MSCI World Index, First Eagle says . SGENX ALL mountain First Eagle Global price Graham and David Dodd, his fellow Columbia Business School professor, quite literally write the book on security analysis, Brooker said in an interview. ""They were the original value investors who really were focused on how not to lose money and we're focused on a means of systematically tilting the odds in the favor of their investors,"" adds the First Eagle co-manager. The fund beat the market during 2022's market turmoil with a 6% loss, and is up about 4% this year. How to find value? The fund employs three main elements when it comes to security selection within the universe of global value, Brooker said. It first insists on finding durable businesses, Brooker said. The concept is similar to searching for the so-called ""wide moat"" around a business that Buffett has called the single, ""most important"" factor in judging a company's competitive advantage. ""To us, survival and persistence is is really the the key question. That's kind of our view of quality,"" Brooker said. One example is Swiss elevator company Schindler Holding , which is as dominant in the industry as Otis Worldwide. Another name First Eagle considers a durable business is Richemont , a Swiss luxury goods holding company that makes Cartier jewelry, Brooker said. Another stock outside the U.S. that First Eagle holds is Jardine Matheson , a Hong Kong-based conglomerate whose origins date back to the 19th century, and whose businesses include Mandarin Oriental hotels. Margin of safety The second piece of the puzzle is to find stocks with a margin safety, Brooker said. The margin of safety principle, popularized by Graham, implies that an investor only purchases securities when they sell at a discount ‚Äî significantly below their intrinsic value. ""What is interesting is that this discount that international markets trade at relative to U.S. markets is very wide,"" Brooker said. The third element is to minimize risks stemming from management-related issues or unethical behavior, Brooker said. Brooker joined First Eagle in 2009 around the time when Eveillard stepped down. With a B.A. from Yale University and an MBA from Harvard, Brooker previously worked as the chief investment officer of Corsair Capital, a private equity firm spun off from JPMorgan. Big cash One notable characteristic of the fund is that it holds a significant amount of cash ‚Äî 7.5% of the portfolio right now. ""It's our default position. When we're not able to find things that make sense to us, that meet our underwriting criteria, we'll wait in cash,"" Brooker said. ""We don't want to force the money to be put to work into things that don't fit."" Buffett, too, is known for his preference to hold large amounts of cash, comparing it to oxygen. Berkshire's cash hoard grew to nearly $130 billion at the end of 2022. Buffett said in his recent annual shareholder letter that Berkshire will continue to hold a ""boatload"" of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with its myriad of businesses. Deep roots Within First Eagle Global's portfolio, which is half U.S. and half international stocks, there's a degree of overlap in a handful of companies that Berkshire Hathaway also owns, including American Express , Taiwan Semiconductor and Bank of New York Mellon . The fund has also owned shares in Berkshire itself for decades. ""It's probably not too surprising that like-minded investors often end up in in some of the same places,"" Brooker said. The connection to Berkshire doesn't end there. Eveillard, who served as First Eagle's senior advisor for years after surrendering day-to-day management, also taught at Columbia Business School's value investing program, where Buffett got an A+ from Ben Graham in 1951. ""The roots of value tribe are pretty deep here,"" Brooker said.",This half-century old fund seeks out global value and has Warren Buffett's style all over it,non-causal,"MSCI, MBA, ALL","['NPD', 'S', 'U']","['S', 'U']","['MSCI', 'ALL', 'MBA']","['MSCI', 'U', 'NPD', 'S', 'MBA', 'TSN', 'ALL']",-0.9995166

But the sky‚Äôs the limit for A.I.‚Äôs potential applications as companies and investors pour billions into the technology, and Amazon is the latest tech giant to throw its hat into the A.I. ring.

Last year‚Äôs successful launch of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, which became the fastest-growing app in history when it hit 100 million users in only two months, showcased the technology‚Äôs lucrative potential and spurred companies into action. In addition to Google and Microsoft, Meta, Twitter, and Salesforce have all announced investments in generative A.I., even as the same companies choose to cut back on expenses and employees elsewhere.

Not one to be left out, e-commerce giant Amazon is poised to make its own big A.I. play, CEO Andy Jassy announced in a letter to shareholders Thursday, launching its own in-house A.I. model known as Titan as well as big updates to enhance the company‚Äôs cloud services, an area in which Amazon is already a world leader.

Generative A.I. and the large language models (LLMs) that power it are ‚Äúcore to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our business for many decades to come,‚Äù Jassy wrote in the letter. The company is developing its own LLMs‚Äîdeep learning algorithms trained on troves of data to predict and generate words or images based on an input‚Äîto enhance Amazon Web Services (AWS), a pay-as-you-go cloud computing platform where companies pick and choose the services they want. Users can tap A.I. tools to simplify their AWS, while Amazon is also developing bespoke chips users can tap to craft their own LLMs to assist with operations.

Jassy said the company will continue to ‚Äúinvest substantially‚Äù in A.I. models across multiple services, including for consumers, sellers, brands, and creators, adding that the technology would ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãtransform and improve virtually every customer experience.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative A.I. as I think they will be that transformative, but I‚Äôll leave that for a future letter. Let‚Äôs just say that LLMs and Generative A.I. are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon,‚Äù he said.

Amazon executives went into more detail Thursday as to how the company was set to integrate A.I. with its services. Amazon also introduced Bedrock, a new service that allows AWS users to tap well-known A.I. models including from generative A.I. developer Anthropic and the text-to-image generator Stability AI. Amazon is also launching its own LLM, Titan, which can perform functions similar to ChatGPT and act like a virtual office tool.

While Amazon already has its own patented A.I. projects‚Äîsuch as CodeWhisperer, an A.I.-powered code generator‚Äîits take on the A.I. race is different from the more cutthroat stance of other tech companies, who have invested billions in their own projects and A.I. startups to gain a proprietary edge over competitors. With services like Bedrock, Amazon is looking to become a ‚Äúneutral platform,‚Äù according to a Wall Street Journal report Thursday, where companies who want to integrate their business with A.I. can come and pick what suits them best.

‚ÄúWe believe that customers are going to need a lot of different generative A.I. models for different purposes, and it is unlikely that any one model is going to serve all customers or even all the needs of one customer,‚Äù Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, told the Journal.

Jassy explained the neutral platform concept further in an interview with CNBC Thursday, where he said that Bedrock could fill an important niche by allowing companies to access ready-made and proven A.I. models without having to develop their own.

‚ÄúMost companies want to use these large language models, but the really good ones take billions of dollars to train and many years, and most companies don‚Äôt want to go through that,‚Äù he said.

But while Amazon‚Äôs approach to the A.I. race may be tamer than the at-times fast and furious one being employed at Google and Microsoft, the e-commerce giant still has a major stake in getting A.I. right if it wants to maintain a lead in cloud services. AWS is Amazon‚Äôs biggest source of revenue by a large margin, accounting for 14% of the company‚Äôs total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the subsidiary‚Äôs growth outpacing that of its parent company.

AWS remains well ahead of competitors Microsoft and Google in the cloud services department, but that lead is starting to shrink. AWS‚Äôs market share fell from 40.8% in 2020 to 38.9% in 2021, according to the most recent data from Gartner, a tech sector research firm, while Google and Microsoft clawed back some of the difference. Microsoft, which is developing new A.I. technologies with OpenAI to improve its own cloud services platform, Azure, is Amazon‚Äôs closest competitor, with its market share growing from 19.7% to 21.1% over the same period.

Beyond the impact to human lives, storms of this nature also turn into economic events as people, towns and cities rebuild after extensive damage. Wells Fargo said Wednesday that retail names exposed to the housing theme could see a ""possible uptick in 2H Home Improvement demand."" Analysts led by Zachary Fadem said that these companies, including those in the flooring and auto part industries, tend to benefit from hurricane preparation and clean-up activity. Fadem pointed specifically to Home Depot , Lowe's , O'Reilly Automotive and Floor & Decor Holdings as being among the possible beneficiaries. He has an overweight rating on all four stocks. Fadem added that even beyond the possible uptick in sales from the storm, defensive positioning is warranted across hardline retailers. Wells Fargo said that the storm could contribute between 30 and 80 basis points of incremental quarterly comparisons across its home improvement coverage in Florida alone. When including neighboring states such as Georgia and the Carolinas, the firm said total uplift could be between 90 and 130 basis points. Of course, much depends on the scale and scope of the storm. Wells Fargo noted that the benefits to Floor & Decor Holdings, for example, depends on the extent of water damages. When it comes to auto companies, Fadem said any potential benefits will likely be seen after the storm as consumers repair and replace damaged vehicles. Uptick in sales around storms also come with headwinds, however. Wells Fargo said that while comparisons can be attractive quarter over quarter or year over year, it doesn't necessarily mean higher margins. That's partly due to storm-related items such as lumber and generators carrying lower product margins. Additionally, store closures and elevated transportation costs can offset some of the benefits of a sales spike. ""For broader Home Improvement, we caution that Ian (and other storms) could also disrupt the supply chain, driving more inflation for building material products (which would be disappointing considering recent moderation in supply chain/domestic freight pressures),"" the firm said. Reinsurers Reinsurance companies are another area of the market that comes into focus amid catastrophic weather events, with names like Arch Capital , Axis Capital , Everest Re and RenaissanceRe attracting attention. Still, Bank of America noted Tuesday that it's premature to estimate losses from Hurricane Ian and the ultimate impact on the reinsurance market. The firm said that storms can become ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" events since short investors can suddenly reverse trades. ""Additionally, some investors short these offshore stocks at the beginning of hurricane season, hoping to be able to buy them back cheaper on the other side of it, which often creates a surge in buyers over sellers through the month of October,"" Bank of America analysts led by Joshua Shanker said in a note. - CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.","Home improvement companies could see increased sales following Hurricane Ian, Wells Fargo says",causal,CNBC,"['S', 'N', 'U']","['S', 'U']",['CNBC'],"['APH', 'N', 'CNBC', 'U', 'S']",-0.3781179

Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.74, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72. The bottom line, however, declined 45.1% year over year.



TROW's net revenues were adversely impacted by the decline in assets under management (AUM) and investment advisory fees. Also, the company recorded a rise in expenses during the quarter. Nonetheless, appreciation in cash and cash equivalent will help the company to continue investing.



Net income attributable to T. Rowe Price was $266 million, down 64.1% from the prior-year quarter.



In 2022, adjusted earnings of $8.02 per share beat the consensus estimate of $7.98 but declined 37.1% year over year. Net income attributable to T. Rowe Price was $1.56 billion, plunging 49.5%.

Net revenues in the fourth quarter decreased 22.3% to $1.52 billion from the year-ago quarter. The decline was mainly due to a fall in investment advisory fees. The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 billion.



In 2022, net revenues were $6.49 billion, down 15.4% year over year. The top line, however, marginally beat the consensus estimate of $6.48 billion.



Investment advisory fees fell 24.4% to $1.37 billion. Administrative, distribution and servicing fees decreased 14.9% to $129.4 million.



Total operating expenses increased 15.6% to $1.27 billion in the reported quarter.



As of Dec 31, 2022, T. Rowe Price employed 7,868 associates, up 4.5% from the end of 2021.

As of Dec 31, 2022, total AUM declined 24.5% year over year to $1.27 trillion. In the December-end quarter, net market depreciation and net distributions not reinvested of $61.8 billion, and net cash outflow of $17.1 billion reduced TROW‚Äôs AUM.



T. Rowe Price had substantial liquidity, including cash and cash equivalent of $1.76 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, up from $1.52 billion as of Dec 31, 2021. This will enable TROW to keep investing.

In the reported quarter, T. Rowe Price repurchased 1 million shares of its common stock for $111.3 million.

A challenging operating backdrop and geopolitical concerns have affected TROW‚Äôs AUM in recent months. Going forward, the increased dependence on investment advisory fees is concerning, as market fluctuations and a sudden slowdown in overall business activities could hurt this revenue source. However, a diversified business model, focus on enhancing investment capabilities, broadening distribution reach and improving client partnerships will aid long-term growth.

In a Tuesday research note, CLSA analysts led by managing director Elinor Leung noted the emergence of a ""global AI race with lucrative potential"" that has yet to fully play out in China. The U.S. has so far been the dominant market for AI. The explosion of investor excitement over AI in the U.S. has been driven by the likes of chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft , with the latter benefiting from an investment in ChatGPT-developer OpenAI. Google-parent Alphabet quickly followed suit with its own large-language model, Bard. Enthusiasm over AI propelled Wall Street throughout the first half of the year, and helped push Nvidia to a $1 trillion market capitalization . But the tide could soon shift, according to Leung. ""While the USA is a strong leader, China is putting up a fight and we believe it will become the world's second-largest AI market with over 6% share of global US$1tn AI spending by 2026,"" the note said. For exposure to the future AI growth in China, Leung highlighted Baidu and Alibaba , while calling out Tencent as the premier play ‚Äî a trio of stocks the firm dubbed ""BAT."" Shares of Baidu and Alibaba trade in the U.S. as American depository receipts, while Tencent primarily trades in Hong Kong.

""The three internet giants possess real-time search data and proprietary ecosystem data, as well as leading and cost-competitive cloud infrastructure and technology with self-developed chips,"" she said. BABA YTD mountain Alibaba stock has added 7.4% from the start of the year. Tencent is a standout, given that the company could stand to benefit the most from China's recovery from macro-driven headwinds which will delay information technology [IT] spending, Leung added.

Torn when the time came to search for a job, the economics major first consulted a mentor who connected him with a former student. That connection led the Maine native to T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. Since joining investment management firm in 2000, Allen's worked his way up the corporate ladder, taking the helm as portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Science & Technology (PRSCX) fund in 2009. The growth fund launched in 1987 aims to capitalize on innovation. In the wake of the latest artificial intelligence boom that's driven up last year's beaten-up technology stocks, it's skyrocketed nearly 38% in 2023. Longer-term, the fund, with a 0.84% expense ratio, offers 10- and 15-year trailing returns of more than 16% and about 13%, respectively. PRSCX YTD mountain PRSCX shares in 2023 Key to Allen's strategy since he began running the more than $7-billion fund is finding stocks he views as undervalued, hinging his investment framework around an analysis of cash flows. Allen also views solid, independent research as critical pieces of his methodology. This year, Allen has benefited from a spectacular run-up in technology stocks, fueled by a mania for all things tied to artificial intelligence. That said, ""I try to stay really disciplined around valuation,"" Allen maintains. ""I think especially in tech investing, valuation tends to get ignored or largely ignored."" Betting on FAANG stocks PRSCX owns all the major FAANG names (Meta, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet), except for Netflix, and dominant chipmakers benefiting from AI such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices , up 189% and 70%, respectively, this year. Other key holdings include Microsoft , Salesforce and German online retailer Zalando. Just two stocks combined ‚Äî Microsoft and Alphabet ‚Äî made up nearly a fifth of the fund's portfolio as of as of March 31. Both stocks have gained more than 38% this year as investors bet on the promise of AI and the pair battle to offer the best generative AI model. But the fund's favored Microsoft since 2008 and bought Alphabet last summer, long before their latest gains. Allen expects recent technology trends to continue boosting what he regards as high-quality names, and applies the same philosophy to a position in Amazon ‚Äî now the fund's fourth-largest holding. Allen stood by Microsoft even as a PC-fueled down cycle and uncertainty rocked the technology sector in 2022, driving down shares in the Xbox maker by about 29%. Allen opened his position in Alphabet last year, just as the slowing advertising cycle turned many investors away from the Google parent, dropping its multiple to the low teens. Allen viewed its solid fundamentals as unchanged. ""It's kind of unusual to get a great business at a lower PE than it's likely ...growth rate, and that's why I felt really comfortable having a particularly large position then in the stock,"" he explained. The same idea cemented Allen's faith in Salesforce last year, even as shares cratered 48%, its business slowed and the co-CEO announced his departure. The stock proved one of Allen's biggest losers in 2022, but the portfolio manager expects significant upside as IT spending improves. Salesforce has rebounded more than 58% this year. ""I looked at this company that I think is a top line grower, well into the double digits, with a ton of margin expansion, trading at 15 times free cash flow, and it just didn't make sense to me that a business this good would be this discounted,"" Allen said. Given his devotion to valuation, Allen has lately pulled back his exposure to some technology names that have rallied, significantly reducing stakes in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Advanced Micro Devices and Amazon. Unusual plays and new additions Not every name in Allen's portfolio is widely bought on Wall Street. Despite a recent selloff in Zalando , Allen said shares look ""really cheap"" and the company appears well-situated to take market share with its vast item selection. The stock, one of Allen's top 10 as of March 31, is undervalued by at least half on the basis of its long-term cash flow projections, and could potentially triple within the next few years, he calculates, he said. Accenture , which this week forecast weaker-than-estimated revenue in the current quarter , remains a ""premier"" technology services company able to guide businesses as they look to implement AI. It was Allen's 7th largest position at the end of March. Recent additions to the fund include Mastercard , Apple and Texas Instruments . While Mastercard lags the stock performance of many technology behemoths, Allen believes it offers similar growth potential, and less cyclicality and fewer risks. A low-risk approach also extends to Texas Instruments. While the analog semiconductor name is ahead less than 2% this year, Allen said it offers a strong track record of driving shareholder value and returning capital through buybacks and dividends. TXN yields 3%. Lately, the T. Rowe Price fund has outperformed even when it's slumped. The fund tumbled more than 35% during last year's rout, but other tech funds lost an average of 37.4%, according to Morningstar. For Allen, every investment and every cycle marks another learning opportunity to perfect his craft. ""It's really important to learn over time when things go well and especially when things don't go well,"" Allen said. ""One of the things that I focus on a lot, and have for the 23 years I've been doing this, is thoughtfully evaluating what I can do to just get incrementally better while sticking to a process that I believe in.""",Bets on A.I. and innovation help this tech-focused T.

Al Ansari Financial Services plans to double its dividend for 2023 ahead of its upcoming initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The United Arab Emirates-based money-exchange firm raised its target payout to a minimum of 600 million dirhams ($164 million), according to an investor presentation seen by Bloomberg. It plans to pay equal installments in October and April 2024 and is planning a payout of at least 70% of net profit after that, according to the document.

Al Ansari could list in Dubai as soon as the first quarter, Bloomberg reported in August. Preparations for the IPO are ongoing and details such as timing could still change. The Gulf region remains a bright spot for offerings with a strong pipeline of potential listings.

The company has drawn 300 million dirhams from Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC to pay a pre-IPO dividend, according to the presentation. It declared a 300 million dirham payout as well as a 1.076 billion extraordinary dividend for 2022.

Al Ansari expects its EBITDA margin to decrease slightly this year from 2022. In 2024, it expects the margin to be ‚Äúmeaningfully above 2022 levels,‚Äù according to the presentation. It paid 312 million dirhams in dividends in 2021 and 276 million dirhams in 2020.

Al Ansari Exchange was set up almost 60 years ago and currently has over 230 branches in the UAE, making it one of the largest exchange companies in the country.

With Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google launching the Pixel Fold at an event Wednesday, every major brand running the Android operating system has now adopted the form factor. And though Apple began early work on a foldable iPhone years ago, it‚Äôs shown little interest in racing a product to market.

The approach isn‚Äôt unusual for Apple, which often takes its time and then jumps into an established category with a more polished product. That was the case with the iPhone itself in 2007. The company also has less incentive to tinker with its current iPhone lineup since it dominates the market for premium smartphones.

But Apple could soon find itself years behind rivals in a promising segment. Though foldable phones are still a tiny fraction of the market, they command higher prices and open the door to new features, helping lower-tier brands step up into the premium range. Market observers expect the segment to be the fastest-growing area in an otherwise shrinking smartphone field.

The question is whether Apple will ultimately help solidify the foldables concept or miss out on it, said Neil Mawston, director of research at Strategy Analytics.

‚ÄúApple has the power to make or break the future foldables industry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLaunch too early, and a market-unready foldable could trash the whole iPhone franchise. If Apple does not have a foldable iPhone or iPad on sale by 2025, when industry revenues will approach tens of billions of dollars, then we‚Äôd start to get a little worried.‚Äù

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company makes the majority of its revenue from the iPhone lineup ‚Äî which is incrementally improved annually and hasn‚Äôt made major leaps in design or function for years. So far, foldables have yet to reach large enough volumes to take meaningful share away from Apple, which controlled 77% of the market for phones above $751 last year, according to Omdia analyst Jusy Hong.

For now, foldables are an Android-only contest, dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. on the global stage. But competition is more intense in China, where local brands are using such devices to go upscale. Xiaomi Corp., Huawei Technologies Co., Vivo and Oppo each have several models on the market now. Honor, an independent brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, is also helping make the segment more affordable with its Honor Magic Vs device this year.

Chinese brands face increasing pressure to differentiate their products and encourage users to upgrade, especially as the broader phone industry stalls. The domestic smartphone market suffered double-digit shipment declines over the past year. And unlike Apple, which has fostered a virtuous cycle of customers upgrading their iPhones every couple of years, the more fungible Android brands have to win customers anew with every new device. A foldable option helps do that.

That‚Äôs evident at a company like Oppo, the largest smartphone maker in China.

‚ÄúFoldables are the future and are of utmost importance to Oppo‚Äôs overall product strategy,‚Äù said Billy Zhang, president of overseas sales and services at Oppo. His sentiment is echoed by Honor, which expects China to be the first market where foldables start to lead the premium segment. Close collaboration with local suppliers helps improve portability and affordability quickly, according to an Honor spokesperson, and 90% of the top 5,000 apps in China have already been adapted for foldable devices.

The development of foldable devices is capital-intensive, as it requires the design and refinement of hinges that are durable and thin. There are further innovations required, such as Samsung‚Äôs ultrathin glass screen cover, which allows for the familiar glass-like feel on a surface that‚Äôs able to bend and flex.

Google‚Äôs involvement in the foldable segment had until this week been limited to software. The Alphabet-owned company is responsible for developing Android and has been collaborating with Samsung since the 2019 introduction of the first Galaxy Fold handset to make the operating system and its apps work with such devices. Its own Pixel Fold may provide welcome competition to Samsung, which still enjoys a first-mover advantage and a 79% share of the global market, according to IDC‚Äôs Bryan Ma.

For Apple, its first entry into this category is more likely to be a tablet than a foldable iPhone, according to mobile industry veteran and CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood and Omdia‚Äôs Hong. Wood expects a ‚Äúsuper-premium iPad with a flexible display‚Äù in 2024. Hong, meanwhile, sees the crease in the middle of foldable screens as a major obstacle to Apple‚Äôs adoption. That imperfection is much improved since first-generation Samsung devices, but it lingers even in the latest models. And the iPhone maker is famously demanding in its choices of display technology.

‚ÄúIt is unthinkable that Apple has not been experimenting with flexible display technology in its product development labs for a decade or more,‚Äù Wood said. ‚ÄúThe strength of the existing iPhone portfolio and the high margins it commands obviates the need for Apple to react to rival folding smartphone devices.‚Äù

1,good,True,positive,13240,"The historic increase in mortgage rates this year, sparked by the Federal Reserve‚Äö√Ñ√¥s aggressive campaign to tame inflation, has pulled back housing demand and crushed builder confidence.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage sits near 7%, according to Freddie Mac. 

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The rapid rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty, have made many buyers pause in their home-buying decision or choose to not move forward with their home purchase,‚Äö√Ñ√π President and CEO David Auld said in a conference call to discuss earnings.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫What it's going to come down to is we need a stabilization [of] rates ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ full stop ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ that's what we need,‚Äö√Ñ√π John Lovallo, an UBS analyst, told Yahoo Finance.",Buyers canceled nearly a third of deals in D.R.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai informed the company earlier this year that some 12,000 positions would be eliminated due to persistent macroeconomic turmoil. A memo sent by Google CFO Ruth Porat on Friday and obtained by Business Insider likewise said that the ‚Äúchallenging economic environment‚Äù and ‚Äúincredible investment opportunities to drive technology forward‚Äù would necessitate changes to the company‚Äôs cost structure.

The workforce reductions will therefore precede the restructuring of technology operations for greater maximization of resources, as well as reforms to external procurement and contracting processes. Even as such changes will not ‚Äúbe visible‚Äù to most employees, the ‚Äúindustry-leading perks, benefits and office amenities‚Äù at Google will be scaled back to reduce expenses.

‚ÄúCafes, MicroKitchens and other facilities will be tailored to better match how and when they are being used. Decisions will be based on data,‚Äù the memo said. ‚ÄúFor example, where a cafe is seeing a significantly lower volume of use on certain days, we‚Äôll close it on those days and put more focus instead on popular options that are close by. Similarly, we‚Äôll consolidate MicroKitchens in buildings where we‚Äôre seeing more waste than value.‚Äù

The cost reductions will also apply to ‚Äúsome fitness classes and shuttle schedules‚Äù based on the extent to which they are used. Equipment and technology utilized by employees will also be assessed, permitting Google to ‚Äúsave meaningfully‚Äù given the size of the firm.

The memo comes after at least 31 massage therapists and 21 members of the trust and safety department were dismissed as part of the layoffs, according to disclosures the firm made with the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification system obtained by The Daily Wire. One employee with the title of ‚ÄúDiversity Manager‚Äù and another with the title of ‚ÄúDiversity Specialist‚Äù were also listed in the disclosures; the latter position earned annual compensation ranging between $90,000 and $148,000, according to an estimate from Glassdoor.

‚ÄúJust as we did in 2008, we‚Äôll be looking at data to identify other areas of spending that aren‚Äôt as effective as they should be, or that don‚Äôt scale at our size,‚Äù the memo added. ‚ÄúWe will let Googlers know of any other changes that directly impact services they use.‚Äù

Most prominent technology companies started to reduce headcount as the elevated consumer demand which followed the lockdown-induced recession began to slow. More than 130,000 workers have been dismissed from technology firms so far in 2023, according to a report from Crunchbase, even after companies nixed about 93,000 positions last year.

Twitter CEO Elon Musk has also implemented reforms to the amenities and perks offered by the social media company. The firm auctioned off La Marzocco espresso machines and Rotisol rotisserie ovens, as well as commercial blenders and grinders, refrigerators, grills and griddles, fryers, braising pans, and pizza ovens, according to a list posted by Heritage Global Partners. Electronics and furniture available for auction included Google Jamboards, NEC projectors, phones and speakerphones, soft seats and furnishings, and hundreds of office chairs.

Musk dismissed two-thirds of workers and told remaining employees that they should expect ‚Äúextremely hardcore‚Äù working hours if they desired to stay at the company. He added that Twitter would become ‚Äúmuch more engineering-driven,‚Äù implying a move away from ‚Äúdesign and product management‚Äù emphases.","Google Workers Lose Fitness Classes, MicroKitchens, Other Perks As Company Cuts Costs",causal,"NEC, CEO, CFO","['W', 'R', 'UBS', 'D', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'A']","['D', 'R', 'DHI']","['CFO', 'CEO', 'NEC']","['NEC', 'W', 'R', 'UBS', 'DHI', 'D', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'A']",-0.99316365

Coming into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 1.8% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 5.62%, while the S&P 500 lost 3.9%.

Amazon will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.20, down 4.76% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $124.43 billion, up 6.86% from the year-ago period.

Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.33 per share and revenue of $556.27 billion. These totals would mark changes of +87.32% and +8.23%, respectively, from last year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 3.67% lower. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Looking at its valuation, Amazon is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 74.23. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.22, so we one might conclude that Amazon is trading at a premium comparatively.

Meanwhile, AMZN's PEG ratio is currently 4.1. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Commerce industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.11 as of yesterday's close.

The Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 75, putting it in the top 30% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

The guidance noted that physicians should consider non-opioid treatments for acute pain, which is typically defined as pain lasting a month or less, and, when prescribing opioids, to consider immediate-release versions versus long-acting ones, which have more short-term effects.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has softened its recommendations for doctors prescribing opioid painkillers, giving providers more flexibility in the way they prescribe the drugs to treat short- and long-term pain.",CVS,Health Care,Drug Retailers,CVS Health Corporation,2022-11-10T16:21:22+00:00,2022-11-10,2022-11-10T16:21:22+00:00,[{'name': 'Finance'}],"A lighter-than-expected inflation report sparked a major relief rally Thursday, and those stocks that had been hurt the most by soaring costs could lead this market comeback.

That reputation for resilience will be tested again.

A new five-year contract with the Teamsters union, ratified by the union‚Äôs rank-and-file Aug. 22, imposes a significant cost burden on UPS (NYSE: UPS) during its first year. The initial payout, which has been estimated at an 8%-9% increase over the prior contract‚Äôs most recent levels, is retroactive to Aug. 1.

UPS will try to extract higher prices from its customers to recoup those higher costs, amid a cycle of slowing demand for parcel delivery services and increasing competition from regional carriers and parcel consolidators. At the same time, it is trying to recover traffic that skittish shippers diverted to rivals during the noisy pre-contract negotiation process, as well as win volumes that shippers were originally expected to tender but subsequently pulled back from out of an abundance of caution.

UPS must also respond to rival FedEx Corp.‚Äôs (NYSE: FDX) announcement this week of a 5.9% noncontract rate increase ‚Äî known in the trade as ‚Äúgeneral rate increases‚Äù ‚Äî on its 2024 FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services. That is 100 basis points below the record 6.9% rate hike that both carriers imposed in 2023.

Tariff rates serve as a benchmark for the contractual agreements that dominate the parcel industry. The prices that customers actually pay will vary widely depending on multiple factors. For example, rates on certain shipments may exceed 5.9%, while rates on others may drop below that threshold, thus neutralizing each other and resulting in a 5.9% overall increase. Delivery surcharges, which have grown in number and cost, will likely take up many shipper rates by 10% year on year, said Branden Burt, director of parcel operations for consultancy TransImpact LLC.

With current inflation rates abating over 2022 levels, FedEx‚Äôs lower GRI threshold could not have been all that much of a surprise. Still, the timing of the move left some wondering if FedEx was sending a shot across the bow at UPS and if it was intent on keeping UPS‚Äô business that came its way in the months leading up to the contract‚Äôs ratification.

In a research note, Ken Hoexter, analyst at Bank of America, said that FedEx appears ‚Äúpoised to set a market ceiling in the global integrator sector, potentially limiting UPS‚Äô ability to offset steep year 1 Teamster pay increases‚Äù in the contract.

Ronald Liebman, partner and head, transportation, logistics and supply chain management group for the law firm McCarter & English LLP, said it is ‚Äúmore likely‚Äù that UPS‚Äô GRI will exceed FedEx‚Äôs because of the cost pressures emanating from the Teamsters contract.

When calculating its GRI, UPS will need to balance its higher cost to serve with concerns that it may alienate shippers it is trying to win back. Under current market conditions, it will be difficult for UPS to move much above FedEx‚Äôs GRI, if it can at all. Nate Skiver, head of consultancy LPF Spend Management LLC, said stagnant volumes don‚Äôt justify it. Burt, who forecast a 5.9% increase for FedEx, expects UPS to match FedEx in part because decelerating inflation makes anything above that threshold implausible.

Scott Lord, a former UPS executive who now runs Strategic Growth Advisory LLC, a consultancy, expects UPS to clock in with a 6.9% rate increase in part because tight capacity gives shippers little leverage. That view runs counter to estimates from SJ Consulting, another consultancy, that daily capacity currently exceeds 110 million parcels while daily demand is a little more than half that.

UPS is highly skilled at growing per-package revenue without straight rate hikes and will no doubt leverage those capabilities to build profitable revenue absent a sky-high GRI, experts said. UPS often ties shipper discounts to strict revenue commitments, an approach that Skiver said effectively locks in customers for the duration of a contract. Skiver also said that he expects UPS to be ‚Äúselectively aggressive‚Äù in order to regain large shipper business, but that it won‚Äôt fully open the spigots just to fill the network. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not their approach,‚Äù he said.

In addition, as UPS gradually parts ways with Amazon.com Inc., its largest customer but which generally tenders lower-yielding traffic, it will replace that business with higher-margin traffic from small and midsize (SMB) customers, Skiver said. ‚ÄúThis affords UPS the flexibility to backfill Amazon revenue with a combination of high-yield volume from SMBs and ‚Äòaggressively discounted‚Äô enterprise retailer volume,‚Äù Skiver said. While UPS has much ground to cover to replace lost revenue and cover increased labor expenses, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they need to do it through a higher GRI,‚Äù he said.

Lord said UPS will continue to work toward improving the profitability of its relationships with large shippers. ‚ÄúI am sure that UPS has been either removing rate caps‚Äù ‚Äî which are maximum allowed annual rate increases allowed under contract ‚Äî ‚Äúor increasing what the caps are,‚Äù Lord said. Traditionally, the rate caps have been in the 3% range, but Lord surmised they are hitting the 4% range or higher.

UPS is also extremely proficient at increasing surcharges to cover segments of its network that have higher costs to serve, such as residential deliveries, Lord said. In addition, UPS will tout its reputation as a premium service provider to convince shippers that the company offers a superior value proposition to FedEx, he said.

UPS declined comment for this story. Around mid-September, it is expected to hold an in-depth analyst meeting to discuss the contract‚Äôs impact. In a statement, FedEx said ‚Äúthis year‚Äôs adjustments reflect our intent to support our customers by continuing to deliver outstanding service at competitive rates.‚Äù FedEx will provide more detail on its pricing moves on Sept. 7.

In its GRI announcement, FedEx said it would also raise rates on its Ground Economy product but declined to be specific. Ground Economy is designed to handle lightweight, non-urgent parcels at low rates. Because it competes with UPS‚Äô SurePost product managed in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Service‚Äôs last-mile delivery network, those changes will be keenly monitored, especially since language in the Teamsters contract calls for diverting as much as 50% of SurePost volumes from the Postal Service to UPS Teamster drivers by the end of the contract.

I call them The Sacred Seven. They are Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Netflix and Tesla (TSLA).

In 2022, all seven stocks were flattened. Here‚Äôs what each stock gained in 2017-2021, and what each stock has lost since I last wrote about them (December 28, 2021).

This column a year ago was titled Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon: Which Stocks Should You Own? Those two were Alphabet and Apple.

The five stocks I suggested people avoid were down 46.8% from December 28, 2021 through December 23, 2022. To be sure, it was a down year, with the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Total Return Index dropping 18.4%. But the Sacred Seven did much worse.

The two I liked were down 33.1%, better than most of their brethren but considerably worse than the S&P.

Here‚Äôs what I think of the Sacred Seven now.

In the past decade, Alphabet shares have sold for an average of 27 times the company‚Äôs earnings per share. Currently that multiple is below 18. Not bad, I‚Äôd say, for a company that has grown its earnings by an average of 15% a year for the past decade).

The company‚Äôs subsidiaries include the Google search engine, You Tube video platform, Waymo self-driving cars, and Deep Mind artificial intelligence unit. (My daughter works for Deep Mind, which may prejudice me in Alphabet‚Äôs favor.)

I expect Amazon to be a business success, but a stock-market disappointment in 2023. The company lost momentum this year as people returned to brick-and-mortar stores. I expect that it will pick up market share in the next few years because people like the convenience of online shopping.

The stock, however, reminds me of IBM and McDonald‚Äôs in the Nifty Fifty Era around 1972. The companies did well but the stocks didn‚Äôt, because they were priced for perfection at about 60 times earnings. Amazon sells for 78 times earnings.

I still like Apple for the same reasons I did a year ago. Its iPhones and Mac computers have a loyal following. I like the company‚Äôs $48 billion in cash and marketable securities, and I love the 25% profit margin. At 22 times earnings, the stock is more expensive than I usually prefer, but not outlandish.

In addition to Facebook, Meta Platforms owns Instagram, Messenger and What‚Äôs App. That‚Äôs a worthy collection of assets, and the stock sells for only 11 times recent earnings. So I should like it, but I‚Äôm lukewarm.

What worries me is that I think Facebook‚Äôs past success stemmed in large part from sharing information about its customers with advertisers. I believe regulators will make it harder for Facebook and its brethren to do this. All in all, I think the stock will be a market performer or slightly better.

A powerhouse in both cloud computing and personal computing, Microsoft can boast a ten-year annual earnings-growth rate of nearly 17%. Last year, however, it was below 4%. I think future growth will be way above 4%, and I think profitability will be excellent.

Alas, the stock is pricey. It sells for nearly nine times the company‚Äôs revenue. To me, that‚Äôs a dangerously high multiple.

The days of rapid subscriber growth for streaming companies seem to be over, now that we‚Äôve already reached the point where more than half the programs Americans watch are streamed. To compete for market share, many streaming companies, including Netflix, are spending heavily on original content.

Netflix has had hits with many of its programs, such as The Queen‚Äôs Gambit, The Squid Game and Lupin. But such shows cost a lot of money. The earnings growth rate for Netflix in the past decade has been nearly 54%. Last year? Less than 1%.

The leading electric car maker is a cult stock. People adore it or hate it ‚Äì and the same goes for CEO Elon Musk. Of all the Sacred Seven, Tesla had the best return in 2017-2021, and the worst in the past year. With competition increasing in both China and the U.S., I think it‚Äôs in for another tough year.

All the three indexes were set for sharp weekly losses.

According to a new report from Axios, Bloomberg is looking to expand his media empire and would prefer a Dow Jones acquisition due to its all-encompassing business coverage. The report said, however, that he would be willing to purchase The Washington Post if Bezos were willing to sell.

The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment, while a News Corp spokesperson declined to comment on the report.

Dow Jones is ultimately owned by News Corp's (NWSA) Rupert Murdoch, who is himself reportedly considering a recombination of Fox (FOXA) and the mass media and publishing company.

According to an October report from Murdoch-owned The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the 91-year-old businessman is in early discussions to rejoin the two entities of his media empire, which formerly split in 2013. Disney acquired the bulk of Fox's entertainment assets in a $71 billion deal back in 2019.

The WSJ report added that both companies have established special board committees to study a possible deal and evaluate potential financial terms.

Media mergers and acquisitions have been on the upswing, with major corporations like Paramount Global (PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently completing their own respective consolidations. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) closed its $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios in March.

Lack of cash and increased competition have served as catalysts to the recent activity, with many conglomerates searching for new revenue drivers and monetization opportunities.

""It's a pretty good inflection point,"" Jon Christian, EVP of digital media supply chain at Qvest, the largest media- and entertainment-focused consulting company, told Yahoo Finance. ""The game has changed. It used to be just subscribers at all cost ... but now [investors] need these services to be profitable.""

Bart Spiegel, partner of global entertainment & media deals at PwC, added: ""We're entering a chapter two of the streaming wars.""

""Only time will tell, but I think everything's on the table to try to improve profitability and make the platforms more creative to their overall business,"" Spiegel continued.

Other possible acquisition targets in 2023 and beyond include the embattled Warner Bros. Discovery.

Lionsgate's film and TV studio, which the entertainment giant plans to spin off into a separate company, will also be for sale, while AMC Networks (AMCX) continues to undergo a restructuring that could result in an acquisition.

Needham's Laura Martin wrote in a recent client note that Paramount could be attractive to unload, while smaller players like WWE (WWE), Curiosity Stream (CURIW), and Chicken Soup for the Soul (CSSE) will likely sell due to their respective sizes.

Disney CEO Bob Iger, who returned to the media conglomerate to much fanfare in November, will also face a slew of decisions ‚Äî including what to do with notable assets like Hulu (sell it to Comcast?) and ESPN (spin it off?)

Despite selling some of the most expensive devices on the market, an investigation has found that Apple devices are hardest to fix, followed by Google and Microsoft.

Apple's MacBooks were twice as difficult to open up and repair as the cheaper options sold by Dell, which was found to have the most repairable laptops.

In the smartphone category, Apple's iPhones ranked lowest for 'repairability', while Motorola ‚Äì best known for its retro flip phones ‚Äì ranked highest.

Apple recently introduced a self-repair service to customers in the UK, although it's been criticised for being too complex and having 'disastrous' results.

The new investigation was conducted by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a US non-profit organisation and part of 'right-to-repair' movement, which pressures tech giants to make devices easier to fix and help reduce e-waste.

'Manufacturers are improving but are not yet good enough,' said Lucas Gutterman, director of the 'designed to last campaign' at PIRG, in a blog post.

'Repair scores like this provide important information for consumers so they can make the best purchasing choices for their budget.

'It's ridiculous to spend so much on expensive tech which is disposable.

'We have been calling for better access to the parts, tools and information needed to repair modern devices.

'Companies should do more to design their products to last.'

MailOnline has contacted Apple, Google and Microsoft - which have a collective market worth of nearly ¬£6.1 trillion (¬£5 trillion) ‚Äì for comment.

For the investigation, researchers assessed how easy it was to disassemble more than 200 laptops and 90 smartphones combined from 10 companies ‚Äì Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Lenovo, Motorola, Acer, Dell, Asus and HP.

Each device maker was given a score out of 10 and a corresponding grade ranging from A plus to F, much like a school report card.

Factored in was availability and pricing of spare parts and instruction manuals, and the accessibility of software updates.

Scores were reduced if firms had lobbied against 'right-to-repair' legislation, which makes it easier for consumers to fix a broken or damaged device.

Big tech firms often oppose such legislation because it deprives them of sales.

In the laptops category, Dell ranked top with a B+, followed by Asus (B+), HP (B), Acer (B-), Lenovo (B-), Microsoft (D+) and Apple (D-).

In smartphones, meanwhile, Motorola was top (B+), followed by Samsung (C), Google (D+) and lastly Apple (D).

According to the report, Apple, Google and Microsoft were all marked down for lobbying against right-to-repair legislation, but the other seven companies did not so this didn't affect their scores.

An example is a bill that was 'quietly killed' in committee last May despite consumer support for fixable products, the Register reported at the time.

The new investigation also found laptops from Dell, HP, Asus and Acer had become slightly easier to repair over the past year, while those from Lenovo had got harder to repair.

Apple and Microsoft laptops had become marginally easier to repair compared with last year, but both still lagged far behind in the D category.

Apple and Google phones have slightly improved in a year but were still placed last, while Samsung and Motorola scores decreased but this hasn't affected their grades.

Researchers also found no correlation between price and repairability, meaning the cheapest devices were not the hardest to repair, as one might expect.

Apple was singled out for the cost of spare parts, although the tech giant is rolling out its self-repair service to customers in an effort to boost its green credentials.

Apple's programme ships replacement parts and tools to people's houses for a fee so they can fix their broken iPhones and Mac computers.

However, Apple said the programme is only suited to 'customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices'.

It means those who lack understanding or have little confidence in their ability to make a fix might be better off taking their device to a professional.

One attempt at self-repair with an iPhone 12 that simply aimed to change the battery ended in 'disaster' and a broken phone, according to The New York Times.

Reviews have suggested the programme is designed to make it look like Apple supports right-to-repair, while really discouraging repairs by making it too complex for non-experts.

According to scientists and green campaigners, major tech companies including Apple and Google have deliberately made their devices hard to fix.

'Smartphones and many other tech devices are increasingly being designed in ways that make it challenging to repair or replace individual components,' said Ritesh Chugh, a professor of IT at CQUniversity in Queensland, Australia.

'This might involve soldering the processor and flash memory to the motherboard, gluing components together unnecessarily, or using non-standard pentalobe screws which make replacements problematic.'

When big tech firms regularly release new products with incremental upgrades, the old ones are often stashed in the home.

Eventually they're discarded and added to mountains of e-waste ‚Äì wasting resources and blighting the environment.

After a device is discarded and e-waste is warmed up, toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases are released into the air damaging the atmosphere.

What's more, e-waste in landfills can seep toxic materials into groundwater, poisoning and killing animals and plants.

In Europe, extending the lifespan of smartphones and other devices by just one year would save as much carbon emissions as taking two million cars off the roads annually, a 2019 study found.

The full lifecycle of Europe's smartphones is responsible for 14 million tonnes of emissions per year, which is more than the carbon budget of Latvia, it said.

E-waste (electronic waste) includes anything with plugs, cords and electronic components. Common sources of e-waste include smartphones, TVs, computers and any type of home appliance, from air conditioners to children's toys. These electronics contain valuable non-renewable resources including gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminium and cobalt. This means when we dispose of them without recycling, we are throwing away precious materials. Human health is jeopardized by the 'informal processing' - such as burning - of discarded e-waste, according to a 2021 report from the World Health Organization. E-waste-connected health risks can result from direct contact with harmful materials such as lead, cadmium, chromium, or brominated flame retardants. They are also triggered by inhalation of toxic fumes, as well as from accumulation of chemicals in soil, water and food. For an expectant mother, exposure to toxic e-waste can affect the health and development of her unborn child for the rest of its life.","Apple, Google and Microsoft devices are hardest to fix, report says",non-causal,"US, UK, HP, IT, PIRG",['FDA'],[],"['PIRG', 'IT', 'HP', 'UK', 'US']","['FDA', 'PIRG', 'IT', 'US', 'HP', 'UK', 'MDT']",-0.23593774

Even so, Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers who use so-called free delivery to cultivate customer loyalty are scrambling to keep it from draining profits as costs climb and e-commerce contracts.

They are adding fees for faster service, raising minimum purchase requirements and making other changes that shift more costs to consumers who are struggling with financial issues of their own.

""The days of free delivery are numbered,"" Ken Morris, managing partner at Cambridge Retail Advisors, said of the fast-changing retail marketing tool.

Retailers are beginning to look more like some airlines, which charge for better seating, transporting luggage and also restrict use of frequent flyer points, Morris said.

It is an open secret that most retailers raise product prices to subsidize free shipping. Still, product inflation and soaring shipping costs are making the service unsustainable as the prospect of recession threatens to wallop already-flagging online spending.

Amazon marketed free shipping as a differentiator and used pricey Prime subscriptions and fat profits from other businesses to underwrite its package delivery costs - forcing other retailers to follow, even if they lacked Amazon's advantages.

With retail margins shrinking and shipping rates for United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx Corp and the U.S. Postal Service hitting record levels, the industry where nearly three-quarters of e-commerce companies offer some sort of free shipping is rethinking the financial cost of habituating shoppers to free shipping.

Retailers' top priority is lowering shipping costs, with speed a close second, said Lee Spratt, CEO of DHL eCommerce Solutions America, which provides logistics services.

Retailers from Amazon to dog treat seller Einstein Pets and ubiquitous apparel chains like Zara, Abercrombie & Fitch and Foot Locker are drawing the line at losing money on a service consumers have come to expect.

That is translating into shipping cost reduction goals of up to 25%, said Mingshu Bates, chief analytics officer at consultancy AFS Logistics.

After forcing both free and fast shipping on the e-commerce industry it dominates, Amazon's latest moves are instructive.

The online retailer, which recently hiked the annual Prime subscription price by $20 to $139, is now offering ""free"" same-day shipping for Prime members in at least a dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. There are strings attached, however, as the service is free only on orders of at least $25, and costs $2.99 when orders fall below that.

At the start of March, Amazon also raised the minimum threshold for free Prime shipping from its struggling online grocery business to $150 from $35 and added charges of $3.95 to $9.95 for orders below the new limit.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in February said the company is streamlining costs across the business and that shipping speed would not be a casualty of its efficiency push. A spokesperson on Thursday added that Prime delivery speeds got faster from 2021 to 2022 and are improving further this year.

'WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR?'

Meanwhile, some consultants and customers are noticing service changes.

""Getting things to people same-day or within a certain number of hours doesn't seem to be first and foremost anymore"" at Amazon, e-commerce consultant Chris McCabe said.

Dozens of Prime subscribers, including upstate New York middle-school teacher Bryan Fabiano, have taken to social media to question the value of their Prime subscriptions due to late package deliveries, particularly during the holidays.

""My wife and I are Prime customers because of the shipping (benefits). If they're not going to deliver on that, then what are we paying for?"" Fabiano, 48, told Reuters.

Indeed, shoppers who do not subscribe to Prime get free standard shipping on Amazon orders over $25. Walmart Inc and Target Corp, which have delivery subscriptions of about $100 per year, offer free shipping on orders above $35 for non-members.

Nearly three-quarters of the top 1,000 U.S. retailers offered free shipping on at least some orders, with 45% requiring a minimum purchase for that perk, according to August 2022 survey results from industry research firm Digital Commerce 360.

While retailers like Amazon and fashion purveyor Asos Plc have raised thresholds for fast shipping, others are dropping free shipping altogether or taking product prices up again.

Einstein Pets in Atlanta was caught ""between a rock and a hard place"" according to owner Kelly Ison. She moved to protect profit by ending free shipping in mid-2022 on purchases of Einstein's specialty dog treats, including flavors like PB‚ÄôN Jelly Time and Pumpkin Time.

""We can't compete with Amazon,"" she told Reuters.

Ison switched to flat-rate shipping of $8 to help defray fast-rising delivery costs and avoid price increases that would hurt her competitiveness. She lost some customers, but remains profitable.

Toronto-based United Filter Co raised prices on its furnace filters so it could keep offering free shipping for sales through Amazon, Walmart and Ebay and it has never offered across-the-board free returns because they are too ""cost-prohibitive,"" owner Darrin Landau told Reuters.

The company split the difference, he said. ""People are just addicted to free shipping.""

Blackjack losses on the Strip were nearly $1 billion last year, according to official figures, and tables in some casinos now offer odds of 3:2 if a player gets 21 from their first two cards. Roulette, triple-zero tables, and minimum bets are also rising, meaning players must risk more cash to play games. Casino bosses are attempting to draw in 'higher value customers' while players with less cash to wager are priced out. The changes come as the overall price of a vacation to Las Vegas increases, with costs at hotels and restaurants also on the rise. Casinos also raise minimum bets from $25 to $50 on busy nights, while some have also done away with $15 minimums entirely.",Gamblers are wagering more than ever in Las Vegas as casinos increase odds and reduce payouts in some of the most popular games.,CZR,Services,Casinos & Gaming,"Caesars Entertainment, Inc.",2023-02-05T13:28:53+00:00,2023-02-05,2023-02-05T13:28:53+00:00,[{'name': 'Finance'}],"We're halfway there. Roughly 50% of S & P 500 companies have posted earnings thus far, and the results have been mixed. Just 69.7% have beaten expectations, according to FactSet. That beat rate is below a 79% three-year average beat rate, according to data from The Earnings Scout. There have been some big positive surprises, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Apple and Google-parent Alphabet, however, both posted quarterly misses. This week kicks off the second half of the earnings season, with 87 S & P 500 companies on deck to report. These include Disney and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Here's a breakdown of what to expect from those two reports, as well as other key names. Tuesday Chipotle Mexican Grill is set to report earnings after the bell, followed by a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET. Last quarter: CMG posted better-than-expected results as higher ticket prices offset weakening customer visits . This quarter: Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect earnings per share to have jumped nearly 60%. They also forecast a double-digit revenue expansion. What CNBC restaurant reporter Amelia Lucas is watching: ""In recent quarters, the biggest question for Chipotle has been how strong the burrito chain's pricing power is. CEO Brian Niccol has said the company hasn't seen significant resistance to higher prices, but its traffic fell in the third quarter. Will the trend reverse ‚Äî or worsen? The chain recently announced it's looking to beef up its workforce by adding 15,000 restaurant-level employees, a sign that demand may holding steady despite inflationary pressures."" What history shows: Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows Chipotle beats earnings expectations 76% of the time and averages a 1.7% gain on earnings day. The company has also posted better-than-expected earnings for seven straight quarters, per FactSet. Wednesday CVS Health is set to report earnings before the open, with management slated to hold a call at 8 a.m. ET. Last quarter: CVS raised its outlook and posted a quarterly revenue that beat expectations . This quarter: The company's top line is expected to be little changed from the year-earlier period, while earnings are forecast to have dropped slightly, per Refinitiv. What CNBC is watching: CVS said in early January that it expects Medicare Advantage enrollment will grow in the mid-single digits in 2023. This is ""disappointing given it is below market growth of high-single digits,"" Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes said in a note last month. Updates on that front could lead to positive, or negative, swings for the stock. What history shows: CVS's earnings per share have exceeded analyst expectations for 27 straight quarters, FactSet data shows. Yum Brands is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a conference call at 8:15 a.m. ET. Last quarter: YUM reported a weaker-than-expected profit as a strong U.S. dollar offset sales increases at KFC and Taco Bell . This quarter: Analysts expect a profit jump of more than 20%, Refinitiv data shows, but revenue is only forecast to grow slightly. What CNBC restaurant reporter Amelia Lucas is watching: ""The restaurant company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, is expected to report strong U.S. sales, but the focus will be on its international performance. Rival McDonald's said that European markets are performing better than expected. Investors will also be listening for updates on how China, KFC's largest market, is bouncing back after the government relaxed its zero-Covid policy."" What history shows: Bespoke data shows that Yum Brands beats earnings estimates 82% of the time. However, the fast food company has posted four straight quarterly misses, according to FactSet. Uber Technologies is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a call at 8 a.m. ET. Last quarter: UBER reported a revenue beat and issued strong gui dance, sending the stock higher by 11% . This quarter: The ride-sharing giant is expected to report year-over-year revenue growth of more than 40%, according to Refinitiv. What CNBC is watching: While Uber's top line is expected to have grown sharply, investors will be looking for clues on how much progress the company has made toward becoming profitable. ""We estimate Bookings experience a 20% '22-'24 CAGR and 3%/4% upside to '23/'24 cons, with an underlying assumption that UBER simply maintains existing Rideshare/Restaurant Delivery market share. We also expect continued progress toward ~$5B+ in '24 EBITDA, which should improve confidence in long-term profitability,"" wrote Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni in a Jan. 29 note. What history shows: Uber averages a 1.12% gain on earnings day despite beating estimates just 47% of the time, according to Bespoke. However, the stock has fallen after two of the last three quarterly reports. Disney is set to report earnings after the close. Corporate leadership is slated to hold a call at 4:30 p.m. ET. Last quarter: DIS posted misses on earnings and key revenue segments. The company also warned of tapering streaming growth . This quarter: The media giant is expected to post a sharp drop in year-over-year earnings per share, Refinitiv data shows. What CNBC entertainment reporter Sarah Whitten is watching: ""While shareholders will still key on how many subscribers Disney's suite of streaming services added during the fiscal first-quarter report, the focus of Wednesday's report will be the return of CEO Bob Iger. His reinstatement coincides with a contentious proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz and follows a rough year for the company's stock, as soaring streaming costs and a slim slate of theatrical releases ate into profits. This is Iger's first earnings call since early 2020 and his words will set the tone for the future of the media company."" What history shows: Bespoke data shows Disney beats earnings per share estimates nearly 80% of the time. However, the stock's earnings day performance is muted, according to the data. On its most-recent earnings day, the stock dropped 13%. Thursday PayPal is set to report earnings after the close, followed by a call at 5 p.m. ET. Last quarter: PYPL dropped on light revenue guidance for the fourth quarter . This quarter: PayPal's top and bottom lines are expected to have grown slightly from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv. What CNBC is watching: Investors will be looking for clues on whether the payments giant can maintain its market share. ""We believe the most important metrics on the upcoming print will be 4Q22 US Branded [total payment volume] growth where we think the bogey is ~4% Y/Y (lower end of US eComm reported averages),"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, Gol Linhas GOL, Delta Air Lines DAL and JetBlue Airways JBLU.

Here are highlights from Friday‚Äôs Analyst Blog:

In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings lifted its profit after tax view for fiscal 2023 (ending Mar 31, 2023), owing to upbeat traffic in the Christmas season. Latin American carrier, Gol Linhas expects net revenues to be around R$20 billion for 2023, higher than the 2022 expectation of R$15.2 billion.

Delta Air Lines was also in the news when it announced free Wi-Fi service on quite a few of DAL‚Äôs domestic routes. JetBlue Airways was also a newsmaker in the past week, courtesy of the decision to tweak its New York-to-London flight schedule.

1 For the fourth quarter of 2022, Gol Linhas anticipates the EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, while it expects the EBIT margin to be 11%. GOL estimates the average fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.05. GOL anticipates a loss per share of $1.20 for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. The unfavorable forecast is mainly due to high fuel costs.

Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 42% year over year, backed by a 45% increase in the average jet fuel price, partially offset by a reduction of nearly 2% in fuel consumption per flight hour due to the higher number of 737-MAXs in the fleet. For 2023, GOL anticipates earnings of 20 cents per share.

To meet the expected domestic air-travel demand of nearly 100 billion revenue passenger kilometers for 2023, GOL aims to operate 120 aircraft on average during the year. GOL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), anticipates to end 2023 with 53 Boeing MAX aircraft in its fleet. These Boeing MAX jets should boost productivity, reduce unit costs and lower carbon emissions.

2. Ryanair expects its third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) performance to have been boosted by the surge in traffic witnessed during the peak Christmas/New Year periods. Riding on the stronger-than-expected passenger volumes, profit after tax in the third quarter is anticipated to be nearly ‚Ç¨200 million. Detailed third-quarter results will be out on Jan 30. Riding on a strong Q3, profit after tax for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be in the ‚Ç¨1.325 billion ‚Äì ‚Ç¨1.425 billion range (earlier guidance was in the ‚Ç¨1 billion to ‚Ç¨1.20 billion band).

RYAAY was also in the news recently regarding an enquiry by antitrust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-fixing. That story was covered in the previous week‚Äôs write-up.

3. In a bid to make air-travel more attractive, Delta‚Äôs management announced that free Wi-Fi will be available on more than 500 DAL planes operating on its most popular routes from February. This facility is expected to be available on all DAL flights across the globe by 2024-end in partnership with T-Mobile.

4. JetBlue‚Äôs management has reportedly decided to add a new flight departing in the mornings from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow Airport from Mar 25. The new flight was added as JBLU got access to an additional pair of slots. JBLU has also decided to trim its schedule on the JFK - Gatwick Airport route. Only one flight will operate daily on the route from Mar 25, instead of the current two. The current daily schedule of three flights from JFK and London's two airports will remain unchanged.

All airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased 7.1% to $56.02 over the past week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0.8%.

What's Next in the Airline Space?

For the airline space, Delta will kickstart the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season on Jan 13. Upbeat air-travel demand is expected to have aided DAL‚Äôs fourth-quarter performance.

In the company‚Äôs fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, it beat on both the top and bottom line with reported revenue of $72.09 billion dollars, slightly higher than Bloomberg estimates of $71.89 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, higher than estimates of $4.14.

Wall Street analysts are confident in Costco's ability to keep the momentum going, despite shares dropping 2 percent in after-market trading Thursday.

In a note to investors, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating with an updated 12-month price target of $548, citing that top-line trends remain healthy, supported by membership gains.

‚ÄúWe continue to have confidence in COST‚Äôs value proposition resonating with consumers, while the company‚Äôs scale and limited SKU model enable it to manage current inflationary cost pressures,‚Äù the note said.

JPMorgan currently holds an overweight rating on the company with a $550.00 price target. JPMorgan retail analyst Christopher Horvers calls the company a ‚Äúcore holding‚Äù though.

In the note, Horvers said: ‚ÄúWe believe COST continues to be a core holding given that its unrivaled value proposition (11% gross margins) to its fiercely loyal customer base (~90% renewal rate) and global growth opportunity (2-3% annually and likely double the current store base from here) are a rare combination in retail and consumer staples.‚Äù

After-market close Friday, shares of the company closed at $466.40 per share, down -4.26%.

This quarter, Costco had 65.8M paid household members and 118.9M cardholders, both up 6.5% compared to a year ago.

With customers willing to pay up and inflation taking a toll on skyrocketing grocery prices, CFO and Executive VP Richard Galanti said a fee hike could come in the future, but not right now.

‚ÄúThere are no specific plans regarding a fee increase at this time. We‚Äôre pleased with our growth in both, top-line sales and membership households over the last several quarters, and member loyalty is reflected in increasing member renewal rates. We‚Äôll let you know when something is about to happen,‚Äù he said on a call with investors.

Typically, Costco hikes its membership every 5 years and seven months, bringing the next potential hike in January of 2023. Galanti added that he was not suggesting it would happen, but the team is ‚Äúconfident‚Äù in its ability to do so.

‚ÄúWe are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it‚Äôs a question of when not if.‚Äù

Costco‚Äôs annual fees are more expensive than one of its closest competitors, Sam‚Äôs Club owned by Walmart (WMT), which recently raised prices back in August for the first time since 1999. Effective October 17th, the competitor‚Äôs annual membership fees will move to $50 from $45 for Club members, and to $110 from $100 for Plus members.

A segment of last year‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act comes into view this morning, with the U.S. government targeting the first 10 medical drugs to have costs subject to negotiation. Together, they made up $50 billion, about 20%, of Medicare part D costs from June 2022 through May 2023. The idea is that lowering costs of these widely-used products would help bring down inflation.

Included in the list are anti-blood clotting drugs Eliquis and Xarelto, from Bristol Myers (BMY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), respectively; type-2 diabetes med Januvia, from Merck (MRK); Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis, from Amgen (AMGN); Entresto for heart failure from Novartis (NVS) and various insulin distribution systems from Novo Nordisk (NVO), to name just a few. On the news, only J&J is slipping a little in the pre-market; perhaps this news is already partially priced-in?

After today‚Äôs opening bell, we‚Äôll see a new Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), expected to tick down from 9.58 million open jobs in the U.S. to around 9.5 million.

Despite selling some of the most expensive devices on the market, an investigation has found that Apple devices are hardest to fix, followed by Google and Microsoft.

Apple's MacBooks were twice as difficult to open up and repair as the cheaper options sold by Dell, which was found to have the most repairable laptops.

In the smartphone category, Apple's iPhones ranked lowest for 'repairability', while Motorola ‚Äì best known for its retro flip phones ‚Äì ranked highest.

Apple recently introduced a self-repair service to customers in the UK, although it's been criticised for being too complex and having 'disastrous' results.

The new investigation was conducted by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a US non-profit organisation and part of 'right-to-repair' movement, which pressures tech giants to make devices easier to fix and help reduce e-waste.

'Manufacturers are improving but are not yet good enough,' said Lucas Gutterman, director of the 'designed to last campaign' at PIRG, in a blog post.

'Repair scores like this provide important information for consumers so they can make the best purchasing choices for their budget.

'It's ridiculous to spend so much on expensive tech which is disposable.

'We have been calling for better access to the parts, tools and information needed to repair modern devices.

'Companies should do more to design their products to last.'

MailOnline has contacted Apple, Google and Microsoft - which have a collective market worth of nearly ¬£6.1 trillion (¬£5 trillion) ‚Äì for comment.

For the investigation, researchers assessed how easy it was to disassemble more than 200 laptops and 90 smartphones combined from 10 companies ‚Äì Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Lenovo, Motorola, Acer, Dell, Asus and HP.

Each device maker was given a score out of 10 and a corresponding grade ranging from A plus to F, much like a school report card.

Factored in was availability and pricing of spare parts and instruction manuals, and the accessibility of software updates.

Scores were reduced if firms had lobbied against 'right-to-repair' legislation, which makes it easier for consumers to fix a broken or damaged device.

Big tech firms often oppose such legislation because it deprives them of sales.

In the laptops category, Dell ranked top with a B+, followed by Asus (B+), HP (B), Acer (B-), Lenovo (B-), Microsoft (D+) and Apple (D-).

In smartphones, meanwhile, Motorola was top (B+), followed by Samsung (C), Google (D+) and lastly Apple (D).

According to the report, Apple, Google and Microsoft were all marked down for lobbying against right-to-repair legislation, but the other seven companies did not so this didn't affect their scores.

An example is a bill that was 'quietly killed' in committee last May despite consumer support for fixable products, the Register reported at the time.

The new investigation also found laptops from Dell, HP, Asus and Acer had become slightly easier to repair over the past year, while those from Lenovo had got harder to repair.

Apple and Microsoft laptops had become marginally easier to repair compared with last year, but both still lagged far behind in the D category.

Apple and Google phones have slightly improved in a year but were still placed last, while Samsung and Motorola scores decreased but this hasn't affected their grades.

Researchers also found no correlation between price and repairability, meaning the cheapest devices were not the hardest to repair, as one might expect.

Apple was singled out for the cost of spare parts, although the tech giant is rolling out its self-repair service to customers in an effort to boost its green credentials.

Apple's programme ships replacement parts and tools to people's houses for a fee so they can fix their broken iPhones and Mac computers.

However, Apple said the programme is only suited to 'customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices'.

It means those who lack understanding or have little confidence in their ability to make a fix might be better off taking their device to a professional.

One attempt at self-repair with an iPhone 12 that simply aimed to change the battery ended in 'disaster' and a broken phone, according to The New York Times.

Reviews have suggested the programme is designed to make it look like Apple supports right-to-repair, while really discouraging repairs by making it too complex for non-experts.

According to scientists and green campaigners, major tech companies including Apple and Google have deliberately made their devices hard to fix.

'Smartphones and many other tech devices are increasingly being designed in ways that make it challenging to repair or replace individual components,' said Ritesh Chugh, a professor of IT at CQUniversity in Queensland, Australia.

'This might involve soldering the processor and flash memory to the motherboard, gluing components together unnecessarily, or using non-standard pentalobe screws which make replacements problematic.'

When big tech firms regularly release new products with incremental upgrades, the old ones are often stashed in the home.

Eventually they're discarded and added to mountains of e-waste ‚Äì wasting resources and blighting the environment.

After a device is discarded and e-waste is warmed up, toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases are released into the air damaging the atmosphere.

What's more, e-waste in landfills can seep toxic materials into groundwater, poisoning and killing animals and plants.

In Europe, extending the lifespan of smartphones and other devices by just one year would save as much carbon emissions as taking two million cars off the roads annually, a 2019 study found.

The full lifecycle of Europe's smartphones is responsible for 14 million tonnes of emissions per year, which is more than the carbon budget of Latvia, it said.

E-waste (electronic waste) includes anything with plugs, cords and electronic components. Common sources of e-waste include smartphones, TVs, computers and any type of home appliance, from air conditioners to children's toys. These electronics contain valuable non-renewable resources including gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminium and cobalt. This means when we dispose of them without recycling, we are throwing away precious materials. Human health is jeopardized by the 'informal processing' - such as burning - of discarded e-waste, according to a 2021 report from the World Health Organization. E-waste-connected health risks can result from direct contact with harmful materials such as lead, cadmium, chromium, or brominated flame retardants. They are also triggered by inhalation of toxic fumes, as well as from accumulation of chemicals in soil, water and food. For an expectant mother, exposure to toxic e-waste can affect the health and development of her unborn child for the rest of its life.","Apple, Google and Microsoft devices are hardest to fix, report says",non-causal,"US, UK, HP, IT, PIRG",['A'],[],"['PIRG', 'IT', 'HP', 'UK', 'US']","['PIRG', 'UK', 'IT', 'ADBE', 'HP', 'A', 'US']",-0.23593774

The news comes as part of Google‚Äôs annual Google Cloud Next event, which is being held in San Francisco.

The show, the first the company has held in person since 2019, includes a series of major announcements meant to highlight Google‚Äôs cloud platform and AI capabilities as it continues to do battle with rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) in the cloud space.

That includes pricing for Google‚Äôs AI-centric Workspace features, as well as the addition of new AI training models and improved AI-centric infrastructure.

Shares of Google were up as much as 4% as of 12 p.m. ET Tuesday.

In July, Google reported its second consecutive quarter of profitability for its cloud division and said the segment reached an annual revenue run rate of $32 billion. And the company is banking on its latest products to help build on that growth.

The most intriguing news out of the show is that Google is pricing its AI-powered Duet AI in Workspace at $30 per user per month. That‚Äôs the same price Microsoft is charging for its Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Both products are meant to serve as AI assistants for workers that frequently send emails, work in spreadsheets and presentation software, draft documents, and spend a lot of time in meetings.

Duet AI in Workspace includes the ability to craft summaries from various sources in a single document. In one example, Google imagines a worker who needs to put together a presentation for financial performance over the last quarter by asking Duet AI to craft a summary of the latest quarterly data with everything from text to charts and images using information culled from your Gmail and Drive.

Duet AI in Google Meet also claims to be able to improve your overall look in a video meeting by adjusting the sound and lighting, and, more importantly, grab notes, action items, and video snippets when you ask it to ‚Äútake notes for me.‚Äù

Google says Duet AI will be able to attend meetings for you and give you a summary of everything that was covered by simply asking it to ‚Äúattend for me,‚Äù though your boss might not exactly appreciate you using the feature in a one-on-one meeting.

Google‚Äôs Chat is also getting an AI update with Duet AI in Google Chat. Improvements include a visual facelift, as well as AI capabilities such as the ability to ask Duet AI to summarize long text threads and documents.

In addition to Duet AI in Workspace, Google announced new features for its Duet AI in Google Cloud meant to help improve application development.

On the infrastructure front, Google said it is adding new AI training models to its Vertex AI platform including Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and Code Llama.

Google‚Äôs announcements are all a part of its effort to make its Google Cloud Platform more competitive with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft‚Äôs Azure. Microsoft has been aggressively pursuing adding AI capabilities to its various cloud and productivity products ever since it announced its collaboration with ChatGPT developer OpenAI in February.

That‚Äôs helped the company steal mindshare from Google, making the search giant appear flatfooted. But Google, which helped develop the transformer technology that powers generative AI models, has fired back, dedicating the bulk of its Google I/O conference in May to its AI developments.

YouTube ad sales fell 1.9pc to $7.1bn (¬£6.2bn) in the three months to 30 September, compared to a year earlier, in the latest sign of a slowdown in the global economy.

Alphabet, the owner of YouTube and Google, had been expected to report around $71bn (¬£61.9bn) in overall revenues for the period, or growth of around 12pc - but instead sales were $69.1bn. Profits of $13.9bn were also below what had been expected.

Shares fell 5.7pc in after-hours trading immediately after the results were unveiled, wiping around $7.6bn off one of the world‚Äôs biggest businesses.

It came as Microsoft revealed a slowdown in sales in its cloud computing arm, and the music streaming service Spotify announced that advertising revenue was growing more slowly than expected.

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet‚Äôs chief executive, said: ‚ÄúFinancial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in search and momentum in cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We‚Äôre working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.‚Äù

Alphabet‚Äôs share price has fallen 28pc since January, broadly tracking the wider technology markets, which have seen a steady sell-off during the year.

The company briefly dipped last week after Snapchat‚Äôs parent company Snap Inc reported slower-than-expected growth, triggering a 25pc crash in its own price during after-hours trading.

Microsoft posted overall sales of $50.1bn, comfortably above market expectations of $49.6bn. However, the slowdown in its increasingly important cloud computing division triggered a 2pc dip in the company‚Äôs share price.

Microsoft Azure, the cloud business, grew by 35pc year-on-year whereas analysts had expected to see growth of 40pc as the business world continues its shift to cloud computing.

The Redmond, Washington DC-headquartered company is also contending with the fallout of a global slowdown in PC sales, which are firmly linked to the company‚Äôs Windows computer operating system. Gartner figures show PC sales dropped 19.5pc during the past three months, the steepest decline ever tracked by the tech consulting company.

Microsoft‚Äôs market value stood at $1.87 trillion on Tuesday evening, a 27.5pc decrease from its $2.58 trillion all-time high in November 2021.

Microsoft‚Äôs share price has tracked the general slump in tech stocks, declining from December 2021‚Äôs $334.75 (¬£291.81) down to Tuesday‚Äôs closing price of $250 (¬£217), a decrease of just over a quarter.

The financial health of two of the most influential US tech companies is seen as a bellwether for the broader US economy, which has seen increasing storm clouds gather during 2022 amid fears of recession fuelled in part by rising inflation, the strength of the dollar and slowing business spending.

In a sign of consumer spending holding up, Spotify reported sales of more than ‚Ç¨3bn (¬£2.6bn) between July and September, with the number of average monthly users coming in at 456m, beating analyst estimates.

The company also predicted in July it would add another six million premium subscribers during the following three months, a target it beat by one million.

However, the Stockholm-based company warned that challenging economic conditions led to slower than expected growth in advertising revenue.

Spotify said third-quarter profit margins were less than it had expected, citing ‚Äúsome softness in advertising‚Äù, currency fluctuations and retroactive royalty payments to songwriters and music publishers.

Its net loss of ‚Ç¨228m came in above its own prediction of ‚Ç¨218m. Shares fell 4pc in after-market trading.",Google shares drop as YouTube suffers first ever fall in advertising sales,non-causal,"DC, US, PC","['S', 'U']",[],"['DC', 'PC', 'US']","['U', 'S', 'MCO', 'PC', 'DC', 'US']",0.99214715

RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

‚ÄúAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)t: Internet services leader Alphabet was a top detractor on market concerns about the global economic outlook. For its 3Q22 reported in October, the company reported disappointing advertising revenue, partially offset by better-than-expected results for its cloud business. The company reported third-quarter revenue of $69 billion, an increase of 6% year over year (11% on a currency neutral basis), with Google Services (mostly Advertising) up 2%, and Google Cloud up 38%. With its high margin business model (25% operating margin last quarter), continued strength across its core Search and YouTube franchises, and emerging strength in its still relatively small Cloud business, we continue to view Alphabet as among the best-positioned secular growth franchises in the market. Additionally, GOOG shares trade at a compelling 13x the Street‚Äôs 2023 EPS estimate (which includes an approximate 10% earnings drag from losses in its Other Bets and Google Cloud segments), significant discounts to both the S&P 500, and the Russell 1000 Growth Index.‚Äù

However, many people are left scratching their heads over how Tesla, a company whose mission is to consign the internal combustion engine to the history books, can be a less ethical investment than one that sells cigarettes. This is due to the fact that the ratings used by pension funds worldwide to decide if companies are ethically compliant, apparently defy common sense. Altria, which recently fired its LGBT diversity officer last year, and Tesla's board is mostly made of white men, have also been criticized for their lack of ethical and sustainable concerns. The tide is turning in America, where a backlash is gathering momentum and many large investors in Europe are afraid of criticising the current manifestation of the ESG agenda.",An ESG cottage industry is now profiting off the trend's popularity among pension funds,MO,Food & Beverage,Tobacco,Altria Group Inc,2023-05-23T16:20:00+00:00,2023-05-23,2023-05-23T16:20:00+00:00,[],"Ameriprise's AMP robust assets under management (AUM) balance and business restructuring initiatives are likely to keep aiding financials. Supported by a solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue with efficient capital deployment activities, thus enhancing shareholder value.

However, significant outflows in AMP‚Äôs Asset Management segment make us apprehensive. Moreover, steadily rising expenses are expected to hurt the bottom line to some extent.

Looking at its financials, the company‚Äôs net revenues (GAAP basis) witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% over the last five years (2018-2022). The momentum continued in the first quarter of 2023. AMP‚Äôs efforts to launch products are likely to keep supporting top-line growth in the quarters ahead. We project GAAP net revenues to grow at the rate of 10.5%, 7.3% and 4.3% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.

Moreover, Ameriprise has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations.

In November 2021, the company closed the deal to take over BMO Financial Group‚Äôs EMEA asset management operations, which are likely to bolster its wealth and asset management businesses and global diversification efforts. In 2019, Ameriprise divested the Ameriprise Auto & Home business. These initiatives are expected to further support revenue growth.

In April 2023, Ameriprise announced a dividend hike for the 16th time since 2010. In January 2022, its board of directors authorized an additional repurchase plan worth $3 billion (expiring on Mar 31, 2024). As of Mar 31, 2022, the company had $1.1 billion worth of shares left to be repurchased. Given its strong balance sheet position, it is expected to sustain efficient capital deployments.

However, analysts seem pessimistic regarding AMP‚Äôs earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised marginally lower over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Over the past year, shares of Ameriprise have gained 16.6% compared with the industry‚Äôs rise of 4.7%.

The company‚Äôs Asset Management segment, which remains one of the major sources of revenues (accounting for 21.6% of total adjusted operating net revenues in the first quarter of 2023), has been witnessing significant outflows. While the segment witnessed overall net inflows in 2020 and 2021, outflows are expected to continue in the quarters ahead amid a tough operating backdrop. This will likely continue to adversely impact the segment‚Äôs performance.

Further, while AMP's GAAP expenses declined in 2020, the same increased, witnessing a CAGR of 1.7% over the five-year period ended 2022. The uptrend persisted in the first quarter of 2023. Although the company‚Äôs initiatives to focus on cost management have resulted in controlled general and administrative expenses, overall costs are expected to remain elevated in the near term due to advertising campaigns, inflation, hiring and technology upgrades. Our estimates for GAAP expenses indicate a CAGR of 10.6% over the next three years.

A couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc. CASH and First Citizens BancShares FCNCA.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pathward Financial‚Äôs current-year earnings has been revised 1.8% upward over the past 30 days. Its shares have gained 3.6% in the past six months. Currently, CASH carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Conagra CAG -0.42%decrease; red down pointing triangle Brands said shoppers continued to stomach rising food prices, boosting the company‚Äôs margins and sales.

The maker of Slim Jim meat sticks and Chef Boyardee canned pasta said sales of its products rose in the quarter ended May 28. Volumes softened, but the pullback wasn‚Äôt enough to offset price increases.

The company continued to face rising costs for its own goods, even as broader inflation eases across the economy. Conagra said it expected slower sales growth of 1% in the next fiscal year because of persistent inflation.

Conagra‚Äôs total sales rose 2.2% to $2.97 billion, from $2.91 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected sales of $3 billion.

The Chicago-based consumer packaged goods company said its profit fell 77% to $36.3 million in the quarter, missing the $284 million forecast from analysts polled by FactSet.

Conagra said a brand impairment charge of $345 million ate into its profit in the quarter.

Conagra‚Äôs bump in revenue was driven by strength in its international sales, with price mix nearly 14% in its overseas markets. Sales of grocery and snack products edged up as well.

The company‚Äôs refrigerated and frozen foods division, which has previously been touted by the company as a bright spot if consumers pull back, saw a decline in sales compared with the previous year.

New data suggest that inflation of food products continues to slow. Labor Department data released Wednesday showed that food prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in June, down from 0.2% in May. Prices for at-home foods, which includes grocery products and packaged goods, were flat.

Conagra raised prices over the last year to catch up with inflation in the cost of its goods. Those pricing actions have had their benefits: Price increases more than offset a drop in the number of goods sold earlier in the year, causing the company‚Äôs profits to surge in the previous quarter.

Consumers may be losing patience with price increases on food. Competitor General Mills missed sales estimates as volumes eased, even as consumers spent more on the company‚Äôs products.

Conagra said it expected the cost of goods sold to continue to rise in the next fiscal year. It anticipates diluted earnings per share to rise to between $2.70 and $2.75 on an adjusted basis.

S&P 500 firms are expected to post a 9% drop in profits in the second quarter, making it the worst season since 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. In Europe, it may be even worse, with a projected 12% slump. But with the bar already low ‚Äî and some indicators suggesting an earnings recovery next year ‚Äî strategists are split on how the market will react.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm skeptical companies will be able to demonstrate the same degree of earnings resilience this quarter,‚Äù said Evgenia Molotova, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management. ‚ÄúTop-line growth and margin stability will be key to seeing whether profits will be able to rebound in the second half.‚Äù

Areas of focus for market watchers include the impact of a slumping dollar on big exporters to the US, the substance behind the artificial intelligence buzz that powered the stock rally this year, and clues about how much firms are being affected by higher costs and a consumer squeeze.

Here are five things investors are watching:

The frenzy around AI spurred the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 to its best ever first-half. Now, investors will be looking for evidence of the earnings implications of the nascent technology.

‚ÄúIf enthusiasm for AI fails to adequately materialize in technology companies‚Äô earnings, we could experience at least a temporary correction in share prices,‚Äù said Aneeka Gupta, director of macroeconomic research at WisdomTree.

The biggest technology stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. ‚Äî are expected to post the best earnings growth among US companies this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Signs of cooling inflation have stoked optimism that the Federal Reserve may be able to stop hiking rates soon. For companies, the news isn‚Äôt as positive because labor and other costs are still elevated, while they are struggling to raise prices for customers any further.

‚ÄúHeadline inflation has slowed faster than wages, which could help consumers, but hurt margins,‚Äù said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ‚ÄúWe will be watching the interaction of wage growth with price inflation for whether businesses remain under pressure.‚Äù

Nokia Oyj and restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. were among those warning about the impact of higher costs in early earnings reports.

Market participants said they‚Äôre focused on the tone around consumer spending and looking at auto sales and the travel and hospitality sector to assess the health of Corporate America. Another area of focus will be company debt loads and refinancing plans , especially for those with weaker balance sheets.

‚ÄúConsumers have propped up the US economy for months, spurred by a strong labor market and excess savings, so any evidence of belt tightening, trading down or fading spend on services will be key,‚Äù said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.

Adjusted for inflation, US consumer spending has largely stalled after surging at the start of the year, and some early signs from companies haven‚Äôt been good. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology Inc. said it expects a contraction in PC and smartphone markets and German chemicals giant BASF SE warned on profits, blaming slow demand for consumer products.

That means forecasts for a swift earnings rebound next year may be too optimistic and leave stocks vulnerable to a selloff if companies sound cautious, according to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson ‚Äî one of the most bearish voices on Wall Street.

European profits are expected to drop more than those in the US, because of weakness in the manufacturing sector, according to Barclays Plc strategists. Big exporters are also facing a further hurdle as currencies including the euro and Swiss franc strengthen. Watchmaker Swatch Group AG ‚Äî which has high fixed costs in Switzerland ‚Äî warned that currency shifts will weigh on sales this year.

The equity market began to reflect Europe‚Äôs challenges in the April-June period, when the Stoxx 600 underperformed the S&P 500 in dollar terms. While cheaper valuations have made regional stocks attractive again for some, others say a dearth of technology stocks could keep the outlook choppy.

China‚Äôs stock market has missed out on the global rally this year amid a weak economic rebound, deepening concerns about the property sector and surging youth unemployment.

Reports from the country‚Äôs automakers are expected to be a bright spot as domestic sales and exports gain momentum, while technology firms‚Äô results may be weak as global chip markets remain lackluster.

The stakes are also high for international firms with exposure to China, like Europe‚Äôs luxury giants. Burberry Group Plc said on Friday that demand in China helped to compensate for weakness in the US. Investor favorites LVMH and Kering SA ‚Äî which started to show some cracks earlier this year ‚Äî will also be scrutinized for their performance in Asia.

With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 is now up 3.4% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index‚Äôs gains.

Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500‚Äôs gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted.

The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. In his first public speech since taking office last month, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Tuesday it would be a ‚Äúdanger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions‚Äù and emphasized the importance to ‚Äúsupplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.‚Äù

However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year‚Äôs policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn‚Äôt comment on monetary policy.

Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank‚Äôs March 21-22 meeting.

The CEO of Chamber or Progress, which includes Apple, Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet and Meta among its corporate partners, sent the president a letter last week asking him to ‚Äúoffer a jobs and competitiveness plan‚Äù for the tech sector during his speech, according to a copy of the letter exclusively shared with The Hill.

‚ÄúTo help prevent a worsening economic cycle and to maintain U.S. competitiveness in tech during the current downturn, I urge your Administration to put forward a plan for tech sector recovery, job growth, and competitiveness,‚Äù Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich wrote.

The push from Chamber of Progress comes as Biden is reportedly expected to call for tougher regulations of tech giants, ramping up his support of efforts to rein in the power of the nation‚Äôs largest tech companies.

Biden‚Äôs speech will address antitrust enforcement, as well as a call for stronger privacy protections, The Washington Post reported. It follows an op-ed the president penned in The Wall Street Journal urging Congress to work together across the aisle on issues related to boosting competition and improving data privacy.

If Biden shares a message backing efforts to reform antitrust law, tech advocacy groups will likely cheer the decision.

Kyle Morse, deputy executive director of The Tech Oversight Project, said ‚Äúwe hope that President Biden will double down and galvanize Congress to pass tech accountability measures that will improve competition and rein in bad actors.‚Äù

‚ÄúTech oversight is widely popular and bipartisan. That‚Äôs why Big Tech and their allies spent a combined $230 million on TV ads and lobbying to kill off antitrust. When these bills come up for a vote, they pass by wide margins,‚Äù he said in an email.

The Chamber of Progress‚Äôs push for more help arrives after tech giants including Meta, Google and Amazon laid off or announced plans to lay off a combined 41,000 employees.

Kovacevich underscored the push for Biden to address growth in the tech sector by saying the ‚Äúconsequences of these layoffs‚Äù impact the broader communities during the ‚Äúperiod of time it takes displaced workers to find new jobs.‚Äù

‚ÄúPut simply, laid off tech workers mean less business for local coffee shops, restaurants, and furniture stores,‚Äù he wrote.

The plan should target investments in emerging technology, such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnology.","Biden needs to address sweeping tech layoffs, Big Tech backers say",non-causal,"CEO, TV, AI","['C', 'AMZN', 'CHRW', 'O', 'H']",[],"['TV', 'AI', 'CEO']","['C', 'AMZN', 'TV', 'FDX', 'CEO', 'CHRW', 'O', 'H', 'AI']",-0.75021964

Other than Apple , it was a brutal earnings week for Big Tech.

Alphabet , Amazon , Meta and Microsoft combined lost over $350 billion in market cap after offering concerning commentary for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Between slowing revenue growth ‚Äî or declines in Meta's case ‚Äî and efforts to control costs, the tech giants have found themselves in an unfamiliar position after unbridled growth in the past decade.

Third-quarter results this week came against the backdrop of soaring inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession. Apple bucked the trend after beating expectations for revenue and profit. The stock on Friday had its best day in over two years.

On the opposite end of the spectrum was Meta, which has seen its stock price collapse in 2022. Facebook's parent came up short on earnings, recorded its lowest average revenue per user in two years and said sales in the fourth quarter will likely decline for a third straight period.

""There are a lot of things going on right now in the business and in the world, and so it's hard to have a simple 'We're going to do this one thing, and that's going to solve all the issues,'"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday.

Meta's stock had its worst week since the company's IPO in 2012, plunging 24% over the past five days. Microsoft fell 2.6% for the week, due to a 7.7% decline on Wednesday after the company gave weak guidance for the year-end period and missed estimates for cloud revenue.

Things were also bleak at Amazon, which dropped 13%. A gloomy fourth-quarter forecast along with a dramatic slowdown in its cloud-computing unit were largely to blame for the selloff.

While Amazon Web Services saw expansion slow to 27.5% from 33% in the prior period, Google's cloud group, which is significantly smaller, sped up to almost 38% growth from around 36%. Google plans to keep spending in cloud even as it intends to rein in headcount overall growth in the next few quarters.

""We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption, and we continue to invest accordingly,"" Ruth Porat, Alphabet CFO, said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. ""We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability.""

However, results from the rest of Google parent Alphabet were less impressive. The company's core advertising business grew just slightly, and YouTube's ad revenue dropped from the prior year. The reverse was true for Amazon, which is playing catchup to Google and Facebook in digital advertising. In Amazon's ad business, revenue growth accelerated to 30% from 21%, topping analysts' estimates.

""Advertisers are looking for effective advertising, and our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend,"" said Brian Olsavsky, the company's finance chief. ""We have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers.""

Analyst Aaron Kessler at Raymond James lowered his price target on Amazon stock to $130 from $164 after the results. But he maintained his equivalent of a buy rating on the stock and said the company's ""robust advertising growth"" has the potential to help Amazon fatten up its margin.

As investors continue to rotate away from tech, they're finding money-making opportunities in other parts of the market that had previously lagged behind software and internet names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% this week, the fourth weekly gain in a row for the index. Prior to 2021, the Dow had underperformed the Nasdaq for five straight years.

Morgan Stanley said in a note that rising interest rates and elevated inflation, as well as a worsening earnings outlook, bodes poorly for stocks. However, we prefer to get our read on the economy from actual companies' results rather than simply economic data. To that end, we still like the industrial stocks here. Secondarily, we also like pharma and non-discretionary consumer goods companies. A couple of our Club names are Emerson Electric (EMR), our newest position started last week, and Humana (HUM). 2. Believing in Amazon We bought 50 shares of Amazon (AMZN) on Monday, emboldened by the oversold market and the company's ability to improve performance if it gets aggressive with layoffs. Analysts at Atlantic Equities said in a Monday note that Amazon could deliver year-over-year margin growth in the first half of next year, citing opportunities for the company to expand and stabilize e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) margins, respectively. While we do worry that Amazon is a part of the down-turning Big Tech group, we believe it can fight the tide. 3. Still bullish on Eli Lilly The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added Eli Lilly 's (LLY) new type-2 diabetes drug Mounjaro to its list of drugs in short supply , highlighting strong demand for the medication. Mounjaro's promise as an obesity treatment, a possible additional indication in trials now, is at the heart of our bull case for the stock. Despite this shortage now, we know that Eli Lilly plans to double its manufacturing capacity next year and that demand could be off the charts if regulators approve Mounjaro for obesity.

It‚Äôs no secret that tech and media workers bounce around companies. But Snap seems to have a keen interest in Google employees as it navigates the choppy waters of unprofitability.

Snap, the parent company to Snapchat, named a new managing director of its India operations on Wednesday. It appointed Pulkit Trivedi, former director of Google Pay who spent nine years with the company. And Trivedi isn‚Äôt the first high-ranking Googler to jump ship for Snap in recent months.

In June, Snap scooped Eric Young, Google‚Äôs vice president of engineering for Google Cloud. He became senior vice president of engineering at the social media company. Two months prior, Google‚Äôs Darshan Kantak joined Snap as senior vice president of revenue products. He previously managed search ads as vice president of product management at Google.

The hires are part of a larger recruitment effort on Snap‚Äôs part to turn its business around. In addition to recruiting from Google in recent months, Snap has also pulled Microsoft‚Äôs global head of advertising and a Meta vice president. Snap is hiring for 114 positions, the majority of which are engineering and sales roles, according to its jobs page. Those hires would add to its headcount of 5,300, which is down 18% from the same time last year.

While media companies across the board have taken losses from the post-COVID advertising downturn, Snap was hit especially hard. It lost $1.43 billion last year, triple its losses from the year prior. The company, which has traditionally relied on advertising revenue to turn a profit, is toying with paid subscriptions and an A.I. chatbot to earn a buck and keep its app relevant. But recent earnings results don‚Äôt show any major improvements. Snap has never reported an annual profit since it went public in 2017, and its stock has been hovering around the same $10 price for the last year, a fraction of its $83 peak in 2021.

Snap‚Äôs most recent hire in Trivedi signals the growth opportunities Snap sees in the Indian market. The company has 200 million monthly active users in the country, doubling in less than two years and representing one-quarter of its total monthly active users, according to Snap reports published earlier this year.

While India presents opportunity, it is also one of the toughest regulatory environments for social media companies. With Trivedi‚Äôs hire, Snap restructured its reporting system in the country, giving India‚Äôs leaders a bigger say, according to TechCrunch. Trivedi will oversee all of India‚Äôs local operations, including revenue, content, and creator partnerships, Snap told TechCrunch. He will report to Ajit Mohan, Meta‚Äôs former managing director of India who defected last year.

Dennis Itumbi told the Star newspaper that he had noticed ‚Äúincreased activity‚Äù on his Telegram last year but called it ‚Äúinconsequential‚Äù.

The admission followed the publication of an investigation by the Guardian and 29 media partners into the activities of a hacking and disinformation specialist named Tal Hanan, a former Israeli special forces operative who with a team of associates sells his services in order to sway democratic elections.

The investigation found that Hanan used hacking techniques to get into the Telegram and Gmail accounts of political advisers close to Ruto, including Itumbi, before last year‚Äôs election.

The hacking of Itumbi and two other political advisers close to Ruto did not stop Ruto from winning the poll, but the involvement of figures such as Hanan highlights the potential risk to new democratic systems.

Hanan demonstrated his hacking skills to undercover reporters posing as consultants in a series of meetings last summer, which were secretly recorded by the journalists.

Hanan never explicitly confirmed he had been hired to work in Kenya, or if so who his client might have been, but in his demonstration to the reporters he targeted two Telegram accounts and one Gmail account linked to pro-Ruto advisers.

In a statement about the investigation, Hanan said: ‚ÄúI deny any wrongdoing.‚Äù

The revelations about the hacking of Ruto strategists made headlines on local news across Kenya. Initial disputes around the election results were dismissed by Kenya‚Äôs supreme court but Raila Odinga, the veteran opposition politician defeated in last year‚Äôs election, has continued to challenge Ruto‚Äôs victory.

The reaction to the revelations among the political class has been tepid, in part because the national focus has shifted away from politics and to economic challenges. Many ordinary people have become tired of repeated contestation of successive polls in the country.

In a separate development, Odinga appears to have sought to pre-empt questions about the involvement of Israeli mercenaries in the election by claiming that he hired ‚Äúethical hackers‚Äù to try to provide him with evidence that last year‚Äôs poll was rigged.

Odinga, the leader of the Azimio coalition, was declared to have lost narrowly to Ruto and has since repeatedly alleged that he won by a significant margin. He has made similar claims after a series of electoral defeats over the last decade, and for his claims about the 2022 poll he has previously relied on the testimony of a supposed whistleblower from within Kenya‚Äôs electoral commission, as well as supposed internal documents. This evidence has been dismissed by Kenya‚Äôs supreme court and independent experts.

‚ÄúI had to look for ethical hackers to know the truth,‚Äù Odinga told a Kenyan TV network, according to a report on Monday in the Citizen newspaper.

The GF Value of Becton, Dickinson and Co, calculated at $254.35, suggests that the company's stock is modestly overvalued. The GF Value is an innovative tool that assesses a stock's intrinsic worth based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on past performance and growth, and estimates of future business performance. If the stock price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, as in the case of Becton, Dickinson and Co, the stock is considered overvalued, and its future returns may be lower than its business growth.

Investing in companies with strong financial health reduces the risk of permanent capital loss. Becton, Dickinson and Co's financial strength is rated as fair with a score of 5 out of 10. Its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.11 is lower than 92.46% of companies in the Medical Devices & Instruments industry, indicating the need for careful evaluation before investment.

Profitability is another critical factor to consider. Becton, Dickinson and Co has demonstrated consistent profitability over the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 13.16%, which is better than 71.2% of companies in the industry. Its Earnings Per Share (EPS) stand at $5.33.

Growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. However, Becton, Dickinson and Co's 3-year average revenue growth rate lags behind 67.08% of companies in the Medical Devices & Instruments industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 1.2%, ranking lower than 61.69% of companies in the industry, suggesting room for improvement.

Comparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to assess profitability and value creation. Becton, Dickinson and Co's ROIC stands at 5, slightly lower than its WACC of 5.3, indicating a need for better capital efficiency.

In conclusion, while Becton, Dickinson and Co's stock appears to be modestly overvalued, the company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks lower than a majority of companies in the Medical Devices & Instruments industry.

‚Ä¢ Rabois told an Evercore-hosted event that firms like Meta over-hired by thousands of staff.
‚Ä¢ ""There's nothing for these people to do ... It's all fake work,"" Rabois said.

Thousands of tech staffers at Meta and Google do ""fake work"" and were brought on to fulfill the ""vanity metric"" of hiring, according to outspoken investor and tech veteran Keith Rabois.

Rabois is chief executive of OpenStore, which finances merchants selling with Shopify, and a general partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund. He is also known as one of the ""PayPal Mafia"", having worked as an executive at the payments firm in the early 2000s.

Speaking remotely from Miami at an event hosted by banking firm Evercore, he called out major tech firms for over-hiring and said the sector's current mass shedding of jobs to rein in costs was overdue.

""All these people were extraneous, this has been true for a long time, the vanity metric of hiring employees was this false god in some ways,"" he said.

Later on the call, he estimated that Alphabet's Google and Facebook owner Meta had thousands of employees who don't do anything.

""There's nothing for these people to do ‚Äî they're really ‚Äî it's all fake work,"" he said. ""Now that's being exposed, what do these people actually do, they go to meetings.""

Google, he continued, had intentionally over-hired engineers and tech talent to stop them from other companies, a strategy he described as ""pretty coherent."" But, he added, that meant engineers had been happy to ""be entitled, sit at their desks, and do nothing.""

Rabois view is shared by other Silicon Valley figures such as Marc Andreessen, the Andreessen Horowitz general partner who has criticized a managerial ""laptop class"", and likewise thinks firms are overstaffed.

Rabois expects the industry's focus to shift away from a growth-at-all-costs model to focus on profitability metrics such as revenue generated per employee. Rabois noted that cutting headcount was one of the best ways to preserve and generate free cash flow.

The comments come as soaring interest rates and inflation in recent months have led tech companies across the industry to take an ax to their workforces in a bid to manage costs and weather the economic storm. In 2022, more than 1,000 companies laid off more than 160,000 staff, according to the layoffs tracking site Layoffs.fyi. That figure has already surpassed 100,000 for 2023 so far, according to the site.

The job losses mark the first major contraction for the tech sector after a decade of growth that supercharged several of the major firms to market capitalizations above $1 trillion ‚Äî and kept talent from smaller companies and industries.

Despite already reducing headcounts, some firms are set to make more cuts. Meta, which laid off more than 11,000 workers in November, could be preparing to ax thousands more jobs this week, according to Bloomberg.

Rabois was full of praise for Twitter CEO Elon Musk, who is estimated to have cut roughly half of the social media company's workforce a month after taking charge in October.

""People are watching Elon and Twitter and he's clearly setting an example ‚Äî maybe it's an extreme example,"" Rabois said, adding later that he wouldn't bet against the Tesla mogul.

Not everyone agrees with Musk's methods, and his drastic cuts have occasionally come back to bite him. Twitter has experienced safety and security issues since Musk took over, including a major outage earlier this week. He is also under fire for trolling laid-off Twitter employee Haraldur Thorleifsson and accusing him of using his disability as an ""excuse"" not to do work.","Google and Meta over-hired thousands of employees who do 'fake work,' says PayPal Mafia's Keith Rabois",causal,"VC, CEO","['CHIPS', 'U', 'UGB', 'S', 'A']",[],"['CEO', 'VC']","['CHIPS', 'U', 'UGB', 'S', 'ADI', 'CEO', 'VC', 'A']",-0.99994296

Benchmark 10-year government bond yields in Australia and New Zealand fell, following Treasuries. A rally in long-dated US government debt inverted a closely watched section of the yield curve by the biggest margin in four decades, underscoring investor concern about the risk of recession.

The moves followed the biggest increase in eight months for US retail sales, outpacing estimates and indicating Fed tightening has further to run to stymie inflation.

1,good,True,positive,48713,"Newmont Corporation (NEM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. Shares of the gold and copper miner have returned -18.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1% change. The company's earnings estimate of $2.45 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.4%, while the consensus earnings estimate has changed +2.7%, and for the next fiscal year, the consensus sales estimate for the company is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share. This suggests that a higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. The Zacks Rank is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

In fact, India has been one of the top plastic polluters in the world.

In 2020-21, India generated nearly 3.5 million tons of plastic, according to government figures.

From July 1, 2022, several single-use plastic items were officially banned in India, but the failure to enforce them has meant that most of these products are back in circulation.



A five-year analysis of plastic pollution around the world has found that food packaging, household products and other packaging material accounted for the most plastic waste generated in India.

The 2022 Brand Audit analysis by 'Break Free From Plastic' looked into pollution data from around the world in the past five years.

It found that PepsiCo (19093 pieces) CG Foods India Pvt Ltd (8420 pieces) and Perfitti Van Melle (7813 pieces) were the top three plastic polluters in India in 2022.

In 2021, the Karnataka Milk Federation ( KMF) was the biggest plastic polluter in India, while it was Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Producers' Federation Ltd in 2020.

SS food products and Perfitti Van melle were responsible for the most plastic pollution in India in 2019 and 2018 respectively.

PET is the most wasted plastic in India

PET (20376 pieces) HDPE (3000 pieces) and PVC (169 pieces) were the most common plastic waste types in India this year.

This has remained unchanged in India between 2018-22.

How the data was collected

The report said that the data from India was collected by 24 organisations that conducted 98 events in 34 cities to document more than two lakh (201543) plastic items.

While PepsiCo was the biggest plastic polluter in India, its biggest rival Coca-Cola Company, which is also a sponsor of the ongoing COP27 in Egypt was the top globally.

The top 10 global corporate plastic polluters according to our analysis of five years of the brand audit are The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Nestl√©, Unilever, Mondelƒìz International, Mars, Inc., Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris International, Danone, and Ferrero Group, the report said.

Coca-Cola had more waste than next top polluters combined

Since 2018, global cleanups and brand audits have been carried out by more than 200,000 volunteers in 87 countries and territories to identify the companies polluting the most places with the most plastic waste.

It noted that the top polluters are also the top producers, according to data from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment.

Between 2018-2022, the same FMCG companies continue to dominate the list, with The Coca-Cola Company standing out as the clear top polluter by a significant margin over all five years.

Between 2018 and 2022 more Coca-Cola Company branded items were collected than the next two top polluters combined.

From 2018-2022, brand audits collected 85,035 Coca-Cola Company branded products. During the same time period, brand audits collected 50,558 PepsiCo branded products and 27,008 Nestl√© branded products.

‚ÄúInstead of allowing companies like Coke to greenwash their image, governments need to compel polluters to invest in reuse and alternative product delivery systems that avoid the problem in the first place. This is one of the key systemic changes required for the world to avert the full consequences of climate change and plastic pollution,‚Äù Von Hernandez, Global Coordinator, of Break Free From Plastic said.

The report has recommended that top polluting companies must reveal their total global plastic footprints, and reduce them by ending their reliance on single-use packaging, and redesigning their products and delivery systems for refill and reuse.



To government representatives at the first Global Plastic Treaty negotiation meeting: Considering the failing voluntary commitments of many of the major plastic polluting companies, the Break Free From Plastic movement is calling for an ambitious, legally-binding Global Plastics Treaty.

YouTube ad sales fell 1.9pc to $7.1bn (¬£6.2bn) in the three months to 30 September, compared to a year earlier, in the latest sign of a slowdown in the global economy.

Alphabet, the owner of YouTube and Google, had been expected to report around $71bn (¬£61.9bn) in overall revenues for the period, or growth of around 12pc - but instead sales were $69.1bn. Profits of $13.9bn were also below what had been expected.

Shares fell 5.7pc in after-hours trading immediately after the results were unveiled, wiping around $7.6bn off one of the world‚Äôs biggest businesses.

It came as Microsoft revealed a slowdown in sales in its cloud computing arm, and the music streaming service Spotify announced that advertising revenue was growing more slowly than expected.

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet‚Äôs chief executive, said: ‚ÄúFinancial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in search and momentum in cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We‚Äôre working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.‚Äù

Alphabet‚Äôs share price has fallen 28pc since January, broadly tracking the wider technology markets, which have seen a steady sell-off during the year.

The company briefly dipped last week after Snapchat‚Äôs parent company Snap Inc reported slower-than-expected growth, triggering a 25pc crash in its own price during after-hours trading.

Microsoft posted overall sales of $50.1bn, comfortably above market expectations of $49.6bn. However, the slowdown in its increasingly important cloud computing division triggered a 2pc dip in the company‚Äôs share price.

Microsoft Azure, the cloud business, grew by 35pc year-on-year whereas analysts had expected to see growth of 40pc as the business world continues its shift to cloud computing.

The Redmond, Washington DC-headquartered company is also contending with the fallout of a global slowdown in PC sales, which are firmly linked to the company‚Äôs Windows computer operating system. Gartner figures show PC sales dropped 19.5pc during the past three months, the steepest decline ever tracked by the tech consulting company.

Microsoft‚Äôs market value stood at $1.87 trillion on Tuesday evening, a 27.5pc decrease from its $2.58 trillion all-time high in November 2021.

Microsoft‚Äôs share price has tracked the general slump in tech stocks, declining from December 2021‚Äôs $334.75 (¬£291.81) down to Tuesday‚Äôs closing price of $250 (¬£217), a decrease of just over a quarter.

The financial health of two of the most influential US tech companies is seen as a bellwether for the broader US economy, which has seen increasing storm clouds gather during 2022 amid fears of recession fuelled in part by rising inflation, the strength of the dollar and slowing business spending.

In a sign of consumer spending holding up, Spotify reported sales of more than ‚Ç¨3bn (¬£2.6bn) between July and September, with the number of average monthly users coming in at 456m, beating analyst estimates.

The company also predicted in July it would add another six million premium subscribers during the following three months, a target it beat by one million.

However, the Stockholm-based company warned that challenging economic conditions led to slower than expected growth in advertising revenue.

Spotify said third-quarter profit margins were less than it had expected, citing ‚Äúsome softness in advertising‚Äù, currency fluctuations and retroactive royalty payments to songwriters and music publishers.

Its net loss of ‚Ç¨228m came in above its own prediction of ‚Ç¨218m.

Roanna Korling has revealed the secrets to her success after starting selling items on eBay in 2001.

Originally the mum began flogging her unwanted Pearl Jam CDs online as a way of getting some extra cash alongside her day job.

Now, she has a team of employees and it has become her full-time work.

At first, she would set herself a ¬£200 budget and then go out searching for things she could sell for a profit.

She‚Äôd go to TK Maxx and pick up ¬£30 designer handbags which she‚Äôd sell for ¬£80 and would visit markets to see what she could find.

On one trip, she even bought up a bulk of belly dancing outfits which were then listed online.

Roanna told the Mirror: ""Things took off from there really - I was selling everything from perfumes to exchange store clothing. I'd visit brand warehouses and buy remnant stock to sell online.

‚ÄúBefore listing, I would cut the labels off and then sell them on for a small profit.

""Often, I'd fill entire suitcases with stock - but the thing is, it wasn't making me much money and the relisting process was becoming exhausting.""

She kept at her day job and continued to manage her side hustle until 2015 when she decided it was time to take the plunge and start her family.

Roanna said: ""In 2015, I handed my notice in and walked out to pursue exactly this. I wanted flexibility and the freedom to start a family - and I knew it wouldn't be possible with my daily commute into London.""

She began to go to trade show where she‚Äôd build up her contacts with suppliers, some of which she still uses.

As well, she started focusing her items on rockabilly, punk and fashion from the 1950s, because she had found out these were hard to track down and spotted a gap in the market.

Out of her hard work, Ro Rox Boutique was formed.

At first, she would place small orders of around eight items in different sizes each for about ¬£250 and then do her research by using eBay to find out how much she could sell each product for in order to make a profit.

She says once you have found something that works you need ‚Äútime and dedication‚Äù adding the more time you have, the more items you can put online and start to grow. Roanna also says ‚Äúnot to be greedy‚Äù and start off low and expect just a small profit margin. That initial success will spur you on. As well, she advises to ‚Äúsell in quantities‚Äù. The trick, she claims is to sell as much as possible. Try and be specific too. If there is a lot of competition about, the less chance you have of making a sale. Try to offer items no one else has. Also, start your auctions at 99p ‚Äì at least at first. According to Roanna, Ebay algorithms mean buyers are less likely to see items that have a high starting price, so start off low. Find a memorable name as shoppers will remember it and hopefully keep returning for more.

Things took off and now the company is selling around 1,300 items a week on eBay and their website.

After four years, Roanna and her partner, Martin, now have a warehouse in New Malden, South London and employ four people to manage their sales and transactions.

They have also formed partnerships with factories around the world who produce their own designs.

Their take on Michael Jackson‚Äôs Parade jacket is so far their biggest seller, having been bought by Ant & Dec, Strictly Come Dancing performers and X-Factor stars.

Roanna, from Cobham, Surrey, has just given birth to her second child, who is now six months old.

She said not having to take maternity leave has been a huge help.

Husband Martin currently runs the warehouse on a daily basis while she takes care of her kids at home.

While that likely means more pain for retail stocks, new Wall Street research suggests club holding Amazon (AMZN) is consumers' most preferred online shopping platform, buttressing the Club's long-term belief in the e-commerce giant. Consumer spending was flat month-over-month in September, according to an estimate of retail sales for the month provided by the Commerce Department on Friday. But those figures were not adjusted for inflation, indicating that consumer spending on retail actually fell last month. The retail sales data came on the back of the latest consumer price index survey , which showed consumer prices rose 0.4% in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday, all but ensuring another 75 basis point interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month. Meanwhile, a consumer survey from the University of Michigan showed inflation expectations were increasing, sending stocks lower Friday. The S & P 500 closed down more than 2%. The Wall Street view In this environment of rising prices, Baird surveyed roughly 1,000 online shoppers, with a majority saying they plan to spend less on holiday purchases this year compared to last year. But while consumers are tempering their discretionary budgets this holiday season, Amazon remains their shopping platform of choice, according to Baird. Amazon is the ""clear leader"" in the online shopping internet space among U.S. consumers, capturing almost 60% of market share, Baird analysts wrote in a research note Friday. In a separate note Thursday, Cowen said its shopping survey of Gen Z and Millennials showed Amazon to be their ""most preferred"" shopping website. Respondents said speed of delivery and convenience were key factors for shopping on Amazon, outweighing price concerns, according to analysts at Cowen. The new research comes the same week as Amazon's two-day Prime Early Access Sale , the initial results of which showed that while Amazon may remain a top online retail destination it's not immune from inflationary pressures. Amazon said Prime members bought more than 100 million items during the sales event, compared to the record 300 million items purchased during Amazon's July Prime Day event. Bank of America estimated Amazon's sales event brought in $8 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV), down 25% from July's $10.7 billion in GMV, according to a research note published Friday. Shares of Amazon, which have fallen more than 35% year-to-date, closed down 5% Friday, at $106.9 a share. The Club take We're happy to see that Amazon is the preferred platform for consumer shopping ‚Äî but we also know its so much more than that. For example, its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, consistently posts robust revenue growth and delivers high profit margins, allowing us to be bullish on the company despite growing macroeconomic headwinds. Furthermore, Amazon's nascent agreement with the National Football League to stream ""Thursday Night Football"" on Prime Video has attracted a record number of Prime signups and should support advertising revenue growth.

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 1.19% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.29%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the internet search leader had gained 9.85% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.49% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.06% in that time.

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Alphabet as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 2, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Alphabet to post earnings of $1.17 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 23.53%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $63.22 billion, up 2.14% from the year-ago period.

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

A month after completing his acquisition of Twitter, his iconoclastic gaze appears to be trained on the entire city. Mr Musk wants to build a super-app. Whether called ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe everything app‚Äù or ‚ÄúX‚Äù, his plans are still super-vague. A series of slides containing hardly any information tweeted on November 26th did little to shed light on his plans. Doting references to Tencent‚Äôs WeChat provide some clues‚Äîearlier this year Mr Musk described the Chinese super-app as ‚ÄúTwitter, plus PayPal, plus a whole bunch of other things, and all rolled into one with actually a great interface‚Äù. What is clear is that Mr Musk will face obstacles in his path.

A Twitter super-app would join a growing field. Launched in 2011, WeChat rode the wave of Chinese smartphone adoption. Today it boasts 1.3bn users and stunning ubiquity. Adding payments, e-commerce and gaming capabilities on top of its messaging platform made the app wildly popular. The launch of ‚Äúmini programs‚Äù, the millions of third-party applications which exist within WeChat-proper, in 2017 cemented the platform as the real operating system of the Chinese internet. There is no shortage of super-app-building across other developing economies. In South-East Asia Grab competes with GoTo, formed by a tie-up between Gojek, a ride-hailing giant, and Tokopedia, an online marketplace. Both have lost over half of their market value this year, but the concept remains a resilient one. So much so that India‚Äôs richest man, Gautam Adani, recently indicated plans to get in on the act, too.

The idea is not new. Super-app ambitions have been a staple of buzzy management presentations at American firms for years. Even Walmart touted plans to develop one. Most involve fitting as many closely related services inside the same app as possible. PayPal, a payments-giant, and Uber, a ride-hailing and delivery firm, have attempted to build narrower sector champions rather than WeChat-equivalents. These limits have not always been self-imposed. Investors have balked at attempts to push boundaries much further. When details of PayPal‚Äôs talks to take a $45bn leap into e-commerce by purchasing Pinterest, another marketplace, leaked last year, its shares plunged and the discussions were quickly abandoned. Such conglomerate-building activity would be even less acceptable to shareholders today. Mr Musk, who took Twitter private, will have no public-market investors attempting to clip his wings, but he will face more fundamental challenges if he seriously wishes to pursue a super-app strategy.

The greatest impediment to super-apps are, unsurprisingly, app stores. Apple, which makes more than half of America‚Äôs smartphones, is the incumbent gatekeeper to the country‚Äôs eyeballs. It guards this position jealously, and with good reason. The total fees it collects from its app store are not disclosed but are thought to make up a large chunk of a services segment with revenues of $78bn a year. This infrastructure, including a remarkably successful run in the payments business since the launch of Apple Pay in 2014, is the closest thing America has to a true super-app.

Mr Musk has already hit his head on this ceiling. In November he used a dispute over Apple‚Äôs advertising on his site to complain about the fees Apple extracts from apps doing business in its ecosystem (a ‚Äúsecret 30% tax‚Äù, as he put it). Mr Musk is far from the first mogul to gripe about this skimming, but it will be a particularly unwelcome squeeze on the profit margins of Twitter‚Äôs new subscription-based model. After meeting Tim Cook, Apple‚Äôs boss, at the firm‚Äôs headquarters in Cupertino, Mr Musk came away placated. But the skirmish is unlikely to be the last if Mr Musk follows through with his plans: any attempt to expand Twitter to integrate a payments system or create a platform for ‚Äúmini programs‚Äù to run within the app would ignite a more fundamental conflict. It is, however, a battle that Mr Musk would be likely to lose. Twitter will need to be far bigger before it can begin giving orders to the rule-makers. By contrast it is hard to imagine WeChat‚Äôs users abandoning the app if it was removed from Apple‚Äôs iPhones in China.

Larger platforms are more capable of becoming super-apps and of standing up to Apple. According to The Information, a news website, Microsoft has considered building its own super-app, a platform combining shopping, messaging and web search that would dip further into consumers‚Äô wallets as its business customers slow spending. Maybe Meta can rise to the challenge even as investors demand a halt to its Metaverse ambitions, the logic behind which was presumably to bypass the Apple ecosystem in the first place. Facebook‚Äôs parent company has begun to integrate the firm‚Äôs social-media properties and WhatsApp, a messaging service, is rolling out payments services in India and Brazil. Consolidation of such a sprawling estate is likely to be a quicker route to super-app success than the organic approach Mr Musk would have to take given his firm‚Äôs crippling debt burden.

Have faith in me

Another obstacle is trust. The concentration implicit in the super-app model requires trust from regulators, consumers and the developers who choose to operate their businesses within a platform. Regulators may welcome Mr Musk‚Äôs iconoclastic approach to Big Tech and the creation of another large platform. Consumers will be trickier to win over. Of all the potential cornerstones to a digital life, Mr Musk‚Äôs Twitter is hardly a compelling prospect: it is neither as vast as Meta nor as staid as Microsoft.

Persuading firms to partner with Twitter or participate in any ‚Äúmini programs‚Äù platform Mr Musk might create could be harder still. Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover of Twitter so far has come with lots of drama and erratic policymaking, which briefly spooked large advertisers. If Mr Musk is to make the transition from rule-breaker to rule-maker, he will need to defy both the business challenges to his super-app ambitions and expectations of what he might do as the boss of one.

Equity futures for Japan and Hong Kong fell as declines for the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 wiped out gains from the previous session. Australia‚Äôs market opened slightly higher and US futures edged up.

Benchmark 10-year government bond yields in Australia and New Zealand fell, following Treasuries. A rally in long-dated US government debt inverted a closely watched section of the yield curve by the biggest margin in four decades, underscoring investor concern about the risk of recession.

The moves followed the biggest increase in eight months for US retail sales, outpacing estimates and indicating Fed tightening has further to run to stymie inflation. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said a pause in rate hikes was ‚Äúoff the table,‚Äù and New York Fed President John Williams said the central bank should avoid incorporating financial stability risks into its considerations.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased its forecast for peak US interest rates to 5.25% at the top of the range, up from the previous call 5%.

‚ÄúEvery time equity and bond markets are thinking the Fed is done and start taking off in a rally, the Fed gets out and starts talking that back down again,‚Äù Cheryl Smith, economist and portfolio manager for Trillium Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television.

Here are highlights from Friday‚Äôs Analyst Blog:

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., The Procter & Gamble Co. and Linde plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today‚Äôs research reports here >>>



Alphabet shares have outperformed the broader market this year (+36.3% vs. +18.9% for the S&P 500 index), though they have performed essentially in-line with the Zacks Tech sector. The company‚Äôs strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.



Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Also, Alphabet‚Äôs expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Its growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. We expect to hear more about the company's AI efforts on the Q2 earnings call on July 25th.



However, sluggishness in the company‚Äôs advertisement business remains a major headwind. Also, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.

Shares of Procter & Gamble have modestly outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past six months (+8.1% vs. +7.2%). The company continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Also, sales and earnings grew year over year.



The company‚Äôs organic sales grew, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. It has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. Consequently, it raised the sales view to 1% growth compared with our estimate of a 1.1% rise for fiscal 2023.



However, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation. As a result, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023. Also, an unfavorable currency has been concerning.

Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+35.6% vs. +14.9%). The company is making the world more productive by the day with wide range of applications for its industrial gases. Linde‚Äôs primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.



Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.



However, declining free cashflow is a concern, reflecting weakness in operating activities. Moreover, the company is extremely vulnerable to uncertainty associated with the slowdown of economic growth, as this could hurt demand for its industrial gases.

TD SYNNEX enables enterprise customers from 60 additional global markets, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay to gain access to its cloud experts and solution portfolio incorporated with Google Cloud‚Äôs capabilities in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, infrastructure, collaboration and many more things. This will enable the business partners to generate positive business outcomes in the cloud market. The GOOGL Cloud solutions, devices and cloud infrastructure will enable enterprise clients to create new core competencies and boost business growth.

Alphabet‚Äôs Google Cloud provides users with a suite of cloud computing services that businesses can use to enhance productivity and workflow. It comprises Google‚Äôs infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Currently, it has 29 cloud regions and 88 availability zones. With the latest move, TD SYNNEX not only strengthens its existing partnership with Google Cloud, but also increases scalability and enhances its global reach.

SNX offers extensive resources to support organizations in building cloud practices and delivering cloud offerings, including Cloud Practice Builder programs, Rapid Risk Security Assessments, Google Cloud Migration Assessments, and a growing roster of professional and managed services. Coupled with Google Cloud offerings, devices and cloud infrastructure, TD SYNNEX positions partners to grow new core competencies and accelerate business growth.

SNX continues to witness strong demand for its technology products and services. A steady IT spending environment, backed by rapid digital transformations, is its upside. During third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company‚Äôs revenues jumped 194.9% year over year to $15.36 billion. This was driven by the inclusion of revenues from 2021‚Äôs merger of Tech Data Corporation.

However, TD SYNNEX‚Äôs near-term growth prospects are likely to be hurt as organizations push back their investments in big and expensive technology products on growing global slowdown concerns amid the present macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Persistent inflationary pressure resulting to a substantial increase in component costs and wage is anticipated to hurt the company‚Äôs profitability in the next few quarters.

TD SYNNEX and Alphabet currently carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of SNX and GOOGL have decreased 14.8% and 38.3%, respectively, in the past year.

Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market stays resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.

A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. However, first-quarter 2023 earnings of corporate America are better-than-expected so far. In its May FOMC meeting, the Fed refrained from giving any clearcut signal regarding the end of the current rate hike regime.

Investors remain directionless about the future trajectory of the U.S. stock movement. In such a situation, a good investment strategy can provide strong returns in the long term.

First, select U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital > $50 billion) with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have an excellent business model, globally acclaimed brand value and a sound financial position. Second, select those corporate bigwigs that have flourished year to date with robust potential for the rest of 2023 and the long term (next 3 to 5 years).

Based on the above-mentioned methodology, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants. These stocks have long-term earnings growth potential higher than the expected earnings growth of 10.7% for the broad-market S&P 500 Index. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today‚Äôs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

Meta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking.

However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in the emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world‚Äôs second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.

Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platform has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.6% and 19.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.6% over the last 30 days. Meta Platform has a long-term earnings growth potential of 19.5%. The stock price of META has jumped 93.7% year to date.

NVIDIA Corp. NVDA is gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA.

A collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to enhance NVDA‚Äôs presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment‚Äôs revenues to witness a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025.

Zacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10% and 34.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. NVIDIA has a long-term earnings growth potential of 17.5%. The stock price of NVDA has soared 97.6% year to date.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN‚Äôs cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining momentum among customers.

Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN‚Äôs strong global presence and solid momentum across small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect 2023 revenues to be up 5% from 2022.

Zacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last 30 days. Amazon has a long-term earnings growth potential of 18.4%. The stock price of AMZN has advanced 31.2% year to date.

Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG is benefiting from a substantial improvement in its booking trends. Solid growth in domestic bookings is contributing well. Further, BKNG is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental car, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.

Also, solid momentum across the agency, merchant, and advertising and other businesses is a tailwind for BKNG. Our estimates suggest that agency, merchant, and advertising and other revenues would see a year-over-year rise of 2.3%, 18.7% and 8.2%, respectively, in 2023. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. We expect 2023 total revenues to be up 9.5% from 2022.

Zacks Rank #1 Booking Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 36.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4% over the last seven days. Booking Holdings has a long-term earnings growth potential of 16.5%. The stock price of BKNG has surged 31.3% year to date.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG has been benefiting from its strong comparable restaurant sales growth, digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and menu innovation. Moreover, strength in digital sales, rise in menu prices, new restaurant openings and higher restaurant-level operating margin have been driving CMG‚Äôs performance.

CMG reported solid benefits from Project Square One with improvements, including throughput on the frontline, on-time and accuracy on the digital make line. CMG also emphasizes smarter pickup times to boost growth.

Zacks Rank #1 Chipotle Mexican Grill has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.3% and 32.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5% over the last 30 days. Chipotle Mexican Grill has a long-term earnings growth potential of 31.8%. The stock price of CMG has climbed 48.1% year to date.

Council chiefs are mulling printing customer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s car registration details on fast food packaging in a bid to tackle littering. 

Mr Howell, speaking at a climate change corporate delivery committee meeting, said: ""The Welsh Government has explored with McDonald‚Äö√Ñ√¥s, or their franchises, whether or not they could print number plates of cars collecting takeaways from their drive throughs with a view that that would discourage people from discarding their materials (litter).""

However, he admitted which fast-food companies would ""go first"" with such an initiative could cause issues. 

Two years ago, Plaid Cymru launched a petition calling on Welsh Government to make it compulsory for fast food outlets with drive-through facilities to print car number plates on all packaging so that litter can be traced.

This column a year ago was titled Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon: Which Stocks Should You Own? Those two were Alphabet and Apple.

The five stocks I suggested people avoid were down 46.8% from December 28, 2021 through December 23, 2022. To be sure, it was a down year, with the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Total Return Index dropping 18.4%. But the Sacred Seven did much worse.

The two I liked were down 33.1%, better than most of their brethren but considerably worse than the S&P.

Here‚Äôs what I think of the Sacred Seven now.

In the past decade, Alphabet shares have sold for an average of 27 times the company‚Äôs earnings per share. Currently that multiple is below 18. Not bad, I‚Äôd say, for a company that has grown its earnings by an average of 15% a year for the past decade).

The company‚Äôs subsidiaries include the Google search engine, You Tube video platform, Waymo self-driving cars, and Deep Mind artificial intelligence unit. (My daughter works for Deep Mind, which may prejudice me in Alphabet‚Äôs favor.)

I expect Amazon to be a business success, but a stock-market disappointment in 2023. The company lost momentum this year as people returned to brick-and-mortar stores. I expect that it will pick up market share in the next few years because people like the convenience of online shopping.

The stock, however, reminds me of IBM and McDonald‚Äôs in the Nifty Fifty Era around 1972. The companies did well but the stocks didn‚Äôt, because they were priced for perfection at about 60 times earnings. Amazon sells for 78 times earnings.

I still like Apple for the same reasons I did a year ago. Its iPhones and Mac computers have a loyal following. I like the company‚Äôs $48 billion in cash and marketable securities, and I love the 25% profit margin. At 22 times earnings, the stock is more expensive than I usually prefer, but not outlandish.

In addition to Facebook, Meta Platforms owns Instagram, Messenger and What‚Äôs App. That‚Äôs a worthy collection of assets, and the stock sells for only 11 times recent earnings. So I should like it, but I‚Äôm lukewarm.

What worries me is that I think Facebook‚Äôs past success stemmed in large part from sharing information about its customers with advertisers. I believe regulators will make it harder for Facebook and its brethren to do this. All in all, I think the stock will be a market performer or slightly better.

A powerhouse in both cloud computing and personal computing, Microsoft can boast a ten-year annual earnings-growth rate of nearly 17%. Last year, however, it was below 4%. I think future growth will be way above 4%, and I think profitability will be excellent.

Alas, the stock is pricey. It sells for nearly nine times the company‚Äôs revenue. To me, that‚Äôs a dangerously high multiple.

The days of rapid subscriber growth for streaming companies seem to be over, now that we‚Äôve already reached the point where more than half the programs Americans watch are streamed. To compete for market share, many streaming companies, including Netflix, are spending heavily on original content.

Netflix has had hits with many of its programs, such as The Queen‚Äôs Gambit, The Squid Game and Lupin. But such shows cost a lot of money. The earnings growth rate for Netflix in the past decade has been nearly 54%. Last year? Less than 1%.

The leading electric car maker is a cult stock. People adore it or hate it ‚Äì and the same goes for CEO Elon Musk. Of all the Sacred Seven, Tesla had the best return in 2017-2021, and the worst in the past year. With competition increasing in both China and the U.S., I think it‚Äôs in for another tough year.

Disclosure: I own Alphabet and Apple personally and for most of my clients.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Netflix, Inc. NFLX, American Express Co. AXP, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW and CSX Corp. CSX.

Here are highlights from Monday‚Äôs Analyst Blog:

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Netflix, Inc. and American Express Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date basis (+66.2% vs. +43.5%). Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive.



Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds. Amazon‚Äôs strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives.



However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are also concerns. Intensifying cloud competition poses a serious risk.

Netflix shares have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+84.8% vs. +28.9%). The company is benefiting from growing subscriber base thanks to a robust portfolio. Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix‚Äôs revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.



Netflix‚Äôs diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.



However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind. Netflix‚Äôs leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.

Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+6.7% vs. -3.6%). The company‚Äôs several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. The Zacks analyst expects the top line at around $60.8 billion in 2023.



Consumer spending on T&E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments. However, with higher utilization of the firm‚Äôs cards, expense in the form of card member services and card member rewards is likely to go up and strain the margins.



Marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise. A high debt burden induces a rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

The list ranks the largest and best-known carriers‚Äîas well as the safest low-cost airlines.

It‚Äôs been a rough few years for the airlines, from the massive slump in air travel caused by the pandemic to high-profile scenes like last week‚Äôs meltdown for Southwest Airlines, which canceled thousands of flights across the U.S. during the holiday period and has sparked an investigation by the Department of Transportation.

But if there can be any good news when it comes to air travel: ‚ÄúI would say the airline system is incredibly safe,‚Äù says Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, which monitors the safety and in-flight product for 385 airlines.

‚ÄúThe Covid pandemic has put enormous strain on airline across the globe with lengthy delays and flight cancellations testing even the most faithful and forgiving passengers,‚Äù says Thomas. ‚ÄúFrom a safety perspective, airlines have done a remarkable job in getting their pilots and cabin crew to operational flying, and their maintenance engineers are the unsung heroes who have looked after the aircraft. There have been no accidents over the pandemic period attributable to Covid.‚Äù

In coming up with its list, AirlineRatings.com considered a range of factors, including fleet age, serious incidents, fatalities, audits from aviation‚Äôs governing and industry bodies; government audits; industry-leading safety initiatives and more.

‚ÄúOur top twenty safest airlines are all standouts in the industry and are at the forefront of safety, innovation and launching of new aircraft,‚Äù says Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com. ‚ÄúIn fact, the safety margins between these top twenty airlines are very small, they are all outstanding airlines.‚Äù

Thomas says the site only looked at serious incidents in making its determinations. ‚ÄúAll airlines have incidents every day and many are aircraft manufacture issues, not airline operational problems,‚Äù says Thomas. ‚ÄúIt is the way the flight crew handles incidents that determines a good airline from an unsafe one. So just lumping all incidents together is very misleading.‚Äù

Coming out on top this year is Qantas, which has been named the safest airline for 2023. It replaces last year‚Äôs winner, Air New Zealand.

It‚Äôs not the first time that Qantas has come out on top: the 100-year-old Australian carrier was named the world‚Äôs safest airline from 2014 to 2017. In 2018, it was in the top 20 when AirlineRatings awarded 20 airlines jointly. Then it won again for three years in a row: 2019, 2020 and 2021.

A number of U.S. carriers made the top 20 list, with Alaska Airlines coming in first, followed by Hawaiian Airlines, United, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

‚ÄúNo big surprises this year with the major airlines continuing to pour resources into their pilot training and aircraft,‚Äù says Thomas. ‚ÄúThe burden has been far greater than normal bringing aircraft back from storage and additional training to get pilots back to work after Covid.‚Äù

AirlineRatings also ranked the safest low-cost airlines, with U.S. carriers Allegiant, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit and Westjet on the list.

Each time, Trump and his supporters, as well as detractors, have moved to gain from his time in court.

Trump pleaded not guilty on Thursday in a Washington federal court to three counts of conspiracy and one count of obstruction in a plot to subvert the results of the 2020 election. He similarly denied his guilt in March over hush money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, and then in June for illegally hoarding classified documents at his Florida resort.

A handful of Republicans, though competing with Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination, fired off statements as the ex-president left the courthouse and returned to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

The biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy posted a video message filmed outside the federal courthouse calling the January 6 indictment ‚Äúpoliticized persecution.‚Äù He earlier vowed to pardon Trump if elected.

After Trump was indicted on Tuesday, the former vice-president Mike Pence ‚Äì whom Trump allegedly called ‚Äútoo honest‚Äù after he refused to reject electoral votes according to the indictment ‚Äì used the arraignment as fodder for his own campaign, including to sell merch. ‚Äú[A]nyone who puts himself over the constitution should never be president of the United States,‚Äù Pence said in a statement.

Trump has also moved to profit from each of his own indictments, blasting supporters with a barrage of fundraising requests after his court appearances in Miami and New York.

Minutes after Trump left Washington, his son, Eric Trump, sent out a fundraising email with language calling the city ‚Äúthe belly of the beast‚Äù, according to NBC News. His campaign pulled in nearly $4m after his first arraignment in March and considerably less but still more than $1m after his arraignment in June, according to the New York Times.

Trump earlier said being arrested was ‚Äúa great honor‚Äù in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. He also posted Thursday ahead of his arraignment: ‚ÄúI NEED ONE MORE INDICTMENT TO ENSURE MY ELECTION!‚Äù

A district attorney, Fani Willis, is due to hand down a fourth indictment, related to election interference in Georgia, in the coming weeks.

Conservative media outlets largely heaped praise on Trump while blasting the current probes against President Joe Biden‚Äôs son, Hunter Biden. When asked by a CNN reporter if he would follow the indictment as he was cycling on vacation, the president said: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Fox News host Jesse Watters downplayed Trump‚Äôs January 6 charges on air while applauding Trump for his ‚Äúcalm demeanor‚Äù during the arraignment, according to Mediaite. ‚ÄúBy this January 6th indictment, we‚Äôre kind of tired of it,‚Äù Watters said on Thursday evening.

Trump has seemingly grown more comfortable with each indictment, according to NBC News‚Äô Garrett Haake, who has covered each indictment from the ground.

While Trump appeared ‚Äútight and tense‚Äù on his March court date in Manhattan, he was joking with his attorneys in Washington, Haake told MSNBC Thursday evening. ‚ÄúHe seemed so much more comfortable and practised at this.‚Äù

For many, the federal charges against Trump for his role in inciting the violence at the US Capitol were the first steps to finally holding the ex-president accountable for the deadly attack over which 1,000 individuals have been charged. A US Capitol police officer, Sgt Aquilino Gonell, was in the courtroom where Trump appeared for his arraignment, along with two other officers who were overwhelmed by rioters.

‚ÄúOn that day, I risked my life defending everyone regardless of their political affiliation,‚Äù wrote Gonell in a statement released after Trump left the courthouse. ‚ÄúOur democracy is worth fighting for. Not prosecuting is far riskier than having no consequences for the alleged power grab attempts. Justice and the rule of law must win for our democracy to survive.‚Äù

Adam Schiff of California, a member of the House January 6 select committee, signed a letter along with dozens of other Democratic lawmakers urging the district court to publicly broadcast the trial proceedings. ‚ÄúIt is imperative the conference ensures timely access to accurate and reliable information surrounding these cases and all of their proceedings, given the extraordinary national importance to our democratic institutions and the need for transparency,‚Äù the letter said.

After the Tuesday indictment, Schiff said in a statement posted online the law ‚Äúmust‚Äù be enforced against a former US president and candidate for ‚Äúthe sake of our democracy‚Äù.

Trump attorney John Lauro, who joined the legal team after special prosecutor Jack Smith informed the ex-president he was a target in the January 6 case, suggested moving the trial to West Virginia, which he called a more ‚Äúdiverse area‚Äù than DC in an interview with NPR ahead of the arraignment. Former federal prosecutors and legal experts said there was no basis for doing so.

The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who is the strongest contender for the Republican nomination after Trump, though trailing by a wide margin, said in a statement released after the Tuesday indictment that he would ‚Äúend the weaponization of government, replace the FBI director, and ensure a single standard of justice for all Americans‚Äù.

Alphabet (GOOGL) : Alphabet shares are slipping about 3% Monday afternoon after The New York Times reported Samsung is considering switching Google with Microsoft's Bing as the default search engine on its devices. Keep in mind that this could all be one big negotiation tactic on Samsung's end. According to the report, the deal between Samsung and Google is up for renewal soon and is estimated to be worth about $3 billion of revenue to Google. Why is Alphabet shedding about $50 billion of market cap today on a story about a revenue stream that brings in about $3 billion per year? It is confirmation that competition in the search industry is heating up, especially with more and more people interested in using AI chatbots. To be clear, we don't expect Alphabet's stronghold on the search industry ‚Äî and its more than 90% share of the industry, according to StatCounter ‚Äî to go away any time soon. Google search has become too ingrained in today's society. However, when you dominate such a large percentage of something, even a few-percentage-point loss can make a difference. That's what we are worried about. Further adding complexity to this story is Alphabet's current antitrust case with the Department of Justice . Given the mounting uncertainties facing the tech giant, it is only prudent to downgrade our rating to a 2 from a 1. This means we would rather be buyers on a pullback until we get more clarity into how the company will improve its AI positioning. And with GOOGL shares outperforming the broader market this year with its 19% gain, we would lighten up on our big position and sell some stock if we weren't restricted.

This not only confirmed that security is one of the most resilient corners of technology spending, but also that Palo Alto was winning business as the cloud security market consolidates around fewer platforms. Management's disciplined approach to profitability was also cheered by the market as the company delivered its third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability and achieved GAAP profitability on a cumulative basis for the last four quarters. That makes PANW eligible for inclusion into the S & P 500. We expect Palo Alto's stock to get a big pop if and when it gets added to the index. Even though the stock has made a nice run this year, up 43%, there is still room to run here. We are increasing our price target to $230 from $200.

‚Ä¢ None Piper Sandler upgraded Assurant (AIZ) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $144.

""I think we will see more layoffs,"" Independent Wealth Solutions Management portfolio manager Paul Meeks said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above), adding that ""these companies have probably gotten fat over the years, so I expect continued trimming.""

Salesforce said it would slash 10% of its workforce and execute select real estate exits and office space reductions. The company declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on what real estate it would be exiting or offices it would be reducing.

The company estimates it will incur $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion in charges related to the actions.

""I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment,"" Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees. ""As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we‚Äôre now facing, and I take responsibility for that.""

Benioff's tech peers have also found that come-to-Jesus moment on costs in recent months as investors press for better margins with sales growth cooling and stock prices languishing.

Snap canned 20% of its workforce in August, and Robinhood cut ties with 23% of its employee base the same month. In November, Meta and Amazon unveiled combined job cuts of 21,000 following soft third quarters. Twitter CEO Elon Musk moved swiftly to cut 3,700 Twitter employees in November upon the closure of his deal for the social media platform.

Meeks estimates the tech industry cut a jaw-dropping 300,000 jobs in 2022 alone.

The longtime tech analyst says the layoffs are setting the groundwork for improved profits for the industry coming out of the economic malaise.

""[The layoffs] are unfortunate for those employees but good for investors,"" Meeks added.

While many analysts have cautioned that the rally could be a narrow-based one, with gains driven by just a few major tech stocks, some Wall Street pros are expecting the S & P 500 to rally further. Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday that he has raised his S & P 500 price target from 4,150 to 4,450 . That represents a 4% increase from Monday's close of 4,273.79. He said the index could reach that target by July 4. The senior managing director for equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy listed three factors he says are ""favorable for further rally."" These are: the pandemic stimulus ""stock of money"" which continues to be supportive; better-than-expected earnings and margins with tailwinds that include cost-cutting; and the artificial intelligence trend. Emanuel said that the AI buzz driving stocks has turned into a so-called ""momentum market"" like the Internet-related rally of the late 1990s to 2000. ""The Momentum broadened last week into the larger S & P 500 and importantly the Small Cap Russell 2000; this broadening is very positive and looks set to continue,"" he wrote in notes sent to CNBC. Brian Stutland, portfolio manager at Equity Armor Investments, said he would normally be concerned about a narrow rally being driven by only a handful of names. However, he's taking some reassurance from volatility indexes, with the VIX declining. ""If there's going to be a bear market, if there's going to be some sort of recession and disconnect in the marketplace, we would see the markets rise and volatility starts to rise,"" Stutland told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia."" ""I don't think we're at the point where we've seen hedgers come into market, institutional order flow that would indicate 'hey, it's time to panic because we're gonna get a correction,'"" he added. ""It kind of feels like this market can continue to go and in fact, we're nearing basically a 20% level from lows of the markets last year that would indicate a bull market that we're entering. We're very close there."" Paul Meeks, portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management, has a differing view, however. He believes markets are set for at least a ""modest correction."" ""Some investors have driven stocks up based on the false premise that rates will fall but I think that they'll either keep rising or they'll plateau here well into 2024. If I'm right, we'll probably have a correction. Stock prices are just too steep based on that misunderstanding,"" he told CNBC. He said the ""biggest unsolved problem"" is inflation, which must fall ‚Äî and the tight jobs market is making that ""almost impossible."" How to trade right now Emanuel of Evercore said investors should buy stocks that he termed ""momentum masters,"" or stocks with price and earnings momentum which are defensive. Some examples he listed are Google , cloud security firm Zscaler and airline service provider Copa Holdings . Emanuel also said that small-cap stocks should ""should be in a position to participate in the rally."" ""They have been laggards again, essentially going back to the bank stress and have less exposure as an index to technology. But for us part of the narrative around the Fed, likely pausing here ‚Ä¶ says that this is a good time to start dipping one one's toes into small caps,"" he said. Small-cap stocks can be closely tied to the performance of regional banks. Meeks added that U.S. stocks, in particular tech and other growth names, are too expensive. ""Of course, I believe AI stocks are dangerously expensive given all the hype around them,"" he said. However, if he were to ""try to find the next [Nvidia] he would recommend Advanced Micro Devices , Google, Meta or Marvell Technology .""

The S&P 500 was 0.3% lower in early trading, giving back some of its gains from last week when it reached its highest level since early December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18 points, or 0.1%, at 33,996, as of 10 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% lower.

Markets have been veering recently on worries that the economy and corporate profits may be set for a steep drop-off, along with competing hopes that cooling inflation will get the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates.

The central bank‚Äôs next decision on rates is coming Wednesday, and most investors expect it to announce an increase of just 0.25 percentage points. That would be the smallest increase in nearly a year, following a spate of hikes of 0.75 points and then a 0.50-point increase, and it would mean less added pressure on the economy.

Higher rates intentionally slow the economy by making it more expensive to buy a house or anything else on credit, while also dragging down on prices for investments.

The big question is whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell afterward will give markets what they want to hear ‚Äî hints that rate hikes will end soon and rate cuts may even be possible late this year ‚Äî or stick to the Fed‚Äôs mantra that it plans to keep rates higher for longer, even if a modest recession hits.

Central banks for Europe and for the United Kingdom are also set to announce their latest increases for rates this week.

Beyond interest rates, more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled this week to report how much profit they made in the last three months of 2022. Among them are tech heavyweights Apple, Amazon, and Google‚Äôs parent company. Because these companies are three of the four biggest on Wall Street by market value, their stock movements carry much more sway on the S&P 500 than others.

The only other stock that rivals them in size, Microsoft, shook Wall Street last week when it gave forecasts for upcoming results that raised worries about a slowdown in corporate spending on tech.

Companies generally look to be on track to report slightly weaker profit for the end of 2022 than expected, according to a BofA Global Research report. That‚Äôs an indication that the strong January enjoyed by the S&P 500 so far is more about improving sentiment on Wall Street than about better fundamentals, strategist Savita Subramanian wrote.

Strategists at Morgan Stanley led by Michael Wilson warn tougher times may be ahead.

‚ÄúThe reality is that earnings are proving to be even worse than feared based on the data, especially as it relates to margins,‚Äù they wrote in a report. ‚ÄúSecondly, investors seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Fight the Fed‚Äô. Perhaps this week will serve as a reminder.‚Äù

Later this week, the U.S. government will also give its latest monthly update on the job market. Hiring has remained remarkably resilient across the broad economy, even as housing and other corners weaken sharply under the weight of all the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes from last year.

Some big tech companies have announced high-profile layoffs after acknowledging they misread their boom coming out of the pandemic. But job cuts may be starting to spread to other areas of the economy. Hasbro and 3M last week announced layoffs.

All told, economists expect Friday‚Äôs report to show that U.S. employers added 187,500 more jobs than they cut during January. That would be a slowdown from December‚Äôs hiring of 223,000.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.54% from 3.51% late Friday. The two-year yield, which tends to move more on expectations of Fed actions, rose to 4.24% from 4.20%.

In stock markets overseas, reports that holiday travel during last week‚Äôs Lunar New Year festivities was nearly back to normal raised expectations that China‚Äôs economy may regain momentum faster than anticipated after it relaxed pandemic restrictions late last year.

The US government continues to seek information on confidential agreements that Musk made with foreign investors that hold stakes in Twitter after he bought it, and whether those deals allow them to access users‚Äô personal data, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive deliberations.

Musk‚Äôs successful takeover and de-listing of Twitter has been in the spotlight as criticism mounts from US lawmakers over the participation of investors from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

The Twitter deal appeared in the clear earlier this week when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she saw no need for an investigation. Yellen‚Äôs Treasury Department leads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, which probes such deals for potential national-security risks.

Her comments came only days after President Joe Biden had said Musk‚Äôs business interests and links to foreign governments warranted review.

Musk and Twitter didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment. Treasury Department spokesman Michael Gwin said Cfius doesn‚Äôt comment on transactions it may or may not be reviewing, adding that the panel is committed to safeguarding national security.

The potential for action by Cfius emerged amid rising concerns over how Musk‚Äôs various business interests overlap with top US national security priorities. Musk‚Äôs Starlink satellite internet network, for instance, has been used in Ukraine to maintain communications during its fight to repel Russia‚Äôs invasion, a service he briefly threatened to cut off in October.

Democratic Senators Mark Warner, who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Chris Murphy have called for greater scrutiny of the Twitter deal given the ownership stakes held by some foreigners, including Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, who rolled over his existing stake in Twitter into Musk‚Äôs deal, and Qatar‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund. Tesla Inc.‚Äôs manufacturing site near Shanghai has also been raised as a potential leverage point by Beijing.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand this decision,‚Äù Murphy tweeted Tuesday after Yellen‚Äôs comments, which were reported by CBS News. ‚ÄúCfius is designed to review transactions like this.‚Äù

Trading was intermittently halted on at least 20 regional banks as the velocity of money forced regulators to intervene. The Big Four were also drawn into the bloodletting. Citigroup's share price dived 7.45 percent, Wells Fargo sank 7.1 percent, Bank of America plunged 5.8 percent and JP Morgan fell 1.8 percent.

Among the worst affected regional banks were First Republic Bank which fell by 62 percent, Western Alliance which closed with a loss of 47 percent and KeyCorp which dropped by 21 percent.

The declines struck the Street despite Joe Biden making an intervention minutes before the market opened to claim that 'Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe'.

Former Trump White House adviser Steve Moore warned that SVB 'may just be the tip of the iceberg', exposing a broader weakness brought about by Biden's $4trillion COVID stimulus package.

SVB's sudden collapse Friday - the second-largest ever by a US bank - struck when investors frantically started withdrawing funds amid fears it could no longer keep pace with the Fed's rate hikes.

Moore told Fox News: 'I think it's important for people to understand how this potential banking crisis happened. It's not because there aren't enough bank regulators, as Biden is trying to say.

'It's because of the massive inflation and the trillions and trillions of dollars of borrowing that the federal government has done that has put our financial system in great jeopardy and great peril.

'You can't just keep doing this month after month, year after year, borrowing trillions and trillions of dollars. And so what happened, because of the Biden spending and debt policies, is that not only did inflation go up, but interest rates have gone up.'

He said the Fed had already raised interest rates multiple times throughout 2022 and has signalled that intends to continue doing so to cool the overheated economy.

'That's caused a lot of financial problems for these big banks is the interest rates go up,' Harris added.

But many speculated the central bank could now become less hawkish, and the yield on the 2-year Treasury tumbled.

Regulators over the weekend stepped in to restore investor confidence in the banking system, saying SVB's depositors will have access to their funds on Monday.

To some investors, the Fed's decision next week will also hinge on inflation data due this week.

'If we get shockingly bad Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index, the Fed is going to find itself in a tough spot or a much tougher spot that it even finds itself in ahead of those prints,' said Orion Advisor Solutions CIO Timothy Holland.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 5.82 points, or 0.16%, to end at 3,855.54 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 49.74 points, or 0.45%, to 11,188.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 86.66 points, or 0.27%, to 31,822.08.

The benchmark S&P 500 is now up about 1% for the year so far. Earlier in the session it fell, briefly erasing all the year-to-date gains.

The CPI data is due on Tuesday and PPI on Wednesday.

The defensive utilities sector was among the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors while interest rate sensitive groups such as real estate and technology also climbed.

'The market is now expecting that the Fed is likely to not raise rates this month and so they may enter a pause period,' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.

Shares of SVB's peer Signature Bank, which was also shut down by regulators, were halted. Nasdaq said they would remain so until the exchange's request for additional information was 'fully satisfied.'

Meanwhile, it also cut its US Bancorp stake by 90% to $291 million by the end of 2022. The duo each sold off more than 20% last year, slightly underperforming the S & P 500.

Here at Underscored, we‚Äôve tested seven of its most recent devices, and named the Kindle Oasis the best e-reader overall and the Paperwhite the best budget e-reader. Now the company has released its first e-reader with note-taking capabilities, the Kindle Scribe, and we‚Äôve found that despite its limited software and supersized screen, it‚Äôs a great new installment in Amazon‚Äôs robust e-reader lineup.

What we liked about it

Before we talk about the Scribe‚Äôs note-taking capabilities, let‚Äôs discuss how it functions as an e-reader. It boasts a gorgeous 10.2-inch, 300 ppi glare-free screen that utilizes Amazon‚Äôs flagship Paperwhite display technology found on most of its modern e-readers. This makes text pop and a joy to read. It‚Äôs only .22 inches thin and approximately 15 ounces, so holding it in one hand is possible but not always comfortable. It also features an adjustable warm light and auto-adjusting front light so you can read and write in the sun outside or in bed with no other lights on.

There are a number of customizable theme, font and layout choices you can adjust to tailor your reading experience to your own needs. You can choose between custom, standard, compact and large themes; nine different fonts, 14 font sizes and five levels of boldness; two orientations, three margins, two alignments and three spacing options. Additional options include reading progress percentage, page numbers and the ability to display a clock while reading.

While I‚Äôm a fan of physical page-turn buttons as on the Kindle Oasis, I didn‚Äôt mind the lack of them on the Scribe. There‚Äôs a large bezel for your thumb to rest on while holding the device in either hand, then you can either swipe the screen or tap either side of the screen to move from page to page. Page-turning is fast and responsive, and I had no latency issues.

With more than 13 million books in the Kindle Store (9 million more e-books than you‚Äôll find in Kobo‚Äôs store, one of Kindle‚Äôs biggest competitors), it‚Äôs arguably the best e-book store out there, so you‚Äôll likely be able to find whatever you want to read on there.

More than an e-reader, the Kindle Scribe allows you to store notebooks of digital writing or doodles. There are currently 18 notebook layouts to choose from, ranging from the simple (blank, lined or dotted pages) to the more complex (calendars and storyboard pages). Whether you‚Äôre bullet journaling, jotting down your grocery list or sketching, there‚Äôs sure to be a layout that suits your needs. I had a really fun time adapting my physical bullet journal into a digital format on the Scribe using the gridded layout option, and it‚Äôs worth experimenting with all the layouts to see what you like best. As of now, you‚Äôre able to view all your notebooks in the Kindle app, but you cannot edit them there. We‚Äôd love to see more export options available in the future.

The Scribe comes bundled with a stylus (either the Basic Pen for $340 or the Premium Pen for $370). We tried the Premium Pen, which offers a shortcut button and built-in eraser. You can adjust the shortcut button on the Premium Pen to do a number of tasks; I‚Äôve kept mine on highlighter so when I press and hold the shortcut button it will highlight whatever text is underneath. The built-in eraser is also a nice benefit and works well, making the stylus feel more like a traditional pencil, but I‚Äôm not sure the Premium Pen is worth the additional $30. That said, using the stylus is a joy. It feels like writing on paper, and I didn‚Äôt experience any latency when putting the tip to screen. It‚Äôs also worth noting that both pens never need to be charged and magnetically attach to the side of the Scribe, two benefits that some other paper tablets lack.

Aside from writing or sketching in notebooks, you can also handwrite sticky notes in your Kindle e-books. To write a sticky note, all you have to do is click the sticky note icon in the sidebar that appears on every e-book on the Scribe, then jot away. There‚Äôs also the option to write a text note using a keyboard if you don‚Äôt want to handwrite your note.

Marking up PDFs is relatively straightforward

On the Scribe, you also have the ability to upload PDFs and write directly on them. The easiest way I found to do this is by downloading the Kindle app. Once the Kindle app is on your phone, you can go to your documents, choose your desired file, then share to the Kindle app. A screen will then open that will allow you to send the document to your Kindle device(s). Within a minute or so, you should see the file appear on your Scribe.

As a former proofreader of graphic novels, I love this ability to mark up PDFs directly on the Scribe. I could also see this feature being super helpful for students and businesspeople who work with lots of documents daily.

What we didn‚Äôt like about it

While the Scribe‚Äôs hardware is top-notch, its software could use some zhuzhing up. As of this writing, there‚Äôs only one pen option with five thicknesses and one highlighter option with five thicknesses, aside from the eraser. I‚Äôd love to see a wider variety of pen and marker options for writing and abilities like copying and pasting or moving text around by circling it, options that are available on other paper tablets like the fantastic ReMarkable 2.

On Amazon‚Äôs Help & Customer Service page for the Scribe, the company does promise that ‚Äúin the coming months‚Äù it will provide free software updates, including more writing tools, new brush types and copy/paste tools; additional notebook organization options; and the ability to send documents directly from Microsoft Word. While that‚Äôs a lot to look forward to, it‚Äôs a shame that the company released the Scribe without these options in the first place.

While the ability to write little Post-its on e-books is great and fun, I‚Äôd love to be able to mark up the books themselves. It‚Äôs a little wild to me that this isn‚Äôt an option. This means you‚Äôre unable to write in the margins of books, circle words, underline sentences, etc. I‚Äôd never write in a physical book in this way, but because it‚Äôs digital, I‚Äôd love the option to dirty up the pages with scribbles and notations rather than rely only on the sticky notes.

The Kindle Scribe is the biggest and priciest Kindle e-reader to date, but its ability to let you take handwritten notes sets it apart from the pack. As just an e-reader, we prefer the less bulky Kindle Oasis with page-turn buttons, but for students, artists and writers, the note-taking capabilities of the Scribe are a game changer. Unfortunately, the software in its current state is lacking, and you can find more robust tools and a wider variety of brush types on other, more affordable paper tablets like the ReMarkable 2. But if you prefer an e-reader and paper tablet in one, the Scribe is well worth the price.",Amazon‚Äôs Kindle Scribe makes reading and writing a joy ‚Äî for a high price,non-causal,,[],[],[],['PM'],-0.99634355

Disney stock was down more than 13 percent on Wednesday following the company‚Äôs disappointing fourth quarter results that contained a slew of bad news, including the revelation that Disney lost a staggering $1.5 billion on streaming services such as Disney+ and Hulu for the period.

At just below $87, Disney shares are at their lowest level since 2014. For the calendar year, the stock is down close to 70 percent.

Disney‚Äôs earnings and revenue for the quarter failed to meet Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, causing some analysts to cut their valuations. The company‚Äôs streaming losses have steadily mounted this year as it aims to challenge Netflix for market dominance.

Disney said its three main streaming services ‚Äî Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu ‚Äî have increased their subscriber numbers to more than 235 million as of October 1 ‚Äî exceeding Netflix‚Äôs 223 million subscribers. Both Disney+ and Netflix are in the midst of rolling out ad-supported options for consumers in the hopes that commercials will not only provide another source of revenue but also lure more customers at a time when many are looking to save money.

Like other legacy studios, Disney is betting the farm on streaming entertainment. While they have the advantage over Netflix in terms of their vast libraries of movies and TV shows, Netflix has had a head-start in terms of building a subscriber base.

Disney recently announced steep price hikes on Disney+ and Hulu, with the price of a Disney+ subscription jumping nearly 40 percent.

Disney shares have been a mostly downward trajectory this year, alarming longtime investors who once regarded Disney as a sure thing. As Breitbart News reported, the stock closed below $100 in June, the first that had happened in more than two years. Since then the stock had recovered some of its losses, only to decline once again starting in the fall.

On Monday, the agency announced that attorneys general for Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Washington and West Virginia, had joined the litigation. Virginia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee joined the DOJ in the original filing.

‚ÄúWe look forward to litigating this important case alongside our state law enforcement partners to end Google‚Äôs long-running monopoly in digital advertising technology markets,‚Äù Doha Mekki, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department‚Äôs antitrust division, said in a statement.

The Justice Department and attorneys general allege that Google's suite of online ad tech tools ‚Äî technology to buy, sell and serve ads online ‚Äî prevents competitors from entering the market and blocks publishers from monetizing their own content. The department further claims that Google should be required to divest a host of entities that allow it to carry out the allegedly offending behavior.

The DOJ wants Google to divest, at the least, its Google Ad Manager suite, including both Google‚Äôs publisher ad server, DFP, and Google's ad exchange, AdX.

""Google‚Äôs anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google‚Äôs few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,"" the complaint states.

The suit goes on to allege that Google is using its outsized market share to take supra-competitive profits for itself.

Yahoo Finance reached out to Alphabet's Google for the company's response to the additional state plaintiffs and will update this story if it receives a reply.

The lawsuit came more than two years after the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general joined in a separate antitrust suit alleging that Google's search and search advertising businesses violate U.S. antitrust laws.

Google‚Äôs digital advertising business has become an antitrust target due to its unrivaled size and volume. The company holds a commanding lead in the $278.6 billion space, of which Google's revenues in 2022 totaled approximately $224.5 billion. The company controls some of the most important links in the online advertising chain ‚Äî specifically its DoubleClick platform, a premier tool for online publishers, helping them create, manage, and track online marketing campaigns.

Google has for years also faced scrutiny from domestic and overseas lawmakers and regulators concerning its dominance across online and mobile markets.

In the U.S, the firm has faced investigations by the DOJ, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general over suspicions that the company‚Äôs search and digital advertising businesses operate as illegal monopolies.

In 2021, dozens of attorneys general sued the company, alleging that it was operating illegal monopolies in the market for Android app distribution by imposing technical barriers that prevent third parties from distributing apps outside the Play Store.

Over a decade ago, the company was fined roughly $10 billion (8.6 billion euros) by the European Commission, the European Union‚Äôs antitrust watchdog. Those fines resulted from three separate antitrust violations alleged by the Commission.

In 2017, the company was hit by the Commission for allegedly abusing its market dominance in search, and again in 2018 for allegedly abusing its market power in the mobile space by preloading its own apps on new Android phones. And in 2019, the company was again fined for limiting its rivals from working with companies that already had deals with Google‚Äôs AdSense platform.

Prior to the lawsuit filed in January, Alphabet reportedly sought to quell the DOJ's antitrust concerns by offering to split up its ad auction and ad placement businesses. That offer, according to The Wall Street Journal, was to maintain the would-be separate entities under the company's larger, parent company, Alphabet.

With world markets preparing for first-quarter updates from U.S. Big Tech firms this week, the heat under simmering geopolitical tensions went up a notch as a Chinese diplomat to France questioned the independence of all former Soviet states.

Ahead of an event-packed week, Chinese and global emerging market stocks fell to their lowest in almost a month and the yuan fell to its lowest in almost six weeks as the controversial statement met with fierce backlash in European capitals- especially those of Baltic states now European Union members.

Although China's foreign ministry attempted to row back by saying Beijing respects the sovereignty and integrity of all countries - despite its refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine - the row will unnerve many investors wary of Beijing's support for Moscow and position on its right to Taiwan.

And with China's economy accelerating again after it ended its extended COVID-related lockdowns, spurring world growth again in the process, the political tension risks cutting across many investors' attempts to re-invest in the country.

Otherwise, a packed earnings season dominates this week's investment radar as more than a third of S&P500 companies report.

Three of the four biggest U.S. companies by market value -- Microsoft (MSFT.O), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) -- are scheduled to post updates, with Microsoft and Alphabet due on Tuesday and Amazon on Thursday. Facebook parent Meta Platforms is sandwiched in between on Wednesday.

Including Intel (INTC.O), those five tech stocks have accounted for two-thirds of the S&P500's gains this year - with the Artificial Intelligence craze sparked by the emergence of ChatGPT adding a new non-cyclical attraction to the sector.

And that cycle, for all the recession fears that abound, got another fillip from Friday's news of a marked acceleration of U.S. and global service sector firms in April.

But before markets get a taste of Q1 tech profits, the reverberations from last month's banking blow-up are still being absorbed.

First Republic, one of the U.S. regional banks caught in the storm, reports later on Monday as Wall Street tots up the level of deposit flight from these banks and ponders plans for new regulation of mid-sized operations.

With European earnings kicking into high gear this week too, collapsed Credit Suisse(CSGN.S) said on Monday that 61 billion Swiss francs ($68 billion) in assets left the bank in the first quarter and that outflows were continuing, underscoring the challenge faced by UBS (UBSG.S) in rescuing its rival.

U.S. and euro zone first quarter gross domestic product numbers are due out later in the week too, with eyes also on new Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda as he chairs his first monetary policy meeting at the end of the week.

Although confidence is high that the BOJ's ultra-dovish policy will remain unchanged next Friday, economists flag the non-negligible risk of another surprise tweak to the explicit bond yield cap.

Japan's stocks closed in positive territory on Monday, bucking the trend in the rest of Asia.

European stocks were slightly negative and U.S. stock futures also marginally in the red ahead of Wall Street's open. Crude oil prices were lower.

With another Federal Reserve quarter-point interest rate rise next month now baked into pricing, Treasury yields were mostly flat. Focus is on the tense debt ceiling standoff - with the House of Representatives due to vote on Republicans' spending and debt bill this week.

The dollar was mixed - up against Asian currencies but off against European currencies amid hawkish European Central Bank soundings on interest rates.

Events to watch out for on Monday:

The S&P 500 fell 0.25%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.23%, or 9 points, and the Nasdaq was down 0.5%.

Big tech remained under pressure as economic data including Wednesday‚Äôs hot wholesale inflation report stoked fears that the Fed‚Äôs rate-hike path rate has widened.

""In light of the stronger growth and firmer inflation news, we are adding another 25-basis point rate hike to our Fed forecast,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 1%.

Energy also brought the pain to the broader market, falling more than 3%, paced by falling oil prices amid worries that further Fed hikes will blunt demand.

EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Hess (NYSE:HES), and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) were among the biggest decliners falling more than 5% on the day.

But the earnings front offered some reprieve as Deere&Company (NYSE:DE) rallied 7% after the farming equipment maker upgraded its annual profit guidance and reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that markedly beat Wall Street estimates.

In the company's annual shareholder letter published over the weekend, Buffett explained that the ""secret sauce"" of their investing success is to make ""investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers."" This approach is known as value investing, where the goal is to hang on to a top-performing stock rather than trade stocks based on short-term price fluctuations, otherwise known as active investing. Of course, picking winners isn't easy. But Munger has previously outlined four rules that the two Berkshire Hathaway executives follow when choosing whether to invest in a business. Aside from Buffett's No. 1 rule, ""don't lose money,"" here are four questions that Munger and Buffett ask when deciding whether or not to invest in a business.

1. Do you understand the business?

Aside from knowing how a business operates and what it offers to consumers, you also want an idea of where a company is going to be in 10 years, if not for decades, says Buffett. ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes,"" he wrote in his 1996 letter to shareholders. Berkshire Hathaway famously missed out on tech companies Google and Amazon in the early 2000s, because Buffett wasn't sure he understood the businesses in terms of their long-term profitability. This made it harder to determine the value of their stocks. While Berkshire may have passed on Google and Amazon, other investments in blue-chip companies like American Express and Coca-Cola have paid off over time. This cautious approach might mean missing out on more speculative opportunities, but Buffett has said that he and Munger ""miss a lot of things, and we'll keep doing it.""

2. Does the business have a durable competitive advantage?

Buffett has said that the ""most important"" factor in picking a successful business investment is the company's competitive advantage, which he likens to a ""moat"" surrounding an ""economic castle."" The more secure the competitive advantage, the more likely the company will prosper over decades. A competitive advantage could be a powerful brand that people are always willing to pay for, like Coca-Cola, or it could be a unique business model, like selling insurance directly to the consumer rather than through insurance brokerages, as is the case with Geico.

3. Does the business' management have integrity and talent?

Buffett has said that he looks for three things in a manager or leader: intelligence, initiative and integrity. But integrity matters most of all, ""because if you're going to get someone without integrity, you want them lazy and dumb,"" he said in a 1998 speech. ""We do not wish to join with managers who lack admirable qualities, no matter how attractive the prospects of their business,"" Buffett wrote in a 1989 shareholder letter. ""We've never succeeded in making a good deal with a bad person."" With integrity comes trust. That means Buffett and Munger don't have to spend much time micromanaging every decision a leader makes. ""The important thing we do with managers, generally, is to find the .400 hitters and then not tell them how to swing,"" said Buffett at the 1994 Berkshire annual meeting.",Warren Buffett's 'secret sauce' for investing success: Be 'business pickers' not 'stock pickers',non-causal,,['CEO'],[],[],"['JNJ', 'CEO']",-0.02741399

Let me explain.

Executives at Alphabet on May 10 will host the annual Google I/O developers conference. This is an important opportunity to reset the narrative about artificial intelligence projects at Google.

Contrary to popular belief, Google has not fallen behind Microsoft (MSFT) in the race for artificial intelligence supremacy. While Microsoft has made some impressive AI strides thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, Google still has a formidable edge in several key areas of AI research and development.

One of these areas is natural language processing, the ability of machines to understand and generate human language. Google has been a pioneer in NLP since its inception, with products like Google Search, Google Translate, and Google Assistant. These cutting-edge applications rely on sophisticated NLP algorithms. And Google‚Äôs state-of-the-art NLP models BERT, T5, and Meena have set new benchmarks for question answering, text summarization, and conversational agents.

Google also excels in computer vision, an AI field devoted to teaching machines to recognize and analyze images. The development of CV at Google began in 2006 with the acquisition of YouTube. The video sharing service gave Google engineers access to a massive amount of image data. Engineers soon leveraged CV expertise to create innovative products such as Google Photos, Google Lens, and Waymo, a subsidiary that uses advanced object detection for self-driving cars.

Artificial neural networks may not be a phrase that rolls easily off the tongue like ChatGPT, yet this technology is foundational to most AI applications. Google has been a leader in ANNs since its launch of Google Brain in 2011, one of the first large-scale projects to use deep learning.

The AI problem at Google is not about engineering. It‚Äôs about marketing.

ChatGPT seems so important because a human-like chatbot seems impossible given the perceived state of technology. Computers are not supposed to be ‚Äúthink‚Äù, let alone carry on reasoned conversation.

At Google I/O executives must reset the conversation about AI and Google.

Admittedly, this is not where top brass at Google shine brightest. Sundar Pichai, chief executive is an engineer‚Äôs engineer. He quietly gets the work done. Pichai came to Google in 2004 after working as a materials engineer at Applied Materials (AMAT), and a stint as a management consultant at McKinsey and Company. He later oversaw the development of Google Chrome, Chrome OS, Gmail and Google Maps. Pichai is affable yet staid, and his management style reflects this temperament. The current conversation about AI demands more. Investors believe Google is facing an existential threat from ChatGPT. Pichai must change that narrative. He needs to turn up the AI wow factor.

Google Assistant is a personalized, AI virtual assistant launched in 2016 at Google I/O. Assistant lives in every Google smart home product, Android-based mobile device, Android Automotive-equipped car and truck, and even on iPhones via popular Google applications like Chrome, Search and Maps. This is billions of devices. Assistant is the perfect vehicle for Pichai to show off what Google AI engineers can do.

At Google I/O on May 10 Pichai is expected to reveal the latest incarnation of Bard, Google‚Äôs answer to ChatGPT. Bard is the natural evolution of Assistant because the AI software is ubiquitous, and already capable of fully duplexed conversation.

More importantly, expectations for Bard are low. Pichai rushed a Bard demo in February to get ahead of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing/ChatGTP reveal. It did not go well. The presentation was riddled with errors and glitchy playback. Shares plunged and the narrative about Microsoft‚Äôs AI lead was born.

At a share price of $107.34, Alphabet trades at 17.3x forward earnings and 4.8x sales. The company has gross profit margins of 55.5% and profit margins of 20.6%. Shares could rally to $122.40 heading into May 10, a gain of 14% from current levels.

The agency accuses the company of abusing ‚Äúmonopoly power‚Äù at the disadvantage of websites and advertisers who use other advertising tools, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday (PDF). A press conference is scheduled for 2PM ET to announce the lawsuit.

‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google‚Äôs few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,‚Äù the lawsuit reads.

It goes on to allege that Google‚Äôs various acquisitions allowed it to ‚Äúneutralize or eliminate‚Äù competitors. According to the government‚Äôs lawyers, when you add up the alleged anti-competitive moves, ‚Äúthese interrelated and interdependent actions have had a cumulative and synergistic effect that has harmed competition and the competitive process.‚Äù

Google knew this was coming. Last year, the company attempted to avoid a potential lawsuit from the DOJ by offering to separate its ad auctions business, which sells and puts ads on customers‚Äô websites, from Google‚Äôs digital advertising arm. But instead of making it a separate company altogether, the move would‚Äôve put the division under the umbrella of Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet.

That and the other concessions Google reportedly offered obviously weren‚Äôt enough to convince the DOJ that it‚Äôs not engaging in anti-competitive practices. The DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit asks the court to force Google to divest its advertising businesses. Eight states, including New York, California, Connecticut, and Virginia, also signed on to the suit. Google didn‚Äôt immediately respond to The Verge‚Äôs request for comment.

The DOJ sued Google for similar reasons in 2020, accusing it of illegal monopolization of the search and ad markets. At the time, the agency asked the court to ‚Äúbreak Google‚Äôs grip on search distribution so that competition and innovation can take hold.‚Äù Earlier this month, Google filed a motion to dismiss a complaint from the agency that alleges Google leverages its Android operating system and general grasp on the search market to further limit competition in the industry.

The DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit comes as part of a wider governmental crackdown on the grasp of Big Tech. In May of last year, a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats introduced the Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act. The bill could force companies and Google and Meta to divest their advertising businesses, as it would bar companies processing over $20 billion per year in digital ad transactions from partaking in multiple parts of the digital ad industry.",Google is being sued by the US government and eight states over online advertising,non-causal,"ET, PDF, US, DOJ",['COVID'],[],"['DOJ', 'ET', 'PDF', 'US']","['PDF', 'DOJ', 'ET', 'COVID', 'HUM', 'US']",0.95202965

The top and bottom lines advanced year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results have been bolstered by robust global demand, continued strength in the Nutrition unit and a solid product portfolio.



Shares of ADM have lost 8.8% in the past three months compared with the industry‚Äôs 9.4% decline.

Archer Daniels‚Äô adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share in the fourth quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64. The figure also jumped 28.7% from $1.50 in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels‚Äô earnings were $1.84 per share, up 33.3% from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs $1.26.

Revenues advanced 13.6% year over year to $26,231 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,224 million. Solid sales across all segments contributed to the top line.



Segment-wise, revenues for Ag Services & Oilseeds grew 16.3% year over year, whereas Carbohydrate Solutions‚Äô revenues rose 1.9% year over year. Nutrition witnessed year-over-year revenue growth of 7.3%.



The gross profit increased 6.8% year over year to $1,762 million, while the gross margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 6.7% in the quarter under review. SG&A expenses rose 14.1% to $897 million.



Archer Daniels has reported an adjusted segmental operating profit of $1,665 million in fourth-quarter 2022, up 17.8% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, ADM‚Äôs segmental operating profits grew 16.1% year over year to $1,611 million.

Adjusted operating profit for Ag Services & Oilseeds rose 46.2% year over year to $1,184 million. This can be attributable to strength across the South American region, driven by higher margins and volumes, while low water conditions reduced North America export volumes. The Global Trade performance was drab due to lower ocean freight, partly offset by robust results in EMEA origination and destination marketing.



Crushing results have been sharply higher year over year. Strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins in North America. Solid oil demand in EMEA led to strong rapeseed margins, which more than offset higher energy costs.



Refined Products and Other results have been strong year over year, benefiting from healthy demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the United States and biodiesel globally. Also, equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher than that in the year-earlier quarter.



The Carbohydrate Solutions segment‚Äôs adjusted operating profit declined 39% to $261 million. The Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, has recorded improved year-over-year results. This was mainly owing to solid volumes and strong margins in the North America region, which partly offset lower ethanol margins. Meanwhile, robust margins aided the EMEA region. The global wheat milling business witnessed higher margins, driven by solid demand.



Vantage Corn Processors‚Äô results have been soft due to higher ethanol inventory levels, which, in turn, dented the margins.



In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $131 million fell 18.1% from $160 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit remained dismal year over year. The Flavors unit remained flat, while the continued momentum aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health & Wellness business witnessed year-over-year growth, driven by the bioactives portfolio, including the results of the Deerland acquisition.



The Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids due to a recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results have acted as an upside, driven by APAC and Latin America, partly offset by the impacts of sluggish demand in EMEA.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,037 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,677 million; and shareholders‚Äô equity of $24,317 million. In the nine months ending Dec 31, 2022, ADM used $3,478 million in cash for operating activities.



The board raised its quarterly dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents, payable on Mar 2, 2023, to shareholders as of record as of Feb 9. This marks the 365th consecutive quarterly payment and 50th dividend hike.

According to a new report from Bloomberg, the tech behemoth plans to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies that will be released in theaters, and has already approached movie studios about partnering on certain titles for releases this year and in the future.

Although plans are still being finalized, the company wants to air movies in thousands of theaters for at least one month ‚Äî bucking its previous strategy of streaming exclusives and limited box office releases.

Potential films includes Martin Scorsese‚Äôs ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" Matthew Vaughn's ""Argylle,"" and Ridley Scott‚Äôs ""Napoleon,"" the report noted.

The report sent shares of theatrical giants like AMC (AMC), IMAX (IMAX) and Cinemark (CNK) higher in early trading on Thursday, gaining as much as 5%, 5%, and 8.5%, respectively.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

'The pendulum is certainly swinging back'

This report comes after Apple rival Amazon (AMZN) formulated similar plans to invest $1 billion to produce 12-15 movies a year exclusively for theaters, Bloomberg reported in November.

Amazon closed its $8.5 billion deal to acquire MGM early last year.

""Now that streaming has begun to mature, the pendulum is certainly swinging back toward a balance as these distributors see the kind of success they've been leaving on the table with an all-in approach to streaming,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, told Yahoo Finance at the time.

More streamers committing to the ""lucrative"" theatrical window will also help fill in calendar gaps for cinemas, in Robbins' view.

Theaters, still reeling from the pandemic, have yet to see ticket sales bounce back to pre-pandemic levels ‚Äî despite blockbuster showings from films like ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and ""Creed III.""

According to data from Comscore, the domestic box office brought in an estimated $7.5 billion last year, representing a roughly 70% year-over-year increase but still 30% below pre-pandemic levels when total North American ticket sales hit $11 billion.

However, investments from companies like Amazon and Apple could help the battered industry recovery at a faster pace.

""Comcast's Universal spent about $1 billion a year in 2018-19 on film releases, generating some $1.6 billion in average domestic box-office receipts. This suggests that Apple and Amazon could each bring in roughly $1-$1.5 billion in ticket sales, boosting the box office by over 20% vs. an estimated $8.3-$8.5 billion in 2023,"" Geetha Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence media analyst, wrote in reaction to the news.

Ranganathan added the developments could also up the ante for Netflix (NFLX), which has been largely resistant to the theatrical window.

Apple and Amazon's reported plans comes at a time when many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. Apple and Amazon have increased their respective streaming and content investments, while cutting costs in other areas.

Most recently, Amazon revealed it will be cutting 9,000 jobs after laying off 18,000 employees in January. Bloomberg reported Apple has pushed back product launches, delayed bonuses, and cut budgets in order to avoid layoffs.

As Apple looks to increase its streaming presence, the company has leaned further into sports, reportedly weighing bids to secure the streaming rights for English football games after locking in a 10-year, $2.5 billion deal with Major League Soccer and Friday night Major League Baseball showings.

On Wednesday, the company announced it will now require a $6.99 subscription to stream MLB games on Apple TV+. Previously, users were able to watch the games for free after signing up for an account.

Oct 26 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq index fell on Wednesday as disappointing results and warnings from Microsoft and Alphabet sparked losses in megacap companies and raised fears of slowing economic growth, while an upbeat earnings report from Visa kept the Dow afloat.

Microsoft Corp posted its lowest sales growth in five years and forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, while Alphabet reported downbeat ad sales and warned of a slowdown in advertising spending.

Shares of both companies fell about 7.5% each, dragging down Amazon.com and Apple, which are scheduled to report results later this week. They were down 4.0% and 1.3%, respectively.

""Microsoft results point to this idea that corporate IT budgets are coming under pressure and Alphabet missing estimates speaks to perhaps a consumer that is potentially running out of steam and both point to a slowing economy,"" said Josh Wein, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.

U.S.-listed shares of Spotify Technology lost 7.0% as margins came under pressure from a slowdown in ad growth, while Texas Instruments fell 3.9% after the chipmaker gave a bleak fourth-quarter outlook on lower demand.

The extensive weakness in the tech sector comes despite a drop in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which fell for the second straight day on rising bets over a slowdown in the pace of interest-rate hikes.

Expectations of a less-hawkish Federal Reserve have helped Wall Street's main indexes notch three straight sessions of gains, but downbeat earnings and forecasts suggested the Fed's rapid interest rate hikes are slowing the economy.

The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver its fourth 75 basis-point hike in its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting against the backdrop of recent data pointing to economic softness.

""I don't see this Fed as one that's going to look at one data point and say we're getting close to the end, so 75 bps is probably baked in for December,"" Wein said.

Analysts have set the bar low for third-quarter reporting season, with aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth seen at 3.3% year-on-year, down from 4.5% at the start of the month, according to Refinitiv data.

At 10:01 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 124.32 points, or 0.39%, at 31,961.06, the S&P 500 was down 13.71 points, or 0.36%, at 3,845.40, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 149.98 points, or 1.34%, at 11,049.14.

Visa Inc jumped 5%, boosting the Dow, after the payments processor topped quarterly profit estimates on strong travel demand.

Executives across the technology sector are talking about how to operate AI like ChatGPT while accounting for the high expense. The wildly popular chatbot from OpenAI, which can draft prose and answer search queries, has ""eye-watering"" computing costs of a couple or more cents per conversation, the startup's Chief Executive Sam Altman has said on Twitter.

In an interview, Alphabet's Chairman John Hennessy told Reuters that having an exchange with AI known as a large language model likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search, though fine-tuning will help reduce the expense quickly.

Even with revenue from potential chat-based search ads, the technology could chip into the bottom line of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet with several billion dollars of extra costs, analysts said. Its net income was nearly $60 billion in 2022.

Morgan Stanley estimated that Google's 3.3 trillion search queries last year cost roughly a fifth of a cent each, a number that would increase depending on how much text AI must generate. Google, for instance, could face a $6-billion hike in expenses by 2024 if ChatGPT-like AI were to handle half the queries it receives with 50-word answers, analysts projected. Google is unlikely to need a chatbot to handle navigational searches for sites like Wikipedia.

Others arrived at a similar bill in different ways. For instance, SemiAnalysis, a research and consulting firm focused on chip technology, said adding ChatGPT-style AI to search could cost Alphabet $3 billion, an amount limited by Google's in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, along with other optimizations.

What makes this form of AI pricier than conventional search is the computing power involved. Such AI depends on billions of dollars of chips, a cost that has to be spread out over their useful life of several years, analysts said. Electricity likewise adds costs and pressure to companies with carbon-footprint goals.

The process of handling AI-powered search queries is known as ""inference,"" in which a ""neural network"" loosely modeled on the human brain's biology infers the answer to a question from prior training.

In a traditional search, by contrast, Google's web crawlers have scanned the internet to compile an index of information. When a user types a query, Google serves up the most relevant answers stored in the index.

Alphabet's Hennessy told Reuters, ""It's inference costs you have to drive down,"" calling that ""a couple year problem at worst.""

Alphabet is facing pressure to take on the challenge despite the expense. Earlier this month, its rival Microsoft held a high-profile event at its Redmond, Washington headquarters to show off plans to embed AI chat technology into its Bing search engine, with top executives taking aim at Google's search market share of 91%, by Similarweb's estimate.

A day later, Alphabet talked about plans to improve its search engine, but a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard showed the system answering a question inaccurately, fomenting a stock slide that shaved $100 billion off its market value.

Microsoft later drew scrutiny of its own when its AI reportedly made threats or professed love to test users, prompting the company to limit long chat sessions it said ""provoked"" unintended answers.

Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has told analysts that the upside from gaining users and advertising revenue outweighed expenses as the new Bing rolls out to millions of consumers. ""That's incremental gross margin dollars for us, even at the cost to serve that we're discussing,"" she said.

And another Google competitor, CEO of search engine You.com Richard Socher, said adding an AI chat experience as well as applications for charts, videos and other generative tech raised expenses between 30% and 50%. ""Technology gets cheaper at scale and over time,"" he said.

A source close to Google cautioned it's early to pin down exactly how much chatbots might cost because efficiency and usage vary widely depending on the technology involved, and AI already powers products like search.

Still, footing the bill is one of two main reasons why search and social media giants with billions of users have not rolled out an AI chatbot overnight, said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's chief technology officer.

""One is accuracy, and the second is you have to scale this in the right way,"" he said.

For years, researchers at Alphabet and elsewhere have studied how to train and run large language models more cheaply.

Bigger models require more chips for inference and therefore cost more. AI that dazzles consumers for its human-like authority has ballooned in size, reaching 175 billion so-called parameters, or different values that the algorithm takes into account, for the model OpenAI updated into ChatGPT. Cost also varies by the length of a user's query, as measured in ""tokens"" or pieces of words.

One senior technology executive told Reuters that such AI remained cost-prohibitive to put in millions of consumers' hands.

""These models are very expensive, and so the next level of invention is going to be reducing the cost of both training these models and inference so that we can use it in every application,"" the executive said on condition of anonymity.

For now, computer scientists inside OpenAI have figured out how to optimize inference costs through complex code that makes chips run more efficiently, a person familiar with the effort said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately comment.

A longer-term issue is how to shrink the number of parameters in an AI model 10 or even 100 times, without losing accuracy.

""How you cull (parameters away) most effectively, that's still an open question,"" said Naveen Rao, who formerly ran Intel's AI chip efforts and now works to lower AI computing costs through his startup MosaicML.

In the meantime, some have considered charging for access, like OpenAI's $20 per month subscription for better ChatGPT service. Technology experts also said a workaround is applying smaller AI models to simpler tasks, which Alphabet is exploring.

The company said this month a ""smaller model"" version of its massive LaMDA AI technology will power its chatbot Bard, requiring ""significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users.""

Asked about chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, Hennessy said at a conference called TechSurge last week that more focused models, rather than one system doing everything, would help ""tame the cost.""",Using AI like ChatGPT costs more than other internet searches.

Valero Energy‚Äôs shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+34.1% vs. +3.8%). The company offers the most diversified refinery base in the industry, with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.



Importantly, Valero is best placed to reap profits from solid refining margins, mainly owing to the strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs. The majority of Valero‚Äôs refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to the export facilities.



The Gulf Coast presence helped Valero expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results due to increased refinery throughput volumes. The company intends to quadruple renewable diesel production capacity by 2023.

However, supply-chain issues remain a challenge for Roper. The rising cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company‚Äôs bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds are added concerns.

Shares of American Electric Power have declined -11.8% over the past year against the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry‚Äôs decline of -12.9%.

Also, a weak solvency position and unfavorable financial ratios indicate that the company might face difficulties meeting debt obligations.



Nevertheless, American Electric‚Äôs has a stable earnings base of approximately 5.5 million customers across more than 11 states. The company owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system and more than 224,000 miles of distribution lines.



American Electric plans to invest $40 billion in regulated operations, contracted renewables and wires during the 2023-2027 period to achieve long-term earnings growth of 6-7%.

Trump remains the frontrunner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination‚Äîregularly leading all other candidates by double-digit margins in early polls, despite his recent spate of criminal indictments. Candidates like Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have typically drawn only single-digit support in the same polls.

In the wake of Trump's recent federal indictment for the mishandling of classified national defense documents, Ramaswamy was one of the few candidates to outright decry the case as a Democratic plot to jail Trump and hurt his political fortunes. The businessman has pledged to pardon Trump if elected and called for others in the 2024 field to make the same pledge as well.

During a Sunday appearance on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream confronted Ramaswamy on his ""aggressive,"" full-throated defense of Trump and criticism of the legitimacy of the U.S. justice system, citing a New York Times article raising concerns that his rhetoric might cause ""lasting damage.""

""Do you acknowledge that possibility? Are you worried about it?"" Bream asked the GOP presidential contender.

""I'm more worried, Shannon, about the opposite possibility, which is when the Department of Justice weaponized police force against people based on their political viewpoints,"" Ramaswamy said. ""That already undermines trust in the justice system.""

Ramaswamy has regularly received negligible polling support, lower than other longshot candidates that have yet to enter the race, sometimes so low that he is not mentioned in the rundown of candidates. The current Real Clear Politics average of polls shows the GOP contender with about 2.4 percent support among Republican voters‚Äîwell behind Trump's nearly 53 percent and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' approximately 20 percent.

Some observers have said candidates like Ramaswamy are angling for roles in a hypothetical second Trump administration by avoiding overt criticisms of him on the campaign trail, and offering support of him in his various legal battles. For his part, the conservative businessman says that he aims to win the GOP nomination, saying he was inspired by Trump's political outsider campaign in 2016.

The federal indictment issued against Trump last week, which Ramaswamy dismissed as purely political in nature, leveled dozens of charges against the former president, including 31 counts of willfully retaining documents containing sensitive national security information in violation of the Espionage Act. It also lays out extensive evidence highlighting Trump's alleged attempts to obstruct attempts by the federal government to retrieve the documents he had in his possession.

Trump maintains his innocence, repeatedly dismissing the charges as politically motivated. He entered a ""not guilty"" plea during his arraignment in Florida last Tuesday.

A few GOP presidential candidates, including Christie and former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, have been openly critical of Trump's conduct in the wake of the federal indictment, with the latter calling for him to drop out of the race. Mike Pence, Trump's former vice president, also said that he could not defend the conduct described in the indictment if it is accurate.

1,good,True,positive,8713,"Russia forced to use its own accident-prone jet technology as sanctions hit airlines.

Russia is attempting to revive its accident-prone Cold War-era aviation industry after being pummelled by Western sanctions. Western sanctions means parts from these companies can no longer be supplied to Russia after its attack on Ukraine.

""Foreign aircraft will drop out of the fleet,"" Rostec told newswire Reuters. ""We believe that this process is irreversible and Boeing and Airbus planes will never be delivered to Russia.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Flag carrier Aeroflot and other Russian airlines have bought hundreds of Boeing and Airbus jets in recent decades in a bid to leave behind the rickety safety record of domestically made Soviet-era jets. 

Mr Cunningham said it would be quicker and easier to keep old jets flying by cannibalising parts from retired models, like Iran has since the 1979 Revolution to keep its own fleet flying without Western parts.

Rostec controls United Aircraft Corporation, the umbrella for Russian aircraft makers such as Ilyushin, Tupolev and Mikoyan.

Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, most Russian aircraft makers have focused on building military planes like the Mikoyan MiG-35 and the Sukhoi Su-75.",Russia forced to use its own accident-prone jet technology as sanctions hit airlines,BA,Resource Transformation,Aerospace & Defence,Boeing Co,2022-11-07T11:01:01+00:00,2022-11-07,2022-11-07T11:01:01+00:00,[{'name': 'Finance'}],"U.S. equity futures rose modestly in pre-market trading Monday as investors geared up for another week of potentially stock-moving events: the Nov. 8 midterm elections and October consumer price data.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each gained roughly 0.4%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were up by roughly the same margin after the index posted its worst weekly loss since January.

A batch of downbeat corporate news has renewed focus on the wreck across technology stocks after disappointing earnings last week dragged the sector's heaviest hitters ‚Äî Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) ‚Äî to losses of at least 10% last week.

Apple (AAPL) shares slumped 1.2% before the open after the company said in a statement Sunday it expects fewer shipments of its newest premium iPhones than previously anticipated after COVID lockdowns in China dented operations at its biggest smartphone maker Foxconn's factory.

Elsewhere among tech giants, Facebook parent Meta (META), which was down 73% year-to-date as of Friday's close and is the worst performer in the S&P 500 index this year, is now expected to begin large-scale layoffs this week, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. Shares rose nearly 4% in early hours trading.

Election Day may keep investors on edge as dozens of key races determine which political party has control over the Congressional agenda. Wall Street has historically preferred a split Congress or White House, with gridlock making it difficult to execute any potentially unfavorable legislation.

‚ÄúGoing back to 1929 and excluding the Great Depression, some of the best annual returns for the S&P 500 have been seen when the sitting President does not have full control over both sides of Congress,‚Äù Verdence Capital Advisors CIO Megan Horneman and CEO Leo Kelly said in emailed commentary. ‚ÄúThis may be because markets do not expect major changes to law with a split Congress.‚Äù

While political campaigns have placed fiscal leadership into the spotlight, some strategists argue that midterm outcomes rarely influence financial markets outside of short-term volatility.

‚ÄúThe markets are influenced more by expected financial conditions and economic catalysts than by midterm elections,‚Äù Morningstar Chief U.S. Market Strategists Dave Sekera said in a recent note. ‚ÄúHistorically, some analysis has shown that equity markets have tended to underperform in the runup to midterms and then outperform thereafter.‚Äù

October‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Thursday, however, is sure to sway equity markets. Another hot inflation reading may solidify expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise its key interest rate more than initially forecast.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see headline CPI at an annual 7.9% for the month, a moderation from September‚Äôs year-over-year increase of 8.2%. Core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy components of the measure, is projected to come in at 6.5%, little changed from 6.6% last month.

‚ÄúHeadline inflation has likely peaked, but core inflation hit its post-pandemic high just last month,‚Äù Baird Investment Strategy Analyst Ross Mayfield said in an emailed note. ‚ÄúWhile the Fed has hinted that they see reasons to slow their pace, the rate of inflation ‚Äì even if it has peaked ‚Äì remains far too high for comfort.‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil the Fed signals the ‚Äòpivot‚Äô is near, things could remain challenging,‚Äù he added.

A number of analyst calls on Monday looked at how current work in AI at Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) is impacting their businesses in both positive and negative ways. ""Advances in AI are coming faster than we've ever seen,"" former Google CEO Eric Schmidt told CNBC Monday. ""I used to think it would take 20 years. Now I think it's 5 to 10."" The broader market performance this year says it all. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has rallied 28% year to date, outperforming the S & P 500 's 13% gain during the same period. ""There are people who want to kill artificial intelligence and all of its future successes. But they don't have the power to stop AI."" Jim said in his Sunday column . Here are Monday's analyst calls and our take, too. Alphabet The news: Analysts at UBS lowered their rating on Alphabet to neutral from buy but increased their price target to $132 per share from $123. The firm's downgrade stems from concerns that generative AI responses to Google Search inquiries could displace traditional results that have ads on them. Analysts said the company can figure out how to monetize its new search engine over time ‚Äî but for now, they see ""medium-term revenue risk."" Shares of Alphabet on Monday fell more than 3% to under $119 apiece. GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet stock's year-to-date performance. The Club's take: We understand UBS' concern that new AI-powered technology could challenge search ads. However, it's difficult to say whether that will be the case. In the note, the analysts seem to take both sides of the argument by saying, ""over time, GenAI could expand engagement and unlock new monetization opportunities but visibility here remains low today and may see near term headwinds."" In the long-term, generative AI should be an asset to Google and Alphabet as a whole. We took profits in Alphabet in early May but still have plenty left. We're not looking to sell more now but would not buy at these high levels either. We'd rather wait for the stock to come in more. The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit concerning Google's dominance in the online ad market has been an overhang on the stock in addition to competition from fellow Club name Microsoft (MSFT), which has been leading the charge in AI this year. Meta Platforms The news: UBS also raised its price target on Meta Platforms to $335 from $300 while keeping a buy rating on shares. Analysts expect the company's use of generative AI to be the ""next leg to shares,"" and its use of AI tools should help the company ""be viewed as an AI winner."" Meta has been integrating gen AI across its platforms to boost user time spent on its apps. UBS also highlights Meta's upcoming releases of more chatbots or ""AI Assistants"" which will help users create more content, and engage with audiences and businesses. Analysts predict chatbots could increase full-year 2024 revenue by $7.5 billion if the company monetizes just 5% of search queries on Facebook alone. Meta remains a top pick at UBS as the tech giant's gen AI push in advertising provides a huge value proposition to its advertising customers. META YTD mountain Meta stock's year-to-date performance. The Club's take: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone all in on AI in his year of efficiency. He has been using AI-powered technology to adeptly counter the impact of Apple 's (AAPL) privacy changes. As a result, there's been a huge acceleration in ads and a surge in user activity on Facebook and Instagram as Reels (Meta's answer to TikTok) are being pushed to social media audiences. Zuckerberg has also been keen on keeping costs down with several rounds of layoffs this year and spending cutbacks in the metaverse. These are two factors which are expected to improve its financial results in coming quarters. These efficiency moves have also been major wins for the stock, which has gained 134% in 2023. Though Meta shares fell 3.5% to $278 each Monday. We also see the tech giant's Monday release of Meta Quest+, its new virtual reality subscription service, as another positive. We love subscription services for their recurring revenues because they are predictable and easy to forecast. It's what we value about the ecosystem of Club name Apple, which recently released its first mixed reality headset: Vision Pro. Amazon The news: Roth MKM named Amazon as its No. 1 mega-cap pick, in a research note Monday followed by Meta and Alphabet. All three mega caps, the analyst said, will benefit from the ""ongoing GenAI wave."" The firm increased its price target on AMZN stock to $155 from $130 based on a sum of the parts (SOTP) valuation. It kept its buy rating. Reacceleration of revenue growth at Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the fourth quarter of this year, should be a catalyst for the stock, analysts said. They also characterized Amazon's retail operating margins as underappreciated due to cost cuts and workforce reductions. Shares of AMZN dropped 1.5% lower to just over $127 each. AMZN YTD mountain Amazon stock's year-to-date performance. The Club's take: While coming out of a cyclically lower year, Amazon's AWS business should accelerate closer to the end of the year because of its advancements in AI. The multifaceted mega cap will get better at increasing efficiencies through cost cutting measures across its business in areas that don't have a clear vision on return on investment. We also expect operating leverage to improve as the company grows into the excess warehouse and logistics capacity that was built during the Covid pandemic when e-commerce demand was off the charts. Like the analysts at Roth, we also anticipate reaccelerating AWS growth into next year, which should make the stock more valuable.

The technology behemoth reported results after the bell Thursday that fell short of analysts' revenue expectations. Amazon also signaled a slowdown in its Amazon Web Services division, which recorded its slowest growth since at least 2014 , and shared weaker-than-expected guidance for the current period. The stock was last down more than 13% in premarket trading. Analysts trimmed price targets and estimates to reflect a broader macro slowdown at the e-commerce giant following the results, with analysts at Deutsche Bank and Wolfe Research saying it's time to ""batten down the hatches."" However, most analysts remain bullish on the company's long-term trajectory, maintaining their outperform and buy ratings on the stock. ""Combined with wobbles on revenue momentum for both AWS and Retail, and suddenly the Amazon hiding place doesn't look good,"" wrote Bernstein's Mark Shmulik in a note to clients Friday, believing a ""redemption story"" is ahead for the company and equating the recent tech meltdown to ""trying to turn a big freight ship."" ""The good news here is that the story isn't broken, it's just pushed out into 2023 while Q4 may get worse before it gets better... pretty much Google 2.0,"" the analyst wrote. That said, analysts across the board trimmed price targets and estimates to reflect the broader macro pressures. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan said in a note to clients Friday that the bank remains a believer in the company's long-term trajectory and its cloud computing business despite the results. He trimmed the company's price target to $165 from $175 a share, suggesting a near 50% upside for the stock. ""Based on our work, we remain convinced in a multi-year operating income margin expansion story for Amazon on the back of improved eCommerce margins, less International losses & higher profit margin mix contribution from AWS and advertising,"" he wrote. RBC Capital Markets' Brad Erickson called the company a ""long-term secular winner"" with strong earnings power and margin leverage once it can overcome macro pressures. Despite current setbacks expect Amazon to resurge as a winner coming out of a recession, said Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak in a note to clients Friday. ""AMZN is seeing the consumer/enterprise slowdown more than thought, leading to lower rev and a flatter slope of volume-based efficiencies,"" he said, reducing his price target to $140 a share. ""But we think AMZN is positioned to take share through a downturn, see forward investment levels low, and the potential for cost rationalization."" Bank of America's Justin Post said the weak outlook at Amazon may also signal that the feared recession looming ahead is already underway. He trimmed his price target on the stock to $137 from $157 a share, suggesting 23% upside ahead for the stocks. ""It is evident from the 4Q guide that AMZN is not immune to the challenging macroeconomic environment worldwide,"" said Wolfe Research's Deepak Mathivanan in a note to clients.

The firm's U.S. Large Cap Growth Responsibility Index (CGJAX) is up 27% this year, rallying in near harmony with growth stocks. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) is also up around 30% in 2023. The fund, which is rated five stars by Morningstar, was conceived in June 2015 ‚Äî though Calvert has been focused on environmental, social and corporate governance investing for decades. All of the approximately 580 holdings in the fund meet the firm's ""principles,"" Calvert's name for its environmental, social and governance framework. ""It's a way to give investors access to growth from a style standpoint but are also meeting and adequately managing their financially material ESG risks and opportunities,"" said Jade Huang, Calvert managing director of applied responsible investment solutions. CGJAX YTD mountain The fund's 2023 'Rules based and data driven' The fund, which has a minimum investment of $5,000 and fee of 0.49% for its A class, tracks an index created by Calvert of growth stocks that meet the principles. Here's how the stocks are selected: Calvert uses an equation to determine a company's growth score. It then selects the top 70% of stocks based on that score, screening for the 1,000-largest U.S. names. The names in the top 30% of the stocks screened receive the largest portfolio allocations, while the rest receive a smaller allocation. ""It's all kind of mathematical,"" said Huang, who has been at Calvert since 2006. ""It's very rules based and data driven."" Huang said the process hasn't changed much besides some minor tweaks to the methodology. Still, only stocks that meet the principles, which include issues like carbon reduction and support of diversity, can be included. But what she said has changed is corporate America's relationship with ESG. She said companies are now better at managing ESG risks than they were even a few years ago. They have also improved their disclosure processes. That comes as ESG finds itself in hot political water despite growing awareness and acceptance on Wall Street and among retail investors . As a firm, Calvert is considered one of the early adopters of ESG. ""What is reflective in the index would be progress around sustainability issues,"" she said. 'Consistent approach' Fitting of any growth fund, a handful of large tech names are among the biggest holdings as of June 30, per Morningstar. Apple is the largest holding at 11%, followed by Microsoft at 9%. While the fund has more than 500 holdings decided on by the firm's equation, the 10 biggest holdings make up more than two-fifths of the fund's total, per Morningstar data. Nvidia is the fund's fifth-biggest holding. Shares have surged more than 230% this year as investors bought into the artificial intelligence mania. Though the fund has an undeniable tilt toward technology and other growth names, it doesn't perfectly reflect the sector. Facebook-parent Meta is not included, for example, because it doesn't meet the firm's principles. Huang also noted the fund is underweight on Tesla . That can help explain why it's underperforming the Nasdaq this year despite beating the broader market. The Nasdaq-100 index is up 41% in 2023. Morningstar analyst Lan Anh Tran also noted the exclusion of major tech players such as Snowflake and Fortinet can impact its performance compared with its peer group. The fund ranks in the 51st percentile among peers this year, slightly down from the previous two years. However, the fund has a strong long-term track record, averaging an annual return of 13.3% over the past five years. That puts it in the 13th percentile among funds in that category over that time. ""This fund still offers a broadly diversified option for investors looking for a balance between ESG and growth stocks,"" Tran wrote when rating the fund at the end of last year. ""Even though it makes some active bets on sectors and individual stocks, the fund's valuation and profitability metrics look similar to those of the category average and Russell 1000 Growth Index."" Tran also said the fund's relatively low expense ratio can give it an ""edge."" Growth-factor investing came back in vogue this year after the 2022 sell-off, which was sparked in part by high inflation and the Federal Reserve raising rates to combat it. This trend seems also seems to benefit Calvert's fund. The fund also benefits from having a more data-driven approach to picking stocks, Huang wrote.

Supporters of efforts to revamp antitrust laws, as well as update kids‚Äô online safety regulations, hoped to add such measures to the omnibus funding bill in a last-ditch effort to pass them this year, but a swath of tech bills were left out, according to text released early Tuesday.

A couple of less controversial antitrust reform bills, including one to update merger filing fees and another to let states choose the venue for antitrust enforcement cases, made it into the text. But on the whole, the multi-year bipartisan effort to reform competition bills to target tech giants appears to have failed as the current Congress winds down.

Supporters had been pushing for two other antitrust bills, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which aims to limit tech companies from preferencing their own products and services, and the Open App Markets Act, which aims to impose additional regulations on dominant app stores. The proposals came out of a House Judiciary Committee investigation into the market power of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, now under the parent company name Meta.

Both of the bills advanced out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with bipartisan support, but appear to be falling by the wayside without coming up for a vote on the floor of either chamber as the 117th Congress comes to a close.

The Open App Markets Act particularly faced a last-minute opposition push from the tech industry. The Chamber of Progress, which names Apple, Google, Meta and Amazon as corporate partners, launched an ad on connected TV earlier this month slamming the bill over accusations that it would ‚Äúforce companies to provide a soapbox to dangerous extremists.‚Äù

Supporters of the antitrust bill said accusations like the one Chamber of Progress pushed were red herrings and not an accurate portrayal of the legislation.

Although the antitrust bills had support on both sides of the aisle, House Republicans set to take control next year have set their sights on prioritizing content moderation concerns. The focus of top House GOP members like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is slated to chair the Judiciary Committee next year, on allegations of anti-conservative ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù will likely push the antitrust bills to the back burner.

In addition to antitrust reform, there was bipartisan support in Congress this year for efforts to improve kids‚Äô online safety laws. Two bills in particular, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) 2.0, gained steam. The bills advanced with bipartisan support out of the Senate Commerce committee.

Parent advocates whose children‚Äôs deaths were tied to social media met with lawmakers throughout the past couple of months in a last-minute push to pass the bills. But they ultimately failed to make it into the omnibus spending bill.

KOSA in particular faced an opposition campaign near the end of the year from a group of human rights and LGBTQ organizations, as well as the Center for Democracy and Technology, who argued that the bill would actually make kids less safe online and disproportionately harm marginalized youth.

But parent advocates who spoke to members of Congress, as well as kids‚Äô safety groups such as Fairplay and ParentsTogether, said the proposal would make the internet safer for kids by adding new requirements for how companies treat young users.

KOSA would create a duty of care for social media platforms to prevent and mitigate harm to minors, and require them to put the strictest privacy settings in place as the default for such users.

COPPA 2.0 would update the 1998 children‚Äôs privacy law to include protections for minors aged 12-16, who are not covered by the existing law. It would also add new protections such as a ban on targeted advertising to minors.

Some less controversial tech bills did make it into the omnibus text, including two of the antitrust proposals spawned by the House investigation. The spending bill includes the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, which would update filing fees to increase them for larger deals, and the Venue for State Antitrust Enforcement, which would allow states to choose where antitrust cases are heard, including cases that are pending by the date of the bill being enacted.

The INFORM Act, which aims to verify the identity of online sellers on virtual marketplaces, is also included in the bill.

‚Ä¢ The Deepwater Asset Management managing partner thinks firms have room to cut.
‚Ä¢ He also sees them getting tighter on the ""laptop generation"" who refuse to return to the office.

More layoffs could be on their way at big tech firms as bosses prepare to tighten on the ""laptop generation,"" according to Gene Munster.

In an interview with Insider, Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said companies weren't done with their efforts to slash headcount, despite a drastic wave of layoffs in recent months.

The investor, who expects layoffs to be announced as soon as next-quarter earnings, believes both Microsoft and Google are the two top candidates to make further cuts to their workforce even though they're riding an AI boom.

Microsoft's first round of layoffs in January hit 10,000 workers, while Google's impacted around 12,000. Munster believes these cuts, which he said were ""representative of what the topline is doing,"" have been modest compared with those made by rivals such as Meta.

""I think that there are more cuts coming even from the ones that are in a good position like Microsoft,"" Munster said. ""It seems like that's still a vast open opportunity for them when it comes to margins.""

Microsoft and Google did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Munster's comments come as tech companies shift their tone away from growth to focus on efficiency. This is a bid to correct course on the hiring sprees they embarked on during the pandemic amid an economic downturn.

The efficiency plans have led companies such as Meta to target layers of middle managers that prominent Silicon Valley voices. These include Elon Musk, who has called out such employees as being members of remote-working ""laptop classes,"" who he considered to be detached from the day-to-day reality of operations.

Munster thinks that ""there has been this laptop generation"" that ""some of these tech companies are going to tighten on."" He also sees managers pushing workers to get back into the office given the belief that it will give them ""a competitive advantage.""

Remote workers have been especially worried about layoffs. A survey of 80,000 workers published earlier this year by software firm Humu found remote workers were 32% more likely than office workers to feel anxious upon learning about layoffs.

Since 2022, more than 360,000 workers have lost their jobs in the tech sector, according to online tracker Layoffs.fyi.

Friday‚Äôs jobs report will be closely watched by investors for any signs that the labor market is finally beginning to crack.

The U.S. jobs market has remained red hot in an otherwise cooling economy buffeted by high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and a crisis of confidence in the banking system.

Even as strains in the banking and manufacturing sectors suggest the economy could be heading toward a recession, the unemployment rate is hovering at its lowest level in more than 50 years.

The resilience of the labor market has been good news for everyone, except the Federal Reserve, given that Fed officials fear a tight jobs market will fuel higher wages and in turn drive inflation.

That has complicated deliberations among central bank officials about when to pause after aggressively raising interest rates for more than a year.

It has also spurred a debate on Wall Street about whether stocks can sustain their rally if the Fed keeps raising rates, or holds them at elevated levels.

The S&P 500 has climbed 8.9% this year, largely on hopes that the central bank‚Äôs work was nearly done. But investors‚Äô interest-rate expectations shifted again last week: They no longer see a rate cut this year, and instead are increasingly wagering that a June increase is in the cards.

‚ÄúWhether you‚Äôre a stock-market bull or bear right now rests on your opinion of the labor market,‚Äù said Jawad Mian, founder of macro-advisory firm Stray Reflections.

Some investors have long feared a tight labor market would force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, potentially pushing the economy into a recession. But Mian said the health of the jobs market proves consumers are strong enough to withstand tight policy‚Äîwhich should allow stocks to continue rallying.

The May jobs report is expected to show the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.5% while the economy added 190,000 jobs and wages rose from the prior month, though at a slower pace, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. In April, the jobless rate fell to 3.4%, matching the lowest reading since 1969. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that job openings were stronger than expected in April and layoffs fell.

Most economists agree that any recession this year would likely be relatively short and shallow, partly because the corporate earnings picture is already improving. Companies in the S&P 500 reported a mere 1.3% decline in first-quarter profits versus the 5.9% drop forecast by analysts on March 31, according to FactSet. Earnings are expected to begin growing again in the second half.

Some investors say markets are poised for a boom once the economic outlook becomes more clear. Americans have plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into money-market funds‚Äîa huge pile of cash that could enter the market if recessionary fears wane, according to Rick Rieder, BlackRock‚Äôs chief investment officer of global fixed income.

‚ÄúWe are in a historic period‚Äîthe amount of cash sitting on the sidelines is epic,‚Äù he said.

Bearish investors, on the other hand, say stocks still look expensive compared with historical averages‚Äîand valuations typically collapse during recessions. The S&P 500 is trading at 18.3 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, versus its 10-year average of 17.5.

The benchmark has fallen a median of 24% during recessions going back to 1946, according to research from Deutsche Bank.

‚ÄúI definitely think what we are seeing now is a bear-market rally. Logic and history suggest this is an unsustainable trend,‚Äù Chris Brightman, chief executive and chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, said of stocks‚Äô rally in light of the recessionary indicators flashing across markets.

Although strategists disagree whether the labor market will ultimately crack, a rise in unemployment has been a trademark of recessions in the modern era‚Äîand the rate is a key input for market forecasts.

In fact, a jump in the unemployment rate is one of the best signals that stocks are on course for a rebound after a rout, according to Bank of America analysts. Unemployment typically peaks four months after the S&P 500 bottoms in a bear market, said the analysts, who estimate the rate will top out at 4.8% in the first few months of 2024.

One sign of the labor market‚Äôs growing impact: Consumers‚Äô willingness to spend, mostly on experiences and services, has usurped goods prices as the primary driver of inflation.

‚ÄúA year ago, inflation stemmed from supply chain distortions,‚Äù said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ‚ÄúNow, a tight labor market is pushing services prices higher.‚Äù

What are the risks for stocks? A continuously hot jobs market could put upward pressure on wages, squeezing profit margins and prompting the Fed to hold rates at restrictive levels for longer. Both would drag on the stock market. But if those are the trade-offs for avoiding a deep recession, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a home run,‚Äù said Golub.

After reviewing hundreds of resumes, and talking to top executives about what they look for in a candidate, I've found that including strong keywords is one of the best ways to stand out. But many people use keywords the wrong way.

Lately, the biggest resume mistake I've been seeing people make is ""keyword stuffing"" ‚Äî or trying to use as many keywords from the job description as possible. Job seekers often do this because they believe the resume scanning software many employers use ‚Äî known as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) ‚Äî automatically rejects resumes that have too few keywords. But the primary function of an ATS is to organize applications and make the hiring process easier for recruiters. It does things like keep track of applicants and interview schedules. Generally, human eyes see every resume before big decisions are made. You may receive a rejection email that reads like an automated message, but rest assured, someone actually reviewed your resume and decided you weren't a good fit.

How to use keywords on your resume

A simple tip to remember: Use keywords with humans in mind, not machines. That means doing it in a way that is convincing and properly contextualized, rather than awkward or forced. 1. Decide what you want the hiring manager to know before you start writing. Having an idea of the impression you want the resume reader to walk away with can help you decide what keywords to prioritize. To uncover what makes you special, ask yourself questions like:
‚Ä¢ Is there a specific part of my job that I am better at compared to my peers?
‚Ä¢ Looking at my biggest wins, is there a common theme?
‚Ä¢ What does that common theme say about my strengths? The most impressive resumes tell the reader how you used your skills to create to quantifiable results. For example, let's say one of the required skills in a job description is ""Microsoft Excel."" Instead of writing ""Used Microsoft Excel to track and report load speed data,"" write ""Leveraged Microsoft Excel to automate load speed insights and decrease weekly reporting time by 50%."" A separate skills section is a great place to put keywords that don't naturally fit under your experience section. I recommend including at least nine key skills and grouping them into columns of three, spread evenly across the top of the resume. We limit ourselves to nine skills total to avoid ""keyword stuffing."" You also don't want to look like ""a jack-of-all-trades and master of none."" Jermaine L.

‚Ä¢ Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all say customers are looking for ways to lower their cloud bills.
‚Ä¢ These charts show just how much cloud growth slowed at the big three cloud providers.

The slew of recent big tech earnings confirmed what investors had been fearing ‚Äî cloud growth is slowing, especially as companies look to cut costs amid a worsening economic outlook.

That's not to say growth has come to a halt: Revenue is still rising at Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud Platform ‚Äî it's just rising at a slower rate than in previous quarters.

These charts show just how much cloud growth slowed at the big three cloud providers:

When Microsoft reported earnings results, Wall Street was shocked to see just how much cloud spending had slowed. Azure growth fell to around 30% year-over-year. In the same quarter last year, it had logged 50% growth from the year prior. Microsoft doesn't report actual revenue numbers for Azure.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged customers of Azure's cloud services were cutting spending, but said he's optimistic spending will bounce back.

Wall Street analysts were less sanguine. Analysts at RBC summed up investor sentiment: ""While we remain optimistic for a rebound in the second half once companies work through optimizations (and hopefully macro starts to show signs of recovery), we believe it is important not to get ahead of ourselves as this could prove to be transitory.""

The slowdown had analysts reevaluating their expectations for the rest of the cloud industry because Microsoft is a good barometer of overall cloud spending: It has a varied customer base and, in addition to Azure, has cloud software offerings.

Analysts also knocked down expectations for Amazon Web Services, or AWS:

Of the big three cloud providers, AWS had the slowest year-over-year growth at 20%. That's half the amount of growth it saw in Q4 of 2021.

Some analysts said that doesn't affect what really matters ‚Äî AWS's market share. It still remains ahead of its competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform in terms of actual revenue and business.

""Most will still likely focus on the lower percentage growth compared to over 30% for competitors' cloud businesses in the quarter, which we believe comes down more to scale and broader start-up exposure,"" analysts at William Blair wrote in a note to clients. ""We also note that in absolute dollar terms, Amazon continues to take share.""

Still, Wall Street was shaken by how much AWS revenue slowed. They had lowered expectations after Microsoft reported earnings a week prior, but the actual AWS results were even lower than that.

That's likely due to how widespread its customer base is. AWS has many customers in the startup space, which are generally looking to cut costs right now. Additionally, industries like financial services and advertising are getting hit with the downturn and need less computing power from their cloud providers. This is all weighing on AWS.

""AMZN is arguably the strongest, most successfully diversified company. It is also arguably, however, the coverage company most exposed to macro-economic shocks ‚Äî inflation in fuel, shipping, labor, resources,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney.

AWS's growth is expected to continue to slow even further in the quarters ahead, Amazon CFO Brian T. Olsavsky said on a call with Wall Street analysts. He said AWS's growth could notch down even further into the mid-teens this quarter, and that he couldn't predict beyond that because it's ""uncharted territory economically.""

Google's cloud infrastructure business isn't as big as Amazon's or Microsoft's, but it's also seeing a similar slowdown in growth. Google's executives echoed what their peers at Microsoft and Amazon said about customers cutting spending.

Analysts point out that 32% growth is not bad for Google, since it's still a growing business for them, and was a ""bright spot"" among its other business units.

""Fundamentally this is still a relatively premium growth rate,"" Evercore ISI's Mahaney said in a note to clients. Management spent a lot of time focusing on its path to profitability for Cloud, to which Mahaney said ""we will be patiently waiting.""

Stick with Costco Shares of Club holding Costco Wholesale (COST) were trading down more than 3% Friday morning, a day after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter results that showed weakening sales. But the stock also has a history of trading lower on quarterly earnings because the company's monthly sales reports price in a lot of potential upside. Overall, Costco delivered a solid quarter, including a beat on profit. And if the membership-only retailer were to announce a fee increase and dividend, it would likely push the stock higher. We still view Costco as the best-run retailer in the U.S. and are sticking with the company for the long run. 2.

If the results of the trial are favorable, there's a greater possibility for the medications to receive broader insurance reimbursement for weight management purposes.

A big rally for Microsoft and other Big Tech stocks is helping to prop up Wall Street on Wednesday, a day after stocks tumbled to their worst drop in a month.

The Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 was 0.2% higher in early trading, though the worries about U.S. banks that hit the market a day before remain. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 58 points, or 0.2%, at 33,589, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was leading the market with a 0.9% gain.

Tech stocks pushed upward on indexes after Microsoft reported stronger profit for the first three months of the year than analysts expected. It jumped 7%, and it carries a huge weight on the S&P 500 because it‚Äôs the second-largest stock in the index.

Tech stocks have been some of the year‚Äôs best performers so far as they‚Äôve laid off workers and made other cost cuts to improve their profitability. Hopes for a coming pause from the Federal Reserve on its barrage of hikes to interest rates have also helped them in particular.

Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet, was drifting following its earnings report. It turned a bigger profit than expected, but it also reported its first back-to-back drops in advertising revenue from a year earlier since it became a publicly traded company in 2004. Its stock was 0.7% higher after erasing an earlier loss.

More Big Tech companies are scheduled to follow with their own reports soon. Facebook‚Äôs parent company, Meta Platforms, rose 2.1% ahead of its report, which is due after trading closes for the day.

Chipotle Mexican Grill jumped 11.1%, the biggest gain in the S&P 500, after reporting stronger profit than expected. It was one of a few companies that raised hopes consumer spending could remain resilient despite a slowing economy. That‚Äôs key because it makes up the bulk of the U.S. economy.

Visa rose 1.1% in another signal for consumer spending. It also reported stronger earnings than expected.

On the opposite side of Wall Street was First Republic Bank. It lost another 16.8%, a day after it nearly halved on worries about an exodus of customers in March.

They yanked more than $100 billion out of the bank during the first three months of the year after the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rattled confidence. That doesn‚Äôt include $30 billion that big banks deposited to try to build faith in their rival.

Wall Street‚Äôs focus has been on the smaller and mid-sized banks that could suffer debilitating runs of deposits from customers, similar to the ones that toppled Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

PacWest Bancorp., another bank that‚Äôs been in investors‚Äô spotlight, rose 12% after reporting stronger results than expected and saying that its deposits have grown since late March. That may offer optimism that First Republic‚Äôs struggles could be specific to itself, rather than a symptom of deeper issues with the system.

All banks are contending with much higher interest rates, which have tightened the screws on the economy and financial markets after flying higher over the last year.

The Federal Reserve has hiked its key overnight interest rate to its highest level since 2007. It‚Äôs trying to rein in high inflation, but its main tool to do so is a notoriously blunt one. High rates slow the entire economy and hurt prices for investments.

That has many investors and economists preparing for a possible recession. Besides the cracks in the banking system, high rates have already slowed the housing, manufacturing and other markets. The job market, meanwhile, remains relatively solid.

A report on Wednesday showed that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods were stronger in March than expected.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 3.39% from 3.40% late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans.

For airlines, 2022 was an often bumpy return to profitability, driven by the combination of robust travel demand and higher airfares. Most major airlines reported higher revenue despite diminished capacity, indicating that passengers have been more than willing to pay inflated fares.

Even Southwest Airlines, where an epic failure of its outdated flight scheduling software led to a holiday meltdown with nearly 17,000 canceled flights, reported a profit of $539 million for the year.

That is in spite of a dismal fourth-quarter performance. The Dallas-based airline reported Thursday that the holiday debacle cost it up $800 million and resulted in a net loss of $220 million for the fourth quarter, compared to a $514 million profit in the same three-month period of 2019. Southwest also said it expects a net loss in the first quarter of 2023.

The airline is also facing potential legal fallout. The Department of Transportation has launched a probe into whether Southwest broken federal law by knowingly offering unrealistic scheduling options during the holidays. In addition, Southwest is also facing a class action lawsuit from a passenger who claims the carrier did not refund his tickets for canceled flights in December.

On Thursday, American Airlines reported a record fourth-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, a 16.6% increase over the same period in 2019, despite flying 6.1% less. For the three months that ended on December 31, the company reported a profit of $803 million, a notable turnaround from a loss of $931 million during the same period in 2021.

Last week, United Airlines reported a fourth-quarter revenue of $12.4 billion, roughly 14% higher than the same period in 2019, despite flying 9% less. United posted an $843 million profit for the last three months of 2022, a 31% increase over 2019.

Earlier this month, Delta Air Lines reported $13.4 billion in revenue for the final three months of 2022, 17% higher than the same quarter in 2019, despite flying 9% less. Delta reported $828 million in profit for the fourth-quarter, down from $1.1 billion in the same period in 2019.

Looking forward into 2023, challenges for airlines include delayed aircraft deliveries and protracted contract negotiations with pilot unions. The lucrative business travel volume remains 20% below 2019 levels, which many in the industry now accept as the new normal.

Still, airlines cite resilient demand as a good reason for bullishness. For the first three months of 2023, United Airlines said it expects to expand flying 20% and generate 50% more revenue than the same period of 2022.",2022 Was Hell For Air Passengers But Profitable For Airlines,non-causal,,"['IEEFA', 'A', 'ESG']","['IEEFA', 'ESG']",[],"['IEEFA', 'A', 'MCO', 'ESG']",0.99416095

The week is starting off on a muted tone after closing lower on Friday. Mixed economic data is confirming traders‚Äô expectations that interest rates will continue to rise this spring.

Most futures traders are expecting a quarter of a percentage point increase when the Federal Reserve next meets in May.

Big banks including JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM) scored record revenue in the first quarter as rising rates helped boost interest income. But investors will be focused on results from smaller banks, and what they say about deposit outflows after turmoil in the banking sector in March.

A downturn in demand for loans could also pinch smaller banks if companies decide to scale back activity in case of a recession later this year.

In recent years, the logistics industry has invested heavily in last-mile capacity, the final leg of the customer-facing supply chain. A recent study estimated this ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù niche of the logistics market alone will grow from $25 billion to $72 billion by the end of 2025. ‚ÄúLast mile‚Äù in a traditional retail supply chain typically entails moving products from a retailer‚Äôs distribution center to a physical store. But in the past decade, the rise of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer supply chains has upended that model, creating a scramble for last-mile logistics capacity across the United States, capable of delivering packages to every consumer‚Äôs residential address instead of a smaller network of retail locations.

For companies like Amazon and other e-commerce-based businesses that don‚Äôt rely on physical storefronts, last mile is a vital element of their customer experience. However, the last mile also tends to be the most laborious and expensive part of a delivery‚Äôs logistics costs, with its numerous stops and low drop sizes. For this reason, retailers, distributors and e-commerce pure-plays are constantly seeking ways to increase speed and efficiency, with Amazon Same-Day and 2-Day Delivery setting the pace for operational tempos across the entire supply chain.

During the height of the recent supply chain crisis, attention shifted to port congestion and especially long delays for unloading container ships. Since then, the backlog of ships and unloaded goods has mostly returned to healthier pre-Covid-19 levels (e.g., the Port of Los Angeles just recorded its most productive month ever). What doesn‚Äôt get as much attention, however, is the pesky middle mile‚Äîthat intermediary leg of the supply chain where products are unloaded from docked ships, moved to port terminals and placed onto trucks and trains to travel to retailers‚Äô distribution centers. Middle-mile logistics is ripe for speed and efficiency improvements, and it‚Äôs crucial to know what in this arena may be causing delays and what this may be costing you.

Many enterprise customers rely heavily on third-party logistics (3PL) platform providers to manage the warehousing and transportation needs of the middle mile, which include the costs of port operations, customs, trade compliance, stevedores and drayage providers. These providers, who often serve many enterprise customers simultaneously, can quickly become overwhelmed for any number of reasons, including labor shortages, weather-induced delays and congestion during peak times. When such a provider or one of their sub-contractors becomes overwhelmed, orders can be delayed and expediting fees can spike, leading to added costs and eroded margins.

Many 3PL providers are beginning to leverage AI and machine learning in a plethora of use cases to manage highly complex supply chains and maximize middle miles, ranging from automated warehouses to autonomous pallet packing to predictive yard management and logistics network optimization and more. Even still, because different embedded elements of these middle miles are controlled by different providers, the cost elements are opaque to teams who support supply chain operations. How do long wait times for truckers at ports impact logistics costs? What are the benefits of using a provider that offers an automated warehouse? Procurement teams often don‚Äôt have enough cost element data to determine the risks that poorly managed middle miles can pose to overall supply chain performance.

This means that as digital technology becomes more ubiquitous, enterprise procurement teams will need to be very mindful of the way logistics are procured. As the procurement of last-mile logistics is set to increase, enterprises will also increasingly be rethinking how they buy services and components of their middle miles, ranging from warehousing to specialized services. And just as AI and ML can help manufacturers with the procurement of their direct goods‚Äîquickly surfacing preferred supplier and predictive prices based on multiple attributes like quality, availability and cost‚Äîso too can retailers, distributors and e-commerce groups benefit by identifying the ideal middle mile providers and cost structures based on the relevant context-sensitive variables.

More specifically, here‚Äôs how AI and ML can help in procuring middle-mile logistics:
‚Ä¢ Real-time programmatic flagging of lead time changes: An enterprise customer may have had a traditionally good experience with a particular provider, but it becomes critical to programmatically identify exceptions and surface them to decision-makers in real time. If a preferred provider offers a longer lead time than usual, this is a clear sign the provider may be overwhelmed and if engaged now, the enterprise customer may wind up at the end of their line. Real-time exception monitoring can help enterprise customers avoid going with a constrained lane and provide recommendations on the next best option.
‚Ä¢ Tier 2 cost structure visibility: If a commonly used logistics provider‚Äôs costs suddenly change, such aberrations should also be automatically flagged, giving organizations the chance to ask the provider ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and gain insight into Tier 2 cost structures. Providers are able to deliver a detailed breakdown of costs that may include fees associated with late deliveries, weekend deliveries and demurrage fees. When enterprise customers are proactively made aware of this information, they can make changes to improve scheduling and capacity plans.
‚Ä¢ Supporting faster procurement cycles: When a procurement cycle can be graded against a predictive target without human intervention, the overall procurement process becomes much smarter‚Äîand faster. Rather than issuing requests for logistics services one at a time, these cycles can be automated and executed in parallel, effectively enabling enterprise customers to lock in scarce capacity for the right market basket of logistics lanes at once.

One main reason why Amazon is so successful in the middle mile is that it has visibility into all of the cost components that make up port and warehouse operations. Such tight visibility undoubtedly played a role in helping it be first-to-market with Same-Day and 2-Day delivery. Amazon is also deriving savings on middle-mile costs that can ultimately be passed to end customers, furthering its competitive advantage.

For retailers, distributors and other e-commerce players who may not have this luxury, an approach to the procurement of middle-miles logistics that leverages predictive models can offer leverage to control costs in a fast-moving environment.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up nearly 0.2% Tuesday morning, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added roughly 0.4%.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.501% from 3.546% on Monday. The dollar index ticked down 0.06% to $102.22.

The major U.S. stock averages tumbled on Monday, kicking off a week packed with macro events and major tech earnings. For the session, tech underperformed, as the Nasdaq lost 2% in the index's worst day since December 2022.

Oil traded sharply lower, with WTI Crude, the U.S. benchmark, down more than 1% ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on Wednesday as oil ministers will review levels of output. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC+ is expected to endorse the group's current oil output policy.

The biggest item on the calendar is the FOMC‚Äôs policy meeting, which commences on Tuesday ahead of an anticipated Wednesday decision to hike rates by quarter percentage point, bringing the federal funds to a target range of 4.5 to 4.75%. Yet It's unclear what could come next.

‚Äú[We] expect Powell to be quite hawkish in the press conference,‚Äù Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note. ‚ÄúWe look for him to stress two themes: (i) slowing is not stopping, and (ii) don‚Äôt expect rate cuts in ‚Äô23.‚Äù

It's also a significant week for the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, as it‚Äôs widely expected for officials to raise benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday. Such a move would mark a slowdown from last year‚Äôs aggressive hikes, as inflation cools and unemployment levels remain low.

The busiest week of the fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off, with more than 100 companies representing nearly one-third of the S&P 500's market value reporting results.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares fell nearly 2% Tuesday after the company reported earnings that beat expectations in the fourth quarter, while revenue came in short. The oil giant posted adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $3.40 compared to analyst forecasts of $3.29. Revenue in the quarter was $95.43 billion, lower than expectations of $97.3 billion.

McDonald‚Äôs (MCD) shares declined after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday morning that beat expectations as more customers visited the fast-food chain amid higher menu prices. Revenue for the quarter came in at $5.93 billion compared to $5.75 billion expected, while the company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.59 compared to analysts forecasts of $2.44.

General Motors (GM) shares added 7% Tuesday after the car maker reported a 15% rise in net income in the fourth quarter amid weak consumer spending.

United Parcel Service (UPS) posted a decline in revenue for the fourth quarter as the company delivered fewer items during the holiday season. Revenue for the quarter fell 2.7% to $27.0 billion, missing analyst expectations of $28.09 billion. UPS reported an adjusted profit of $3.62 per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, higher than expectations of $3.59 per share.

Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) posted lower-than-expected quarterly profit, the first time since the start of the pandemic. Caterpillar reported Tuesday adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $3.86 a share, while analysts expected $3.97.

Spotify (SPOT) reported fourth-quarter results that gave investors a mixed outlook ahead, as the company delivered a wider-than-expected loss and a beat on gross margins. Revenue for the fourth quarter missed. Meanwhile, total monthly active users surpassed expectations, coming in at 489 million compared to 478 million expected.

Finally, Pfizer (PFE) shares dipped after the pharma giant reported adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share on $24.29 billion in sales. The company said it expects lower sales in 2023, including a steep fall in sales for its COVID vaccine.

Elsewhere in markets, shares of Carvana (CVNA) surged on Monday by as much as 33% and rose again in early Tuesday trading. According to Bespoke Investments data, Carvana is part of the list of the 35 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 at the moment. These stocks on average are up 18.8% this year.

Meanwhile, things will quickly turn to tech after the bell. Snap (SNAP) is set to provide an early look into what is cooking in the world of online advertising, user growth and consumer spending, following Microsoft (MSFT) signaling a continued slowdown in cloud growth in December.

Meta Platforms (META) is set to report quarterly results Wednesday, while Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG) are gearing up for Thursday.

Overseas, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday that it expects the global economy to slow. In the U.S., economic growth will slow to 1.4% this year as central banks continue to work to tame inflation, the IMF said.

""I think what people need to recognize is that there is going to continue to be tremendous volatility in the markets and there needs to be a catalyst out there to make stocks go up,"" Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of Destination Wealth Management, told CNBC's "" Street Signs Asia "" on Tuesday. But it's not all gloom and doom for investors. ""You have to look past this moment and look out six to nine months. That's why there may be opportunities available in the market right now because the markets are already assuming things are going to be horrible next year. In my view, it's not going to be horrible, there might be a shallow recession, but I don't see something cataclysmic happening,"" he added. Play it safe Yoshikami said there's a ""reasonable chance"" the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year, but a full market recovery will likely take two years, judging from previous bear markets. ""Companies that sell at an attractive price point to consumers during recessions are attractive investment targets ‚Ä¶ Companies with no earnings will continue to be under pressure, particularly those funded by venture capital and private equity that can no longer capture low interest rate loans,"" Yoshikami wrote in notes to CNBC. Against this backdrop, Yoshikami thinks investors should play it safe. ""Boring. That's the key,"" he said. ""The alternative is you pull the money out of the market, you put it in cash till the market comes back. So, this is a way for you to safely still be in the market in more defensive names while still being able to participate in the market if it rises."" Stock picks While many investors shunned tech stocks this year, including the biggest names in the sector, Yoshikami has three Big Tech stocks among his top picks. He likes Apple for its expanding customer base, effective omnichannel sales and exposure to secular tailwinds. E-commerce giant Amazon makes his list too. Yoshikami said Amazon is ""well positioned"" to join Alphabet and Meta as the third major player in digital advertising, while the company is also poised to expand margins as it transitions from low margin to higher margin businesses. The company is also rapidly growing its Prime memberships, which it could monetize in the future, he added. Yoshikami also likes Alphabet for its digital advertising platform and ""dominant"" global market position in search. He also likes Johnson & Johnson for its ""attractive"" dividend payout. He added that the company is a ""healthcare bellwether"" with a diversified revenue stream and global presence, as well as an ""emerging growth story"" on the back of its ""blockbuster-potential drugs."" Costco is another stock that Yoshikami likes, given the company's ""solid track record as a well operated and efficient"" retailer. The company also enjoys a ""high level"" of customer loyalty and has opportunities to expand internationally, according to Yoshikami. Rounding off his list is Airbus . ""I think you're going to continue to see a significant spike in travel. There obviously was a lag in orders during the pandemic. I think you are going to see a snapback in orders, not only with Airbus, but also with Boeing ,"" Yoshikami said. Buying shares in Airbus will allow investors to participate in airline upgrade cycles ‚Äî a growth area in Yoshikami's view. He favors Airbus over Boeing given the former's net cash financial position. Boeing has a net debt position. ""Given the high operating leverage these businesses face, the stronger financial position of Airbus is a key advantage,"" Yoshikami said.",Asset manager names 6 big-cap stocks as safe havens in volatile ...,non-causal,"CEO, CNBC","['PG', 'TIGI']",['TIGI'],"['CEO', 'CNBC']","['PG', 'CNBC', 'CEO', 'TIGI']",-0.11311176

Earnings Outlook for 2023, and Featured Reports for Apple, J&J and Others

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today‚Äôs Research Daily features an update on the evolving earnings picture for 2023 and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Johnson & Johnson and CSX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today‚Äôs research reports here >>>

Multiple forces are at play in driving stock prices at any point in time. But the two biggest forces in the long run are interest rates and corporate earnings, with our focus in this note solely on the earnings part.

Aggregate bottom-up earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +2.2% in 2023 on +2.1% higher revenues. This would follow the +4.7% earnings growth in 2022 on +10.6% higher revenues.

Estimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, after peaking in mid-April 2022. In the aggregate, S&P 500 earnings estimates have declined by -9.4% since mid-April for the index as a whole and -11.8% excluding the Energy sector.

Estimates have been cut for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Construction (Negative revision of -29.6% since mid-April), Consumer Discretionary (-21.5%), Retail (-21.2%), Tech (-19.6%), Industrials (-13.8%), Aerospace (-13.7%), and Transportation (-10.2%). Estimates for Energy, Utilities, Autos and Basic Materials have modestly increased.

The future course of revisions will depend on how the underlying economic outlook unfolds in response to the Fed tightening cycle.

I am of the opinion that a relatively benign outcome for the U.S. economy where it is able to dodge a nasty recession will be consistent with an earnings outlook that is roughly in-line with current earnings estimates.

I am not suggesting that estimates do not need to come down further. But rather than aggregate estimates outside of the Energy sector already down by almost -12% since mid-April, there may not be a whole lot of further room to fall as long as the economic outlook doesn't materially deteriorate.

Shares of Apple have declined -27.9% over the past year against the Zacks Tech sector's decline of -37.3% and the S&P 500 index's -20.9% pullback. The Zacks analyst believes that Apple‚Äôs holiday season iPhone shipments are expected to suffer from disruptions at its Chinese partner Foxconn‚Äôs factory in Zhengzhou. We expect Apple to ship roughly 70 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

The company expects year-over-year revenue growth to decelerate in the fiscal first quarter compared with the fiscal fourth quarter due to unfavorable forex. Mac revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by forex. Apple expects Mac revenues to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter.

Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable forex, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming. Nevertheless, a growing subscriber base in the Services business and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts.

Shares of Johnson & Johnson have gained +3.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry‚Äôs gain of +12.3%. The Zacks analyst believes that J&J‚Äôs sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products. J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.

However, macroeconomic headwinds like inflationary pressure, rising input costs and negative currency impact are hurting margins. Headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue. Stelara‚Äôs upcoming loss of exclusivity in 2023 is a concern. Though J&J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, they continue to remain an overhang on the stock.

CSX shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past six months (+6.5% vs. +3.5%). The Zacks analyst believes that CSX is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, domestic intermodal shipments and favorable pricing. With the demand scenario expected to remain strong, despite the current market bloodbath, management anticipates double-digit growth in operating income and revenues for 2022 from 2021's reported levels.

However, supply-chain disturbances are hurting CSX's operations. Weakness in the merchandise segment due to lower volumes of fertilizers is concerning. High costs, primarily due to escalating fuel expenses, pose a threat to CSX‚Äôs bottom line. High capital expenditures are also worrisome.

Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include American International Group, Inc. and CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

Ron DeSantis announced on Wednesday new digital rights that the state government will recognize to better protect Floridians against Big Tech surveillance and censorship.

The new ""Digital Bill of Rights"" will enshrine rights for those who use certain online platforms to better ""protect Floridians from Big Tech harm and Big Tech overreaches,"" DeSantis said during a press conference in West Palm Beach.

""We want to protect your right as a Floridian to have private, in-person conversations without Big Tech surveilling you,"" DeSantis said at an event on Wednesday. ""If you want to consent to let them have this information so they can fashion advertising based off of it, it‚Äôs your right to consent to do so but it should only be if you consent.""

""We are also going to protect the right to participate in online platforms without unfair censorship,"" the Republican governor continued. ""We want free speech.""

""We want to protect the right to know how these internet search engines are manipulating search results [and have] transparency in terms of what they‚Äôre doing so you can evaluate if that‚Äôs a search engine that you want to use or maybe you want to take your business elsewhere.""

""We want the right to protect all of your personal on the largest and most common platforms,"" he continued, mentioning Google and Facebook by name. ""They take that data and make a fortune. They should get authorization from you before they are able to monetize that or use it in any way.""

""And, finally, the Digital Bill of Rights aims to protect children from various online harms and, as we that‚Äôs a huge issue,"" DeSantis said, drawing applause from the crowd.

The Sunshine State leader further broke down each point, specifying that Florida's government would no longer allow tech companies to collect information from personal conversations ‚Äî as many devices randomly collect information after being prompted by certain words and phrases.

DESANTIS LAUGHS OFF QUESTION ABOUT HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL PLANS: 'WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW'

DeSantis also explained the difference between the federal government listening in on these devices via wiretap, which legally requires a court warrant to do so, but ""for private companies, if you use their product they can just do it.""

""So, we‚Äôre going to put in a roadblock that says they can‚Äôt do that without your expressed authorization,"" he added.

""We‚Äôre also going to prohibit the unauthorized data collection and retention of real-time information about a user through cell phones such as GPS location, biometric data and other personally identified information,"" the governor said.

DeSantis noted that the new Digital Bill of Rights comes amid a larger push by his administration against Big Tech and the control they have to censor users and control the content they promote, or the content they see on their platforms.

DeSantis reminded the crowd that Florida currently has legislation pending in the courts that would allow consumers to take action against tech companies that unfairly discriminate.

""A couple of years ago, we were the first state to take the lead to protect Floridians against Big Tech censorship and we passed legislation that did a couple of things,"" he said. ""We knew there would be litigation and would have to be decided by the Supreme Court but we decided some provisions of law that said these tech platforms and these social media companies are not ‚Äî by their own admission ‚Äî publishers.""

DESANTIS TIED WITH TRUMP, EVERYONE ELSE FAR BEHIND IN FRESH 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY POLL

The Florida governor said companies like Facebook and Twitter claim to be public forums but operate heavy-handedly to censor certain political views or accounts of conservative figures.

""They are not publishers, because if they were publishers, they would not get Section 230 liability from lawsuits so they hide under Section 230, saying they are not publishers, saying they are open forums, and yet, as we know with what has come out without a shadow of a doubt they are not functioning truly as open platforms,"" he continued.

""They have terms and conditions and they have certain rules, but those rules are applied with a thumb on the scale against the people they disagree with politically. So you have seen people who have conservative views marginalized entirely, banned, de-platformed, shadowbanned and all these different things,"" the Republican said.

WHY THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE IS OFF TO A SLOW START

He added: ""So, what we have said is in the state of Florida we have consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws. If you are advertising as being an open platform, you are taking that liability that says you are not a publisher, you‚Äôre monetizing by taking people‚Äôs data who join your services and then if you turn around and de-platform someone based on viewpoint, you‚Äôre committing a fraud on the consumer. So, we wanted the Floridians who have been affected to be able to bring consumer fraud actions against Big Tech. We also empowered the attorney general of Florida to be able to police Big Tech if they were doing this. We also have protections for political candidates so they could not de-platform a political candidate.""

This legislation is pending in the courts and is awaiting consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court.

""If you‚Äôre an open platform, you can set whatever rules you want, but if you‚Äôre setting rules and not enforcing them equally, based on viewpoint, you are committing fraud on the public and there should be a way for people to hold you accountable.""

Thousands of third-party sellers who ship products themselves will start paying a 2% fee on each sale in October, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. That‚Äôs on top of the commission ‚Äî usually 15% ‚Äî that merchants already pay Amazon to sell products on the popular web store.

Several merchants interviewed by Bloomberg interpreted the new fee as an attempt to pressure them into using Amazon‚Äôs logistics services rather than fulfilling orders themselves. The company didn‚Äôt explain to sellers why the levy was required, but told Bloomberg it will help cover the costs of running a separate infrastructure and measuring its effectiveness.

Amazon has been accused of having too much power over the some 2 million merchants who use its platform, which captures about 37.6% of all online spending in the US, according to Insider Intelligence, or about six times more than its closest online competitor Walmart Inc. The Federal Trade Commission is in the final stages of preparing an antitrust case against Amazon, and the timing of the new fee took some merchants and consultants by surprise.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting here waiting for the FTC to take action against Amazon for antitrust issues, and this fee shows Amazon is not scared at all,‚Äù said Jason Boyce, whose Avenue7Media helps about 100 businesses sell products online.

In recent years, Amazon has been ratcheting up fees on merchants, who typically pay for advertising and logistics to help maximize their sales. The business has become increasingly important to the company as sales growth in the core online operation slows. Seller services generated $32.3 billion in the second quarter, up 18% from the same period a year earlier and more than the profitable cloud services business. Last year, for the first time, seller fees began gobbling up about half the cost of each sale, making it harder for merchants to make a profit.

The new fee targets merchants who use Seller Fulfilled Prime, a service that lets them handle logistics themselves and still get an Amazon Prime badge, which lets customers know they can expect quick delivery. These merchants often sell bulkier items such as furniture that don‚Äôt mesh well with Amazon‚Äôs highly automated warehouses, which are designed to mostly handle smaller products.

Amazon launched Seller Fulfilled Prime in 2015 as a way to expand inventory without overloading its fulfillment centers. It closed enrollment in the program a few years later saying merchants were having difficulty meeting Amazon‚Äôs delivery standards. Amazon in June announced it would again open enrollment for Seller Fulfilled Prime, a move the company saw as a way to appease regulators investigating it for antitrust issues, according to people familiar with the matter.

Amazon informed merchants about the new fee last week.

One office furniture merchant enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime said the fee will cost his company approximately $1 million a year, forcing it to raise prices. He will probably continue to use the service because Amazon has so many customers but notes that he‚Äôs not getting anything extra in return for paying the fee.

Another merchant also expected to raise prices to cover the new fee and said that, for many merchants using the service, the 2% levy will wipe out as much as one-third of already meager profit margins. He also said Amazon only gave sellers a few weeks notice, making it difficult to adjust because inventory had already been ordered for the busy holiday shopping season.

Both sellers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon.

‚ÄúWe are excited to offer Seller Fulfilled Prime to sellers as a way to independently handle fulfillment of their products while also making those products available to Prime customers with fast, free delivery, great customer service and free returns,‚Äù Amazon spokesperson Jonathon Hillson said.

Amazon‚Äôs seller fees have been a focus of regulators and lawmakers since at least 2019, when a merchant accused Amazon of using its dominance in e-commerce to force sellers to use its logistics services. The allegation, since echoed by multiple sellers, has emerged as a focus of the FTC‚Äôs antitrust case against Amazon, according to people familiar with the situation.

Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive officer of Marketplace Pulse, which monitors online sales, says Amazon has been making it harder and harder in recent years for merchants to qualify for Seller Fulfilled Prime. The upshot: ‚ÄúMost sellers use Fulfillment By Amazon instead.‚Äù",University Starts Probe Into Author of Superconductor Claim,non-causal,"FTC, US",['UK'],['THE'],"['FTC', 'US']","['K', 'FTC', 'THE', 'UK', 'US']",-0.9998073

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth remarked in a Wednesday interview with Nikkei Asia that the company would soon respond to the release of ChatGPT, a mass-market AI system that can draft emails or write code in a matter of seconds, with innovations of their own. Google and Meta are the vanguards of AI research with respect to the number of studies published.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been investing in artificial intelligence for over a decade, and have one of the leading research institutes in the world,‚Äù Bosworth told the outlet. He added that Meta employs ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of AI researchers and is confident they are ‚Äúat the very forefront‚Äù of AI innovation.

Meta expects to commercialize elements of its generative AI capabilities by the end of this year. Companies that advertise on Instagram and Facebook, both owned by Meta, could soon ask an AI system to develop images for their campaigns and thereby save ‚Äúa lot of time and money.‚Äù

The technology will also be used to develop portions of the Metaverse, a virtual reality that Meta is currently building, which inspired the company to change its name from Facebook. ‚ÄúPreviously, if I wanted to create a 3D world, I needed to learn a lot of computer graphics and programming,‚Äù Bosworth said. ‚ÄúIn the future, you might be able to just describe the world you want to create and have the large language model generate that world for you. And so it makes things like content creation much more accessible to more people.‚Äù

The development of AI capabilities at Meta comes at a tumultuous moment for the social media firm. Zuckerberg dismissed 27,000 employees in recent months as the company seeks to cut costs and improve profitability. Even amid the economic uncertainty which partially inspired the layoffs, investors have encouraged Zuckerberg to continue funding AI innovation.

Technology companies otherwise battered by economic volatility have similarly rushed to incorporate AI solutions into their products. Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into ChatGPT creator OpenAI, announced last month that the system would be integrated into search engine Bing and internet browser Edge, allowing users to locate information or understand websites more easily. Google revealed one day earlier that Bard, an experimental conversational AI service, would soon be added to the company‚Äôs search engine, which has dominated the sector for two decades.

The breakneck rollout of mass-market AI prompted some technology leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, to endorse an open letter calling for a six-month moratorium on AI development as lawmakers and society at large consider the impact of AI on employment and information channels. Bosworth disagreed with the sentiment of the letter.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs very important to invest in responsible development, and we do that kind of investment all the time,‚Äù Bosworth continued. ‚ÄúHowever, it‚Äôs very hard to stop progress and make the right decisions on what changes you would make. Very often you have to understand how technology evolves before you can know how to protect and make it safe.

While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. For example, the DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) share price is up a whopping 410% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. It's also good to see the share price up 12% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.

The past week has proven to be lucrative for DexCom investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.

See our latest analysis for DexCom

To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During the last half decade, DexCom became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the DexCom share price is up 26% in the last three years. In the same period, EPS is up 23% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 168.39, the market remains optimistic.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

We know that DexCom has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.

We're pleased to report that DexCom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 87% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 38%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. If you would like to research DexCom in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.

But investors shouldn't sleep on this megacap technology winner hitting highs not seen in over a year on the back of a major AI-focused event. Alphabet shares hit a 52-week high Tuesday after showcasing its AI and machine learning capabilities at its annual Cloud Next event. Shares closed up 2.7%. The search giant's benefited from excitement around AI, with shares up more than 53% year to date. Early on, Alphabet proved itself as a dominant name in the AI war , facing off against Microsoft with a competing chatbot, although some fears mounted that it lagged the competition . GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet shares since the start of 2023 ""We continue to believe investors are not giving GOOGL credit for significant public cloud growth or market share gains over the coming years,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. ""The extent to which AI capabilities can drive upward [Google Cloud Platform] revisions in coming quarters is likely to be positive for the multiple of GOOGL."" Wall Street regarded Alphabet's AI hardware advancements as some of the biggest takeaways from the event, reiterating optimism in the company's long-term potential. Along with an expanded partnership with Nvidia for graphics processing units, Alphabet unveiled a new iteration of its tensor processing units to train AI models, and unveiled updates to its own large language models and developer capabilities. ""These advances in infrastructure speak to significant productivity gains to come and opportunities for developers to build more sophisticated AI products through GCP,"" and showcase the company's attempts to quickly scale up capabilities and improve the user experience, he said. Nowak isn't alone. Bank of America's Justin Post said the search company was ""flexing its AI muscle,"" adding that its AI capabilities are a major customer selling point and should be a positive driver for the stock. Along with the hardware updates, Alphabet revealed pricing for a suite of AI-powered tools for enterprise customers. At $30 a month, Citi's Ronald Josey called the contribution ""material over time,"" and said the event should mitigate any ""remaining overhangs"" on Google's Cloud AI capabilities. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson calculates that a strong AI product cycle could enable Alphabet's cloud segment to sustain year-over-year growth within the mid-20% range through 2025. Cloud scaling remains a ""key swing factor"" in medium-term revenue and EPS revisions, he added.

U.S. stock indexes fell on Monday as the collapse of Silicon Valley bank fanned fears of a contagion with trading halted in several banks, while expectations rose for a pause in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in March.

The sudden shutdown of SVB Financial on Friday after a failed capital raise triggered concerns about risks to other banks from the Federal Reserve's sharpest rate hike cycle since the early 1980s.

Regulators over the weekend stepped in to restore investor confidence in the banking system, saying Silicon Valley Bank depositors will have access to their funds on Monday.

""When a step (is taken) this big, this quickly, your first thought is crisis averted. But your second thought is, how big was that crisis, how big were the risks that this step had to be taken?"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.

""The only positive for the markets I've heard come out of this is the belief that it will slow the rise of rates as the Fed seeks to avoid any bigger damage in the financial sector.""

President Joe Biden said that the administration's swift actions to help depositors in two U.S. banks should give Americans confidence that the banking system is safe.

Trading in shares of SVB's peer Signature Bank, which was shut down by regulators on Sunday, was halted.

First Republic Bank dropped 65.1% as news of fresh financing failed to reassure investors, while Western Alliance Bancorp, PacWest Bancorp and Charles Schwab fell 75.9%, 41.0% and 19%, respectively. Trading in the stocks was halted several times due to volatility.

Charles Schwab fell 19% on trade resumption after the financial services company reported a 28% decline in average margin balances in February from a year earlier.

Shares of big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America fell between 2.8% and 6.3%.

The KBW regional banking index fell 11.2%, while the S&P 500 banks index dropped 7.7%.

The benchmark S&P 500 erased all its year-to-date gains as SVB's collapse hit investor sentiment already weakened by worries that the Fed could go for a big hike at its meeting next week.

Traders currently see a 50% chance of no rate hike at the Fed's meeting next week, with rate cuts priced in for the second half of the year.

The projections of a terminal rate have receded to 4.65% by March from around 5.5% in September earlier.

Goldman Sachs analysts said they no longer expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22.

Investors await crucial inflation data due on Tuesday for more clues on the Fed's monetary tightening plans.

The S&P 500 fell 0.8% Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about half as much, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.4%. Central banks in Europe and Asia increased rates a day after the Federal Reserve made another big rate hike and signaled more were on the way. The goal is to cool down economies by making it more expensive to borrow money. The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tends to follow expectations for Fed action, rose significantly.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

Stocks fell on Wall Street in afternoon trading on Thursday and added to weekly losses for major indexes as central banks around the world hiked interest rates to fight inflation.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4% as of 3:53 p.m. Eastern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from an early slide to add 16 points, or 0.1%, to 30,200 and the Nasdaq fell 0.9%. Every major index is solidly on track for weekly losses.

The losses were broad and led by retailers, banks and industrial companies. Starbucks fell 3.9%, American Express dropped 3% and UPS slid 2.9%.

Health care stocks were among the few bright spots. Johnson & Johnson rose 2.2%.

Smaller company stocks fell more than the broader market in a sign that investors were worried about the economy. The Russell 2000 fell 1.9%.

Bond yields rose. The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tends to follow expectations for Federal Reserve action, rose significantly to 4.11% from 4.02% late Wednesday. It is trading at its highest level since 2007. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, jumped to 3.69% from 3.51% from late Wednesday.

Investors are worried that the Fed could get even more aggressive on interest rates, but if prices stabilize that won't need to happen, said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel. It could take more than a year for that process to play out, he said.

""The question is, what's the patience level for both the Fed and the market,"" he said.

Central banks in Europe and Asia raised interests a day after the Federal Reserve made another big rate hike and signaled that more were on the way.

Britain's central bank raised its key interest rate by another half-percentage point. Switzerland's central bank raised its benchmark lending rate by its biggest margin to date, 0.75 percentage points, and said it couldn't rule out more hikes. Central banks in Norway and the Philippines also raised interest rates.

The Fed and other central banks are raising interest rates in to make borrowing more expensive. The goal is to slow economic growth enough to tame inflation, but not so much that economies slip into a recession. Wall Street is worried that the Fed may be pumping the brakes too hard on an already slowing economy, which makes steering into a recession more likely.

On Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell stressed his resolve to lift rates high enough to drive inflation back toward the central bank's 2% goal. Powell said the Fed has just started to get to that level with this most recent increase. The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3% to 3.25%. That is the fifth rate hike this year and up from zero at the start of the year.

The Fed also released a forecast known as a ""dot plot"" that showed it expects its benchmark rate to be 4.4% by year's end, a full point higher than envisioned in June.

Companies are closing in on the end of the third quarter and preparing for the next big round of earnings reports, though some early reports have trickled out.

Heading into today, shares of the world's largest airline had lost 16.28% over the past month, lagging the Transportation sector's loss of 5.69% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.24% in that time.

Investors will be hoping for strength from American Airlines as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.03, up 101.29% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.26 billion, up 37.76% from the year-ago period.

Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.47 per share and revenue of $53.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +394% and +9.66%, respectively, from last year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for American Airlines. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The agency accuses the company of abusing ‚Äúmonopoly power‚Äù at the disadvantage of websites and advertisers who use other advertising tools, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday (PDF). A press conference is scheduled for 2PM ET to announce the lawsuit.

‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google‚Äôs few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,‚Äù the lawsuit reads.

It goes on to allege that Google‚Äôs various acquisitions allowed it to ‚Äúneutralize or eliminate‚Äù competitors. According to the government‚Äôs lawyers, when you add up the alleged anti-competitive moves, ‚Äúthese interrelated and interdependent actions have had a cumulative and synergistic effect that has harmed competition and the competitive process.‚Äù

Google knew this was coming. Last year, the company attempted to avoid a potential lawsuit from the DOJ by offering to separate its ad auctions business, which sells and puts ads on customers‚Äô websites, from Google‚Äôs digital advertising arm. But instead of making it a separate company altogether, the move would‚Äôve put the division under the umbrella of Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet.

That and the other concessions Google reportedly offered obviously weren‚Äôt enough to convince the DOJ that it‚Äôs not engaging in anti-competitive practices. The DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit asks the court to force Google to divest its advertising businesses. Eight states, including New York, California, Connecticut, and Virginia, also signed on to the suit. Google didn‚Äôt immediately respond to The Verge‚Äôs request for comment.

The DOJ sued Google for similar reasons in 2020, accusing it of illegal monopolization of the search and ad markets. At the time, the agency asked the court to ‚Äúbreak Google‚Äôs grip on search distribution so that competition and innovation can take hold.‚Äù Earlier this month, Google filed a motion to dismiss a complaint from the agency that alleges Google leverages its Android operating system and general grasp on the search market to further limit competition in the industry.

The DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit comes as part of a wider governmental crackdown on the grasp of Big Tech. In May of last year, a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats introduced the Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act. The bill could force companies and Google and Meta to divest their advertising businesses, as it would bar companies processing over $20 billion per year in digital ad transactions from partaking in multiple parts of the digital ad industry.",Google is being sued by the US government and eight states over online advertising,non-causal,"ET, PDF, US, DOJ",['I'],[],"['DOJ', 'ET', 'PDF', 'US']","['PDF', 'AMZN', 'DOJ', 'ET', 'I', 'US']",0.95202965
1,good,True,positive,28468,"‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Since then, Nike's direct business has doubled, while its wholesale business has been flat.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Last quarter, Nike's wholesale business at stores like Foot Locker grew faster than direct sales. 

The blip could be related to Nike's ballooning inventory and need to clear out stockrooms, but it also comes as analysts have questioned whether the sportswear giant steered too hard away from wholesale, and Nike executives started talking up the importance of stores like Foot Locker. 

Nike's direct business has more than doubled since June 2017 when it announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a business plan focused on direct sales, both through Nike stores and the company's website and shopping apps. Nike kept doing business with giants like Foot Locker and Dick's, but in some cases, reduced product allocations.","Last quarter, Nike's wholesale business at stores like Foot Locker and Dick's, grew faster than direct sales.",NKE,Consumer Goods,"Apparel, Accessories & Footwear",NIKE Inc B,2023-04-18T15:38:46+00:00,2023-04-18,2023-04-18T15:38:46+00:00,[{'name': 'Politics'}],"The federal government could end up defaulting on its debt ‚Äúsooner than anticipated,"" according to new projections, if capital gains revenue collected by the Internal Revenue Service continues to come in weaker than expected.

Authors from Goldman Sachs Economic Research wrote in a new note Tuesday that ‚Äúweak tax collections so far in April suggest an increased probability that the debt limit deadline will be reached in the first half of June.‚Äù Their conclusion is based on weaker receipts through April 14 with full data expected in the coming weeks.

Similarly, analysts at Wrightson ICAP who track the issue closely are not ruling out the possibility of a June default. They note in an update this week that if tax data remains soft, ‚Äúa June X-date might start to look like a significant risk without becoming our base case.‚Äù

Debt ceiling observers have been closely monitoring tax season for clues about how the ongoing debt ceiling crisis could play out in the coming weeks and months. Without a deal in Congress, the government is set to be unable to pay its bills in the coming months, which could have cascading effects that would almost surely rattle markets and, many fear, tip the economy into a recession.

At issue is if the IRS ends up collecting more than projected, it would marginally improve the U.S. government's books and delay the so-called X-date ‚Äî when the government is unable to pay its bills and is forced to default ‚Äî by a few weeks or months.

Experts are expecting much more clarity by early May, and the Goldman authors noted that there remains a strong chance that the government stays afloat until later in the summer. Still, either way, uncertainty is increasing and they say the the odds are increasing that Congress will need to reach a deal within weeks

Tuesday‚Äôs note from Goldman is a significant update from its estimate in February that targeted early to mid-August as the most likely deadline.

The Wrightson ICAP said it currently forecasts ‚Äúthe Treasury‚Äôs remaining fiscal resources...would run below $100 billion from June 6 to June 13.‚Äù

The sense is that, if the Treasury Department can stay afloat through June, additional tax receipts that are due in mid-June would give the government a bit more breathing room and delay a default until later in the summer ‚Äî unless the tax revenue comes in weaker than expected in the coming days.

What observers are watching is the remainder of the April tax receipts ‚Äî especially in capital gains. Goldman projects that a decline of 35% to 40% ""would be consistent with an early June deadline"" and added that their data so far shows receipts down 39% from last year.

Other analysts at other places that track the issue like the Congressional Budget Office and the Bipartisan Policy Center likely will release their own estimates in the coming weeks as the full picture from tax season becomes clearer.

Experts have long been focused on June as the first significant debt ceiling deadline. Earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen projected that ""it is unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June."" She has not updated her projections in the months since.

The U.S. formally hit the debt limit on Jan. 19 with Yellen and her aides beginning a process known as ""extraordinary measures"" in response. Those accounting maneuvers essentially allow the government to move money around in the vast U.S. Treasury to stave off an actual default, but for only a limited time.

Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., talks stalled. On Monday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) traveled to the New York Stock Exchange Monday to warn Wall Street of the growing chance lawmakers ‚Äúwill bumble into the first default in our nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù

Republicans are blaming the White House for the stalemate, while Biden officials have shot back that Congress needs to pass a simple increase in the debt ceiling and McCarthy is making demands that even Republicans can't agree on.

Spare some time to check the fund‚Äôs top 5 holdings to have a clue about their top bets for 2022.

In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 2015, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a Mountain View, California-based multinational technology conglomerate holding company with a $1.1 trillion market capitalization. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a 3.44% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -32.34%. The stock closed at $91.78 per share on January 17, 2023.

Here is what Wedgewood Partners has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

""Alphabet detracted (like most of our technology holdings) during the quarter and during the year. Alphabet grew its core search revenues high single digits (foreign exchange adjusted) on a staggering +71% year ago comparison. Despite this stellar top-line performance, shares continued to sell off as the market discounted fears of an advertising recession. Per our strategy‚Äôs discipline, our multiyear time horizon allows us to tolerate this exact kind of shortterm volatility in growth rates. The past few years of heightened economic volatility has been unprecedented, so a ""normalization"" of end-market demand at Alphabet is not the end of the world. Alphabet's Cloud segment is generating revenue at a $25 billion run rate but is still running at a loss. This business is capable of generating much better margins in the future. In the meantime, the Company has a fortress balance sheet and has been repurchasing shares at attractive historical multiples.""

Our calculations show that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was in 156 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 153 funds in the previous quarter. Alphabet Inc.

Trump remains the frontrunner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination‚Äîregularly leading all other candidates by double-digit margins in early polls, despite his recent spate of criminal indictments. Candidates like Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have typically drawn only single-digit support in the same polls.

In the wake of Trump's recent federal indictment for the mishandling of classified national defense documents, Ramaswamy was one of the few candidates to outright decry the case as a Democratic plot to jail Trump and hurt his political fortunes. The businessman has pledged to pardon Trump if elected and called for others in the 2024 field to make the same pledge as well.

During a Sunday appearance on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream confronted Ramaswamy on his ""aggressive,"" full-throated defense of Trump and criticism of the legitimacy of the U.S. justice system, citing a New York Times article raising concerns that his rhetoric might cause ""lasting damage.""

""Do you acknowledge that possibility? Are you worried about it?"" Bream asked the GOP presidential contender.

""I'm more worried, Shannon, about the opposite possibility, which is when the Department of Justice weaponized police force against people based on their political viewpoints,"" Ramaswamy said. ""That already undermines trust in the justice system.""

Ramaswamy has regularly received negligible polling support, lower than other longshot candidates that have yet to enter the race, sometimes so low that he is not mentioned in the rundown of candidates. The current Real Clear Politics average of polls shows the GOP contender with about 2.4 percent support among Republican voters‚Äîwell behind Trump's nearly 53 percent and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' approximately 20 percent.

Some observers have said candidates like Ramaswamy are angling for roles in a hypothetical second Trump administration by avoiding overt criticisms of him on the campaign trail, and offering support of him in his various legal battles. For his part, the conservative businessman says that he aims to win the GOP nomination, saying he was inspired by Trump's political outsider campaign in 2016.

The federal indictment issued against Trump last week, which Ramaswamy dismissed as purely political in nature, leveled dozens of charges against the former president, including 31 counts of willfully retaining documents containing sensitive national security information in violation of the Espionage Act. It also lays out extensive evidence highlighting Trump's alleged attempts to obstruct attempts by the federal government to retrieve the documents he had in his possession.

Trump maintains his innocence, repeatedly dismissing the charges as politically motivated. He entered a ""not guilty"" plea during his arraignment in Florida last Tuesday.

A few GOP presidential candidates, including Christie and former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, have been openly critical of Trump's conduct in the wake of the federal indictment, with the latter calling for him to drop out of the race. Mike Pence, Trump's former vice president, also said that he could not defend the conduct described in the indictment if it is accurate.

Tusk said that he and Wolfson realized during the pandemic that there was no prize for the best book about New York City. They decided that ‚Äúif we create an incentive for writers to focus on New York City, that matters,‚Äù Tusk said. The 12-person jury included the filmmaker Ric Burns, who directed the PBS series ‚ÄúNew York: A Documentary Film,‚Äù and Dennis Walcott, the former New York City schools chancellor who is now the chief executive of the Queens Public Library, as well as Tusk and Wolfson. ‚ÄúStories from the Tenants Downstairs‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sewing Girl‚Äôs Tale‚Äù were chosen from among 11 finalists. ‚ÄúThe thing that Sidik did was he managed to write in the voices of so many people, and they were all so distinctive,‚Äù Tusk said. ‚ÄúI have a novel coming out in the fall, and the worst thing about my novel is all the characters sound the same.

If you‚Äôve been wondering about a burst of television commercials and newspaper advertisements ‚Äî and even a billboard in Times Square that reads ‚ÄúIf Black Lives Matter, Shouldn‚Äôt You Protect Mine?‚Äù ‚Äî what‚Äôs behind them is a pricey lobbying war over Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs proposal to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes in New York. On one side is Big Tobacco. On the other are public health groups and a national antismoking organization. Caught in the middle are Black smokers, who smoke menthol cigarettes at higher rates than white smokers. My colleague Luis Ferr√©-Sadurn√≠ writes that tobacco companies have long marketed menthol brands to Black smokers, who die of heart attacks, strokes and other tobacco-related causes at higher rates than white smokers do. The Food and Drug Administration says that menthol cigarettes are easier to become addicted to and harder to give up than plain tobacco. Altria and R.J. Reynolds, which make the top-selling menthol brands, have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbyists who have argued to members of Hochul‚Äôs staff and dozens of lawmakers in Albany that a ban would be ineffective public policy. The two companies have also channeled at least $135,000 to a convenience-store trade group that is fighting the ban.

Their opponents have spent more than $1 million on advertising and on trying to persuade legislators to support Hochul‚Äôs proposal. Well-intentioned though the proposed ban may be, it has angered some Black leaders, including a group of ministers who have rallied against it. They fear that it could increase encounters between Black people and the police if menthol cigarettes went underground and the authorities cracked down on sellers. Other Black opponents of a ban say it would be a heavy-handed attack on the preferred nicotine of Black smokers. Hochul‚Äôs proposal calls for outlawing all forms of flavored tobacco ‚Äî not just menthol cigarettes, but also flavored cigars and cigarillos, as well as flavored smokeless tobacco. Ms. Hochul wants the ban, and a $1-per-pack tax increase on all cigarettes, included in the state budget, which she continues to negotiate behind closed doors with her fellow Democrats who control the State Legislature. ‚ÄúThis is a public health matter,‚Äù the governor said last month, adding that the ban was meant to prevent a new generation from going down ‚Äúthe path of a lifetime of smoking addiction.‚Äù The 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 85 percent of middle- and high-school students who smoke favor flavored e-cigarettes.",Writers Are Rewarded for Their Books About New York,non-causal,PBS,['AG'],[],['PBS'],"['NKE', 'PBS', 'AG']",-0.99988157

In many instances, the home-rolled solutions have most or all of the benefits of Ring‚Äîbut without being owned and controlled by one of the largest and creepiest megacorporations on the planet.



While it requires a little extra work, third-party cameras, NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices, or dedicated NVRs (Network Video Recorders) can be combined to build Big Tech home surveillance alternatives that can scale depending on the budget. 



Many NAS devices make it fairly easy to duplicate app-based home monitoring. Both Synology and QNAP provide dedicated software solutions, both identically dubbed ‚ÄúSurveillance Station,‚Äù which allow you to monitor multiple streaming cameras in a browser across mobile and desktop devices.



Over at Reddit, many users have been taking things a step further, implementing NVRs with embedded AI technologies that can help mimic many of Amazon‚Äôs human detection features without indirectly supporting all of the pesky privacy, labor, and anti-competitive market abuses Amazon is increasingly known for.

One user bought eight Reolink RLC-811A Ethernet-powered cameras and tethered them to Frigate NVR, a self-hosted, open source AI-driven NVR with Home Assistant support. All processing is performed locally on a user‚Äôs own hardware, meaning that camera feeds and footage never leave a user‚Äôs own home, giving them stricter control over their own data privacy.



Much like Google Nest and Amazon Ring products, the software allows users to carefully tailor motion alerts and set up motion detection zones. In some instances, users claim they‚Äôve been able to build home surveillance and monitoring systems with fewer false detection positives than Amazon Ring.

‚ÄúI went from around 10 false positive notifications a day with eight Ring cameras to around maybe 2 to 3, and my cameras constantly record‚Ä¶specific events like cars, dogs, bicycles, etc.,‚Äù Reddit user BloominFosters posted to the self-hosted alternatives subreddit. ‚ÄúPeople detected go straight to my phone through Home Assistant, which is proxied through cloudflare for remote access.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously, get rid of Ring if you can,‚Äù they added. ‚ÄúIt's a privacy nightmare.‚Äù



The retail giant has recently started provided law enforcement with real-time access to home surveillance footage while at the same time carefully cultivating a fear of crime among suburban households. Ring products have been further promoted by a new Amazon-owned TV series intended to normalize the company‚Äôs dystopian vision of home security, which activists say poses a particular danger to already marginalized communities.

While installing and configuring hardware and software may require significantly more technical proficiency than out of the box Google or Amazon options, there‚Äôs no limit of helpful community support in subreddits like r/selfhosted or r/homesecurity. Most popular ad hoc components also feature tutorials on how to mix and match your own hardware and software options, and third-party installation is also an option for those that can afford it.

It‚Äôs been just over a week since Disney‚Äôs board of directors shocked Hollywood and global markets with news that Iger would replace Bob Chapek as chief executive. Iger‚Äôs first town hall before in-person and virtual employees saw him touch on several hot topics: a planned hiring freeze implemented by Chapek following Disney‚Äôs recent lackluster quarterly earnings report, the profitability of Disney‚Äôs streaming portfolio, and the corporate giant‚Äôs stance on LGBTQ+ inclusion.

The latter was an achilles heel for Chapek in his roughly two-year run as CEO. After floating the message that Disney should not be involved in politics, employees and content creators led a full-on social media rebellion decrying his silence on issues like Florida‚Äôs incendiary policies on trans children and classroom policies in acknowledging queer people.

When asked on Monday during an employee Q&A on where the studio would now fall on the matter, Iger said ‚Äúone of the core values of our storytelling is inclusion, and acceptance and tolerance.

Rising inventories and price-cutting could represent only a short-term pause in EV market growth. But they could be signals that boosting U.S. EV sales above the current 7% market share level will be more costly and difficult than expected, even with federal and state subsidies.

Automakers North America have billions of dollars in EV-related investments riding on how the next several quarters play out. If production of EVs continues to outpace demand, automakers will have to choose between slashing prices and profit margins, or slowing assembly lines.

More than 90 new EV models are expected to hit the U.S. market through 2026, according to AutoForecast Solutions. Many will struggle to reach profitable sales volumes, analysts said.

Dealers for established automakers such as General Motors (GM.N) , Ford (F.N) , Hyundai (005380.KS) and Toyota (7203.T) have more than 90 days' worth of unsold EVs at their stores at current sales rates, according to a report from Cox Automotive.

U.S. dealers have more than 92,000 EVs in stock, more than three times the number on their lots a year ago, according to Cox data. Overall, new vehicle inventories are up 74% from a year ago, Cox said.

There is a wide range in the availability of EV models. GM had 50 days' worth of Cadillac Lyriqs available as of June 30, below the industry average of 52 days' supply at current sales rates, Cox said.

GM said in a statement that it has ""very low inventory - and high demand"" for its EVs. More than 80% of Lyriqs and GMC Hummer EVs built are still in transit to dealers, the automaker said.

GM's bigger challenge has been accelerating production and delivery of its next-generation EVs built on GM's Ultium architecture. Of 36,024 EVs GM delivered in the United States during the first half of this year, only 2,365 were Ultium EVs. GM has a goal of building a total of 100,000 electric vehicles in North America during the second half of this year.

Ford had 86 days worth of F-150 Lightnings and 113 days' worth of Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs on hand, Cox said. A Ford spokesman said Cox's figures overstate the inventory available at dealerships.

Ford built 46,238 Mach-Es during the first half of this year, and sold 14,040 of the electric SUVs, according to data posted on its investor site. Ford cut prices for Mach-E models in May.

Volkswagen dealers had 131 days' worth of ID.4 electric SUVs in inventory, according to Cox data.

In a statement, Volkswagen's U.S. sales arm said ""we have seen some softening in EV sales in the U.S. recently"" as supply chain bottlenecks have eased, allowing for increased production.

VW sees strong demand for the ID.4, but does not have enough all-wheel-drive versions of the SUV, ""which is what the market wants,"" the company said. VW also cited ""the effects of some customer confusion and, therefore, hesitation to buy vehicles over the tax credit eligibility of EV models.""

The U.S.-built ID.4 qualifies for a $7,500 consumer tax credit.

Industry officials and analysts cautioned that the U.S. EV market is still in a formative phase, with many consumers still evaluating whether EVs fit their needs and major automakers still ramping up production.

""There's a natural speed of market growth here that many are fighting against, and there's a lot of confusion in the market with too many brands,"" said Vitaly Golomb, an investment banker who focuses on electric vehicles. ""The strong will survive here and the rest will struggle.""

Tesla is using its lead in EV production costs to accelerate demand with price cuts. Legacy automakers are losing money on most of their electric models.

Tesla (TSLA.O) , Rivian (RIVN.O) and other new EV companies do not have dealers or report inventory. Tesla last week reported better-than-expected global deliveries. But the Texas-based EV company has been offering a variety of discounts and incentive offers to spur demand, such as discounts tied to customer referrals launched late last week.

Tesla's price cuts, and competitors' responses, pushed average selling prices for EVs for the second quarter to $53,438, Cox said. That is down 19.5% from the peak of $66,390 in June 2022.

Automakers face tough competitive choices, as well as regulatory pressure from Washington, as they try to accelerate EV sales to levels that will support new North American EV production capacity, such as Ford's sprawling Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee.

The Biden administration has proposed emissions rules that effectively require U.S. automakers to shift their sales to two-thirds EVs by 2032 - a proposal GM and the association representing most automakers in the United States have said is unrealistic.

""Price cuts do show that we're in sort of an equilibrium of demand and supply and price so when sales aren't there, they're going to be dropping price,"" said Mark Wakefield, co-head of consultancy AlixPartners' automotive practice. ""Tesla in particular has the room to do that.""

Wakefield said it is too soon to declare that U.S. EV demand has hit a plateau. ""We see it as choppy growth, but continued growth,"" he said.",US EV market struggles with price cuts and rising inventories,non-causal,"RIVN, KS, VW, SUV, EV, GM, TSLA, ID, GMC","['E', 'PPG']",[],"['GM', 'SUV', 'ID', 'VW', 'TSLA', 'GMC', 'EV', 'KS', 'RIVN']","['GM', 'LYV', 'SUV', 'VW', 'TSLA', 'E', 'GMC', 'EV', 'PPG', 'KS', 'ID', 'RIVN']",0.99965984

Those declines in prices reflect concerns about a global economic recession more than corporate profits, though energy companies have come under fire for returning more value to shareholders than investing in production. 

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t believe I have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families,‚Äö√Ñ√π the president said from his official Twitter account in October.

Why it matters: Companies have been rushing to incorporate generative AI like ChatGPT into their products in what is essentially a massive beta test of an unfinished technology.

What's happening: The large language models that power ChatGPT and similar AI programs were trained on vast swaths of internet content ‚Äî bringing along with it a whole host of biases, stereotypes and misinformation.
‚Ä¢ To limit those problems and block other unwanted content, such as violence and child exploitation, companies like Microsoft, Google and OpenAI have tried to train their AI engines to observe ""guardrails.""
‚Ä¢ But this technology's output isn't always predictable ‚Äî it runs on probabilities more than rules.
‚Ä¢ Some users set out to figure out how to prompt the chatbots to deliberately break the guidelines companies devised. Others just stumble on edge cases by accident.

Driving the news: Snapchat said Tuesday it is tweaking the My AI chatbot it made available six weeks ago.
‚Ä¢ Specifically, Snapchat is working to identify the most harmful abuses and to potentially restrict access for some accounts, as well as to tailor the service to ensure younger users receive age-appropriate responses.
‚Ä¢ ""Being able to review these early interactions with My AI has helped us identify which guardrails are working well and which need to be made stronger,"" Snapchat said in a blog post.
‚Ä¢ Overall, the company says the bot is returning undesired content only 0.01% of the time ‚Äî things like references to violence, sexually explicit terms, illicit drug use, child sexual abuse, bullying, hate speech, derogatory or biased statements, racism, misogyny or marginalizing underrepresented groups.

Microsoft and Google also made changes after high-profile incidents in which chatbots professed love, spread misinformation and returned stereotypical and biased information.
‚Ä¢ Microsoft, for example, has restricted the length of interactions in Bing Chat to prevent customers from defeating its safeguards.

Many companies are finding that the chatbots most often break through guardrails when pushed to do so by users.
‚Ä¢ ""The most common non-conforming My AI responses included My AI repeating inappropriate words in response to Snapchatters‚Äô questions,"" Snapchat said.

Between the lines: People have different reasons for trying to short-circuit chatbot controls.
‚Ä¢ Some want to push the limits just to see what they can make the systems do. Others see a potential for profit. Still others see an opportunity to use the systems to sow doubt and generate misinformation.
‚Ä¢ Some conservatives, meanwhile, view efforts to limit hate speech, racism and homophobia as a sign of political bias.
‚Ä¢ Whatever the reasons, it's abundantly clear that users will do their best to knock down whatever guardrails companies erect ‚Äî and companies need to build systems strong enough to handle anything a user might type.

The big picture: Generative AI is the talk of the tech industry, with new tools, including image generators and chatbots, from Microsoft, Google, Adobe and others capturing the public imagination.
‚Ä¢ Last week Elon Musk and others issued an open letter calling for a six-month pause on the development of advanced large language model-based tools. Other AI critics have called that idea unworkable, urging the government to accelerate efforts to regulate the technology.

Stocks sold off on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average yet again ‚Äî a trend that encapsulates the biggest challenge of the investing year.

The Nasdaq is down 35% so far in 2022, while the Dow is off less than 10%. And this Dow outperformance relative to the tech index is by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble peaked and unwound from 2000 to 2002.

The explanation is relatively simple: The Fed is aggressively fighting inflation, which has clobbered tech and growth stocks this year. Meanwhile, energy names soared for most of 2022, while cyclical and defensive sectors like health care, industrials, materials, staples saw investor interest pick up in the fourth quarter.

For many investors, 2022 may simply seem to be an aberration, a pit stop on the Fed's track back to low interest rates, or what many investors now imagine is the norm after a decade of record low rates.

The thinking goes that once the Fed nips inflation in the bud, the central bank can restart the low interest rate incubator that launched hundreds of high-growth tech winners over the last decade-plus as cheap capital fueled land grabs for market share in new industries.

Markets are pricing in a Fed that finally cools on its rate hiking plans in 2023 ‚Äî but that doesn't necessarily mean a return to the previous trading regime. With geopolitical risk on the rise ‚Äî and COVID worries back in the headlines ‚Äî the battle over inflation could turn out to be a multi-year affair, bleeding into the second half of this decade.

If that's the case, cyclical and defensive names may be the place to camp out for a few years.

And if the trends in the market both in 2022 and the year's final quarter are anything to go by, it seems some investors are catching on to this way of thinking.

Compare the year-to-date performance of the top 25 S&P 500 components by market cap to their respective quarter-to-date performance.

Dark red dominates the year to date returns ‚Äî especially among the large cap names like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL).

Amazon (AMZN) has lost just over half its value this year, while Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META) have seen their market value cut by two-thirds, pushing them outside the top 10 biggest stocks in the index after having crossed the $1 trillion mark last year.

All of those prior names ‚Äî save for Microsoft ‚Äî are sporting deep red returns for the quarter as well, which highlights the difficulty in relying on past winners this cycle.

And the outperformers are instructive, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) up 13% for the quarter. Despite its outsized holding in Apple stock, Berkshire hasn't been held back from gains this year thanks to its profitable financial, industrial, and energy holdings.

Health care, financials, energy, and consumer staples companies are all well-represented among the winners in the fourth quarter. Top performers include JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Proctor & Gamble (PG) ‚Äî all up 20% or more.

Fast forward a year, and the leadership board will undoubtedly look quite different. But a return to the status quo of the 2010s is probably off the table.

The challenge for many investors operating in today's market is that sustained outperformance by value and cyclical stocks over growth stocks hasn't been seen in a generation.

Most investors simply have no memory of the last time this dynamic took hold, and therefore, no reference point for a time when tech wasn't the stock market's pre-eminent sector.

This leaves the table set for another year ‚Äî or perhaps several ‚Äî which looks decidedly unlike anything we've seen in decades.

What We Don't Know

It's still very unclear how Fed officials will react to the banking sector's struggles; however, Fed Chair Jerome Powell may be forced to respond to the turmoil at the conclusion of the central bank's next policy meeting, on March 22. Testifying before lawmakers this week, the chair reiterated that hikes slow the economy down ""with long and variable lags"" that hit some sectors and companies more than others, adding: ""It will take time‚Ä¶ for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized.""

Two of the biggest questions for economists are when the Fed will slow or stop its rate increases‚Äìand what, if not significantly lower inflation, could force the ultimate pause. A growing number of experts believe it could take a large financial market disruption, but it's unclear just what kind As yields on the 30-year Treasury leaped late last year, Bank of America credit strategist Yuri Seliger told clients policymakers could be getting more concerned about poor liquidity in the Treasury market. Additionally, a potentially large drop in housing prices could potentially result in too much tightening in the housing sector, a key part of the U.S. economy.

Labor Day this year comes at an unusually tense point in relations between U.S. vehicle assemblers and

, Ford and Chrysler-owner. The current four-year contract negotiated by the UAW union on behalf of factory employees at the Detroit Three expires on Sept. 14.

The two sides seem far from agreeing on a new contract. Ford on Thursday published the terms of its offer, including a 9% wage increase over the four years. The UAW is asking for a 46% increase. Its plain-speaking president, Shaun Fain, responded in a Facebook address to members that Ford‚Äôs wage proposal ‚Äúinsults our very worth.‚Äù

And Ford is the most union-friendly of the Detroit Three. Although it trails GM in terms of U.S. market share, it assembles more vehicles locally. Its reputation for having a softer touch extends to Canada, where the Unifor union last week picked Ford as its potential target for pattern bargaining, ahead of the expiration of its own contract with the Detroit Three on Sept. 18.

While Fain didn‚Äôt like Ford‚Äôs offer, he accused GM and Stellantis of ‚Äúrefusal to bargain in good faith‚Äù and said the UAW had filed a legal complaint against them. Stellantis called the action frivolous and GM said it was ‚Äúan insult to the bargaining committees.‚Äù

Even allowing for the theatrics of an all-but-public negotiation, none of this bodes well so close to the deadline. If no agreement comes, Fain has said the union will call a strike, potentially at all three companies. A recent vote authorized it to do so with 97% of members voting in favor.

With good reasons to dig in on both sides, it was always going to be a tough negotiation.

For workers, the recent spike in inflation eroded real pay even as higher vehicle prices padded the bottom lines of manufacturers. The existing contract is also riddled with concessions, such as a lower-pay employment tier, that date from Detroit‚Äôs dog years at the start of the century. After a decade of healthy profits, the union wants to nix them.

Meanwhile, manufacturers are focused on the gap between their labor costs and those of nonunionized competitors, which any settlement will only widen. The total cost of the average UAW-organized assembly-line worker is $66 an hour, compared with $55 for nonunionized manufacturers such as

, which now accounts for the majority of U.S. car sales, and just $45 for electric-vehicle specialist

Detroit profits may also be on a downward trend. The analyst consensus is for GM‚Äôs net profit to fall 4% this year and a further 9% in 2024, according to FactSet, as vehicle prices normalize and it sells more low-margin electric vehicles. A generous pay deal would add to the pain.

With so much at stake, a strike seems increasingly likely even if it would benefit nobody. An analysis by consultants at Anderson Economic Group put the cost to the U.S. economy of a 10-day strike affecting all three manufacturers at $5.6 billion. Four years ago the strike at GM dragged out for six weeks.

If a strike does happen, one consequence that Americans could feel far from Michigan is a continuation of the vehicle shortages that emptied dealer lots in 2021 and 2022. Inventories have improved this year, but they are still much lower today than they were when GM workers went on strike in 2019. The RAM and Jeep brands are exceptions, so a strike targeting Stellantis specifically‚Äîa possibility given the company‚Äôs fatter margins and heavier use of temporary workers‚Äîmight not have much market impact. But a broad strike certainly would.

Of course, tighter supply could also have the perverse effect of propping up vehicle margins at today‚Äôs unusually high levels, at least for Detroit specialties such as pickup trucks and large sport-utility vehicles that face less nonunionized competition.

Prescription medicines, in particular, could become tougher to source with drug manufacturers warning that shortages will get worse this year. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people to worry ‚Äì we are preparing, absolutely we are preparing,‚Äù says Hannbeck. ‚ÄúBut really ministers need to get everyone around the table, and soon.‚Äù Pharmaceutical chiefs have been piling pressure on the Government to engage with them for weeks, warning that rising NHS levies on the drug industry threaten to crush the sector and imperil supplies. The wrangling centres around a looming spike in a levy on businesses that supply the NHS. Pharmaceutical companies are facing a bill of ¬£3.3bn as part of a NHS pricing agreement, up from the ¬£563m in 2021. With the NHS now facing record backlogs for treatments, triggering yet more demand for drugs, the levy is likely to remain high for years to come. Drug manufacturers say it is the ‚Äúlast straw‚Äù after soaring energy and ingredient costs over the past few years.

The dispute threatens to undo the progress made by Britain‚Äôs life sciences and pharmaceuticals industry during Covid ‚Äì and put Chancellor Jeremy Hunt‚Äôs dreams of building Britain into a science superpower out of reach. Under the NHS‚Äôs Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing and Access (VPAS), pharmaceutical companies agree to help subsidise the cost of the health service‚Äôs drugs bill if it rises by more than 2pc. The rate of how much companies are charged ultimately depends on how big the NHS‚Äôs medicines‚Äô bill is and how fast it rises. During the pandemic, costs ballooned. Industry leaders feel they are now being unfairly singled out to foot the bill. AstraZeneca chief Sir Pascal Soriot this week groused that pharmaceutical companies ‚Äúdidn't sign up to cover the cost of Covid.‚Äù US drug makers AbbVie and Eli Lilly, have already quit the scheme in protest. The move is seen as a negotiating tactic ahead of talks with ministers about the future rate of the voluntary scheme. Even companies that quit must pay: leaving the voluntary scheme puts companies under a statutory scheme that usually requires them to pay back a higher proportion of sales. The repercussions of a sharp spike in these levies are prompting some less well known manufacturers to pull out of supplying Britain altogether. This is particularly the case for companies manufacturing so-called ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù drugs ‚Äì medicines no longer protected by patents and so made and sold for far less. Generic medicines account for four out of every five prescription medicines used by the NHS and four in every 10 of them fall under the VPAS scheme. ‚ÄúThese companies run on very thin margins, so when the costs increase, including VPAS, it does make some products loss making,‚Äù says the British Generic Manufacturers Association‚Äôs chief executive Mark Samuels. ‚ÄúAt that point, companies will really look at whether that can supply the NHS, because no business can sustain supply of products at a loss for very long.‚Äù A shrinking supplier pool would ultimately lead to higher prices for the NHS as supply is constrained. The London School of Economics estimates that companies pulling out and competition drying up could cost the health service ¬£7.8bn. A shrinking market also threatens a doom loop whereby constricted supply pushes up prices, in turn spiking the VPAS levy, which prompts more suppliers to quit, triggering a reinforcing cycle. Generics drug makers are not the only ones pulling back from Britain because of the levy. New York-listed Bristol Myers Squibb has said that it could divert investment away from the UK. ‚ÄúThe reality is that from a commercial perspective, the environment is not actually supporting continued investment in the UK,‚Äù chief executive Giovanni Caforio told the Financial Times. AstraZeneca last week announced it had snubbed Macclesfield for a ¬£320m drug manufacturing plant, instead basing the factory in Ireland. Sir Pascal blamed government policies for disincentivising investment.

Across Europe, the industry is constructing four ‚Äúbiological plants‚Äù, 14 ‚Äúactive pharmaceutical ingredient‚Äù sites, four ‚ÄúValue Added Medicines‚Äù sites and 17 ‚Äúfinished dosage form‚Äù factories. None of these are in the UK. It is not just in manufacturing where Britain is losing pace but also in research. Figures from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry suggest that the number of clinical trials initiated in the UK slumped by around 41pc between 2017 and 2021. GSK chief Dame Emma Walmsley said earlier this month the company was concerned about this decline, saying ‚Äúgetting it right‚Äù would attract more investment. Dame Emma has said Britain is at a life sciences ‚Äútipping point‚Äù. Covid vaccine developer Professor Sir Andrew Pollard told the Telegraph last week the situation is ‚Äúperilous‚Äù. Industry leaders are due to meet with Health Minister Will Quince later this month and the Department of Health is understood to be open to looking at the operation of the NHS‚Äôs VPAS scheme. A spokesman said the scheme has ‚Äúdriven significant improvements in patients accessing clinically and cost-effective medicines, whilst protecting NHS finances and promoting innovation‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe NHS has delivered a record number of access agreements since VPAS was agreed, including many world and European-first agreements. We will continue to engage with industry to understand the impact on companies.‚Äù Ultimately, many in the drug business think Britain will simply have to pay more for its medicine. The UK spends 81p on prescribed medicines for every ¬£100 in GDP it generates, compared to ¬£1.94 in Germany and ¬£1.84 in Japan. Of its total health budget, around 9pc is spent on medicines, compared to 14pc for Australia, 15pc for France and 17pc for Germany. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, this is about getting medicines to patients,‚Äù says one Big Pharma executive. ‚ÄúAnd if we can‚Äôt do that, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù",NHS backlogs put Britain‚Äôs medicine supplies at risk,causal,"US, UK, GDP, NHS, GSK, VPAS","['NHS', 'UK', 'A']",[],"['GDP', 'VPAS', 'NHS', 'UK', 'GSK', 'US']","['GDP', 'VPAS', 'A', 'BMY', 'NHS', 'UK', 'GSK', 'US']",0.98124

One of the perceived advantages to fintech firms, at least to investors, is that they are not subject to the same capital requirements as banks, and therefore can be founded with much lower investment levels.

The owners and managers of fintech firms are also subject to far less scrutiny. Anyone with access to funding may be a founder of a fintech firm, but the regulatory authorities ensure that bank operators are held to a much higher standard.

Part of the reason for the rise of the fintech economy was rooted in regulatory arbitrage. Simply put, banks and fintech firms have not been competing on a level playing field. Banks are heavily regulated by the government and must comply with strict rules and guidelines including capital requirements, lending standards, and consumer protections. The banks are also saddled with considerable burdens for compliance for which the fintech firms have thus far mostly avoided, and the penalties for technical failures are disproportionately larger for banking firms.

For example, consider what happened to USAA and Capital One . In March 2022, USAA Federal Savings Bank was assessed a $140 million civil money penalty by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for failure to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, and in August 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) assessed an $80 million civil money penaltyagainst Capital One related to a data breach.

Banks are required to have everything in place and working correctly at all times. New developments must be fully tested and completely integrated into the bank prior to introduction to customers, and things that go wrong are viewed very negatively.

Banking-as-a-Service (‚ÄúBaaS‚Äù), somewhat similar to the concept of ‚ÄúOpen Banking‚Äù, is one of the primary ways banks interact with the fintech and crypto-fintech community, and it is a target for regulatory pushback. BaaS is not dead, but the activity will need to be re-shaped as the regulators apply pressure to banks to take responsibility for their fintech customers.

Simply put, BaaS is the technologically enabled provision of banking products to non-bank third parties. These fintechs are customers of the bank who then directly acquire customers themselves, and those fintech customers most likely are not even aware that they are consuming products from the underlying bank.

The multiple U.S. banking regulators are increasing the scrutiny of the overall risk profile of banks, and that has led to considerably more attention to third-party relationships. Banks are under pressure to ensure that they fully understand the risk characteristics of firms that receive services from the bank.

In a BaaS relationship, the fintech is essentially interacting with the customer on behalf of the bank, and that means all the activities of the bank and the fintech must be compliant with the relevant regulations. Expect heightened attention to Know-Your-Customer rules, Bank Secrecy Act provisions (anti-money laundering), marketing and advertising standards, and all aspects of credit.

Banks can outsource certain activities, but they can never outsource the responsibility. This means that banks are responsible for the ensuring their BaaS fintech customers are in compliance with the rules to the same extent that would be done if the bank were conducting the activity themselves.

There are a number of banks in the U.S. participating in the BaaS space. Expect them to demand more from their fintech partnerships. The cost model for the fintech companies will need to be reevaluated in light of the increasing compliance costs, and they will need to be far more transparent to their banking providers.

Regulatory enforcement has already started. In 2022, Blue Ridge Bank NA entered into a formal agreementwith the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Blue Ridge Bank agreed to increase the regulator‚Äôs oversight of the BaaS activities. Within the OCC order the bank agreed to obtain the OCC‚Äôs non-objection before entering into any new contracts with fintech partners or adding new products in cooperation with existing partners.

Perhaps for reasons related to cost and compliance of maintaining the banking relationship, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that Signature Bank will no longer process Swift transactions of less than $100,000 for crypto exchange customers.

The fintech players have been free-riding on the banking industry. Up until now the U.S. financial technology industry has been able to rely upon banks to do the heavy lifting and absorb the costs of compliance and regulation. Perhaps that time is finally coming to an end.

The regulators are reminding banks that they are responsible for the activities of their fintech partners, and that will lead to change. No doubt there will be a change in the model that subtracts from the profitability of the fintech model. Perhaps banks will stop supporting the growth of their fintech competition and we can see banks once again safely and soundly leading the financial services customer experience.

‚Ä¢ But companies are not using it correctly and consumers don't understand how it's being used ‚Äî or that they should be compensated.
‚Ä¢ Companies must give people the power to control their own data if they are to be successful.

Companies that succeed in harnessing the power of data will be the leaders of the next decade and will help enrich the lives of billions of people. But they will do so by allowing people to own and control their own data.

Asia Pacific is the perfect region to talk about the future, as experts and analysts believe we are currently living through the ""Asian Century."" In Southeast Asia, smartphone use is booming and there is a public commitment to digital infrastructure, commonalities found in countries across Asia.

The digital economy has also created a shared regional community. For example, you can travel from Singapore to Thailand, buy a cup of coffee with your digital wallet, and have the transaction debited in near real-time from your Singaporean bank account.

But to think big, we must start small. We must begin with the most basic building block of the digital economy ‚Äî data.

Data has been historically misused by businesses, and misunderstood by consumers

Up until now, too many businesses have taken advantage of data. Many companies have assumed it's theirs to do whatever they want with. As consumers we often give away our data for free, without knowing why, what happens with it, or that we've even given it away. We give away something valuable without being compensated.

Data is a waste when it's used mindlessly like this. But a smart, well-governed strategy for data and its usage will empower both people and businesses.

The different types of data are changing the way we interact with the physical and digital worlds

Data can create a vibrant portrait of a person's life, their behavior, and their preferences. As such, it's a powerful thing. In the digital economy, there are broadly three different types of data: data of identity, data of places, and data of experiences.

Firstly, data of identity is the information that represents how we identify ourselves and how organizations verify who we are. Data is used as authentication in a growing number of industries, including finance and healthcare. Government services, like filing taxes or collecting benefits, are also digitizing.

This is already having an impact on our physical world. For example, when you fly into Singapore, your passport is a biometric device linked to your fingerprints, with a photograph linked to your face. That information is picked up by facial-recognition systems at Changi Airport, allowing you to enter the country.

Secondly, data of places can be used to geolocate consumer behavior, collecting information on where you shop, drive, and live. This is powerful and sensitive information.

Finally, the speed and convenience of data of identity and places creates data of experiences, which connects us with a community. For example, after you've landed at Changi Airport, data can instantly find you places to go, groups to join, and things to do in Singapore.

Data is 24/7/365 and the digital economy is always on. This has changed our behavior and expectations, meaning goods and services need to be instant and on-demand.

Where does artificial intelligence come in?

A new stage of AI entered our collective conscience in the first half of 2023. Programs like ChatGPT can generate realistic, human-sounding, written conversations. Generative AI like this can take an input, like a written description, and create a new kind of output.

But when AI goes wrong, drawing incorrect conclusions from its data inputs, it can do real damage. For example, in healthcare in the US, AI has made dangerous recommendations for people of color, such as favoring white patients over Black ones. Currently, most data on the internet relates to white men. People of color, women, and marginalized groups are not well represented. To change this, we must look at the data.

Data is the fuel that powers these AI systems; its quality directly impacts their reliability. So it's important to critically examine potential biases within the data, because AI is most effective when combined with human intelligence and expertise in a system of checks and balances.

Data will be a very powerful tool, but only if companies harness it correctly

Machines are getting better at processing data, but they cannot feel, and they do not have ethics.

When it comes to data, we are currently in a ""phase of collection,"" where NFT tickets can contain data to show the holder gets VIP entry or access. So far these have been confined to digital experiences, but soon they will become part of the physical world.

In the coming years, we will enter a ""phase of consent"" that will increase trust. People will have a say in how their data is used and what they get in return. At the moment, we are often confronted with a long, complicated list of terms and conditions when we give away our data. But soon, we will be able to be more specific about what data we want to give away and for which uses.

Finally, by the close of the decade, we will enter the ""phase of commercialization."" Data will become a way of paying for goods and services, or of receiving rewards and discounts, online and offline.

For example, take a visit to a sporting event. When the player gets the ball, you could see his stats scrolling by in your VR glasses. You could order a snack from your seat. You might go into a fan zone hosted by a hotel in a virtual-reality world, where your avatar could trade digital collectibles, or meet your friends' avatars. Back in the physical stadium, you could buy a team jersey ‚Äî and have a stadium drone deliver it to your seat.

In this world, ethics and safeguards will be essential. At Mastercard, ethics will be expressed in good governance, cutting-edge technology, open finance, collaboration, and in giving consumers and users the tools to control their own data.

These changes need to be embraced in how companies handle data, but creating trust is key. Most importantly, it's not companies that should control data ‚Äî it's consumers.

Companies will need to hold it, protect it, and facilitate the services that others create around it.

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) made headlines for its fall, leaving many bank executives to ponder what exactly happened and what they can do to protect their banks and themselves. Better managing liquidity risk is among the obvious considerations, but what are the long-term strategies?

The advancement of AI and the changes toward open banking add new dimensions and challenges to the market turbulence, systemic risks and many uncertainties. This article will provide key executives, including CEOs, CFOs and CROs, with cost-effective finance transformation strategies to complement digital transformation initiatives in-flight in most North American banks.

We‚Äôll address the immediate concerns and discuss how we can progressively transform the finance, risk and regulatory compliance ecosystem leveraging AI, specifically machine learning and deep learning, and robotic process automation (RPA) to create new business capabilities and enforce governance for the new technologies to mitigate risks and sustain growth.

Finance, risk and regulatory compliance are at the heart of banking areas. Still, many banks deprioritize these factors due to the complexity and scale of transformation, where there are hardly any quick wins or shortcuts. But any mistakes therein will severely impact the bank or lead to the dismissal of the executives managing that division or function.

My company‚Äôs advisory team and subject matter experts work with senior executives and delivery management daily on digital transformation in these selected domains and recommend that the banks must be prepared to root out the deep and hidden causes that surface as various forms of risks. Some of the risks can manifest themselves as short-term profitability but can eventually lead to the bank's demise.

The flip side of seeing the risks clearer is that banks must forecast better, allocate the cost with deep insights, and transfer the fund with speed and precision. This is where AI and RPA on the cloud come in handy to complement and accelerate the outcome-based transformation strategies in domains of finance, risk and regulatory compliance.

To do it right, however, governance and guide rails must be enforced. Banks are experts in banking, after all, not technology. Oftentimes, collaborating with vendors as well as regulators in a particular business or technology domain can be the most sensible approach.

Continuing The Financial Transformation And Building New Business Capability

Most banks have started digital transformation to build data lakes and migrate applications onto cloud platforms. Some banks have also attempted to transform finance and risk‚Äîfor instance, by modernizing legacy systems.

As a part of a sustainable strategy, finance and risk groups must collaborate to create value for business partners as well as technology custodians and to fit into the bank‚Äôs overall priorities and vision. For instance, rather than reinventing the wheels, it is recommended to review the current state and existing programs of fund transfer, reconciliation, and cost allocation, and re-examine the target state of incorporating AI, ML and RPA to build new business capabilities‚Äîbe it new forecasting models, enhanced operational processes, one source of truth for finance, risk and regulatory reporting or cloud-native infrastructure to integrate vendor solutions. The starting point can be building up or migrating existing data lakes to the federated data lake on the cloud.

One of the critical decisions is to select a cloud vendor. Oracle Cloud is one good choice, but Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform or a combination of these and others can all be good choices as well. The key is to build up the virtual meta-bridge to enable federated architecture and progressive operational processes with the help of optimized caching for data, which in turn enables virtualization for consumers for timely business results.

Guardrails And Governance: Applying STAGE And TOTAL Security To Machine Learning

If you need to read more on the banking STAGE framework and TOTAL security, please follow the links. In a nutshell, cloud platforms offer much more robust security controls than on-prem counterparts. However, it is not a one-to-one shift-and-lift process to transform finance, risk and regulatory compliance to cloud-native capabilities. Cybersecurity has its new twists and turns due to the new capacities of ML on cloud platforms.

Safe and sound security infrastructure and governance framework must be in place for data technologies. This includes best-of-breed data lake or data mesh platforms such as data wrangling pipelines and MLOps, along with Spark-curated data vaults by business domains, streaming-enabled data fabrics and AI-augmented transfer learning leveraging edge computing for financial crime prevention biometrics.

From proof of concept to production, my company has worked with finance and risk teams to develop, train, deploy and fine-tune profitability forecasting applications, new models for liquidity risks, virtualized data consumptions patterns for external and regulatory reporting as well as internal and human-in-the-loop analytics, adjustments, reconciliation, audit screening and issue resolution.

More rigorous and challenging is the need to enforce security framework, especially in the case where sensitive data elements are part and parcel of the data wrangling and data enrichment. Synthetic data may be preferred, and cached or in-motion equivalents may be mandated. Where at-rest data are required, encryption and additional security controls must be strictly compliant with internal data governance, privacy and security policies and, more importantly, relevant regulatory requirements.

This article is an executive-level strategic proposal toward digital transformation by embracing AI and RPA on the cloud for finance, risk and regulatory compliance in large banks. Importantly, it only scrapes the surface and glances over some of the most important aspects of security, governance, new capabilities building and cloud-native features‚Äîwhich are the most challenging aspects to people who are living in the banking domains that many outsiders may take for granted.

These technology and business areas are extremely challenging. These are deep waters where sharks are swimming and potent forces emerge to significantly change, if not redefine, banking as we know it today. To start at the heart of banking and the most prominent suite of AI machine learning is not an easy task. It takes courage and talent to drive through the next decades of digital transformation.

Not since the 2008 financial crisis has the global banking system appeared so fragile, as the rapid increase in interest rates used to tackle soaring inflation sends shock waves through the City.

In the turmoil of the past fortnight, the Swiss government-brokered rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has led investors on both sides of the Atlantic to ask the same question: is this 2008 all over again? How bad can it get?

The short answer from banking industry experts is ‚Äúno‚Äù, arguing that problems are limited to a few troubled banks. Major lenders are in a much healthier position than 15 years ago, especially in the UK, after a steady ratcheting up of bank capital and liquidity requirements. This is not the opening scene of the Big Short. SVB is not Northern Rock for the Instagram generation.

The Bank of England reckons the UK system is safe and sound. The biggest lenders have core capital ratios ‚Äì a key measure of financial strength ‚Äì three times higher than before 2008, while annual stress tests suggest banks could weather an economic storm twice as strong as the last big crash.

The longer answer is more worrying. This might not be a carbon copy repeat of the 2008 collapse, but it is not entirely without danger.

Across the City, risk managers are scrambling to look again at the health of the financial firms they do business with. Who might be the next casualty? Are there risks outside of the banks? How will regulators respond?

Given this fear, uncertainty and doubt, bank shares and bonds have sold off sharply, driving up the cost of funding even for supposedly strong and stable lenders. The big worry is that a higher cost of funding for banks will be passed on to households and businesses, should the turbulence lead their risk managers to respond with caution when making new lending decisions.

In other words: a credit crunch is coming.

After the most aggressive tightening cycle for interest rates in decades, higher borrowing costs are beginning to bite hard on the real economy. With an added layer of financial sector instability on top, households and businesses are likely to experience a further increase in the cost of credit.

‚ÄúYou have financial stability issues ‚Äì even if they‚Äôre not really to do with the UK this time. And in general, it will make people more nervous,‚Äù says Alastair Ryan, a banking industry analyst at Bank of America.

‚ÄúIt increases the risk of US recession, and raises the cost of investment through the bond market and through the banks.‚Äù

The situation is most pronounced in the US, where there are concerns over cracks emerging in the $5.6tn (¬£4.6tn) commercial property market. Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, warned last week that banking sector turbulence was ‚Äúlikely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes‚Äù.

A ‚Äúsystemic credit event‚Äù has now replaced inflation as the biggest concern in financial markets, according to Bank of America‚Äôs closely watched monthly survey of fund managers. And with good reason: Goldman Sachs analysts forecast hawkish monetary policy and banking stress could cost the world‚Äôs 10 leading economies about 0.6 percentage points of gross domestic product this year.

In the UK, all of this will badly undermine hopes for a stronger economic future fuelled by a revival in business investment. It‚Äôs a risk the Bank of England is alive to, saying last week it would watch carefully for any spillovers from banking industry stress to household and business borrowing costs.

Britain, after all, enters the looming credit crunch without having ever really recovered from the last. For many, living standards have not advanced much since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Average wages, after taking into account inflation, are no higher today than in 2007.

The UK was a perennial underperformer long before 2008, but has stumbled further behind since ‚Äì exacerbated by the Brexit vote, Covid-19, political infighting and a chop-change approach to policymaking.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve wasted a decade,‚Äù says David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank‚Äôs rate-setting monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crash. He warns that Threadneedle Street will soon be forced to cut rates to avoid a damaging recession.

‚ÄúYou had an opportunity for huge public investment at low rates. Which could‚Äôve had high return, could‚Äôve crowded in private sector investment. But there was none of that. It all falls at the door of the Tories and their failed austerity.‚Äù

The chancellor Jeremy Hunt‚Äôs budget earlier this month included a focus on rebooting business investment, with tax incentives for company spending. At the margin, there were measures that might help. But high borrowing costs and banks taking a tougher approach to lending will push in the opposite direction.

Despite the painful lessons of 2008, Hunt plans to complement his growth plans by rolling back some of the banking sector changes put in place over the past 15 years to prevent another such mess from taking place again. But the ‚ÄúEdinburgh reforms‚Äù could not come at a worse moment.

‚ÄúThere is no real case for financial sector deregulation,‚Äù says Dr Josh Ryan-Collins, an associate professor in economics and finance at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, University College London. He says the priority should be making banks safer, while using the power of the state to direct credit to more productive sectors of the economy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a case of ferocious lobbying by certain interests in the City. And Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak looking for some sort of growth post Brexit. But it‚Äôs not going to work.‚Äù

Instead, an approach to see Britain through the crunch is required.

In a riskier world, the government could increase the use of public sources of capital to encourage a crowding-in of private enterprise, with an industrial strategy to inform the overall direction of travel.

‚Ä¢ Talks between the Detroit 3 and the UAW come amid a backdrop of a strengthening labor movement.
‚Ä¢ Union members on Friday overwhelmingly approved a strike, should leaders call for one.

The United Auto Workers union is gearing up for a fight with Detroit's Big Three car companies this summer and fall ‚Äî and isn't ruling out a possible strike.

The union said Friday that results are still being tallied, but so far 97% have voted in favor of authorizing one or more strikes against Stellantis, General Motors and Ford. Such votes are almost always approved by large margins.

Ford, GM, and Stellantis (the owner of Chrysler and Jeep) returned to the bargaining table in July to hash out a new four-year agreement with the UAW, which is under new leadership following a yearslong federal investigation into financial corruption. Their current contract expires on September 14.

The fate of about 150,000 union-represented workers at the Big Three hangs in the balance as the two sides hash out the future of work in an increasingly electrified industry that will likely see less and less internal-combustion engine production and more battery production.

The talks come amid the backdrop of a newly emboldened labor movement across the country, with several high-profile strikes and organizing pushes in the entertainment, food, and retail industries. UAW President Shawn Fain, who was elected by a narrow margin in March, is leaning into this labor movement, eschewing long-standing traditions like ceremonial handshakes with the automotive CEOs in favor of connecting with his members.

He's taken to Facebook Live in recent months to speak directly to his members, preparing them for a potential strike.

""We have to be able to do whatever we have to do if you want to have these gains. The companies aren't going to freely give it,"" Fain said in June.

President Joe Biden, who has promised to be the ""most pro-union president,"" previously urged the UAW and Detroit car companies to come to a ""fair agreement"" that avoids plant closures and helps usher in a transition to a ""clean energy economy.""

""I want to be clear about where I stand. I'm asking all sides to work together to forge a fair agreement,"" Biden wrote in the White House statement. ""The UAW helped create the American middle class and as we move forward in this transition to new technologies, the UAW deserves a contract that sustains the middle class.""

Fain and the UAW have withheld endorsement for President Biden's re-election campaign over concerns about the administration's actions on electric vehicles. In a statement in May, Fain warned that the EV transition could become a ""race to the bottom"" for American workers, and urged politicians to ""have our backs"" before the union makes any commitments.

Escalating tactics at the UAW predate Fain. In 2019, at the height of the union's corruption scandal, the UAW initiated a 40-day strike at GM's more than 30 US factories. The work stoppage helped the union notch wins on wages and job security, even as the company won the ability to close several factories. In the end, GM lost some $3.6 billion due to the strike.

The union, which also covers workers in other industrial industries and some academic institutions, has also had high-profile work stoppages at John Deere in 2021 and the University of California in 2022. Fain has said he is not ruling out a strike in this round of talks, potentially at more than one company.

This is the first round of negotiations between the Detroit car companies and the UAW in which electric vehicles will be front and center. EVs were an undercurrent in the 2019 negotiations, but since then the segment has grown exponentially and companies like Ford and GM have made firm commitments to build more EVs, which require less labor.

The car companies will be looking for more flexibility to respond to changes in demand for EVs, which is already creating headaches for companies like Ford. The UAW will be looking for assurances that their work will be protected even as it changes, and that wages will continue to improve even as the companies look to remain competitive with EV-makers like Tesla who use cheaper non-union labor.

Then there is the issue of powertrain production. At GM, an Ultium battery plant has taken the place of Lordstown Assembly, which closed after the 40-day strike in 2019. The labor force there joined the UAW in late 2022. GM on August 24 agreed to a 25% average pay increase for the roughly 1,100 workers there, CNBC reported.

Ford is building a new EV campus in Tennessee, which is not unionized. As the industry moves away from historically unionized engine production and toward new battery plants that have not yet been unionized, the topic of job security will be at the forefront of EV talks as the UAW is seeking top union wages at those factories.

Labor costs are small, but the only thing in the company's control

The cost of labor only accounts for roughly 5% of the cost of building a vehicle, but it's the only part of vehicle production costs that companies can exert control over. This small piece of the pie is going to be even more important for companies to control in the next four years as commodity costs become more difficult to predict.

The average labor costs for the Detroit Three heading into contract talks four years ago hovered between $55 and $60 per hour. After the agreements in 2019, the Center for Automotive Research forecasted labor cost increases between 13% and 20%. That average includes wages and benefits.

While it's unlikely that the companies will be able to bring these costs down, they will be looking for ways to keep them from going up too much. However, some estimates based on what the UAW has won outside the automotive industry in the last four years put potential increases in labor costs between 25% and 30% over the next four years.

Negotiations formally began at all three companies last week. The current contracts are set to expire September 14.

In a new interview with NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said that while it remains safe to fly, officials have grown concerned as they have begun ""to see things that we don‚Äôt expect to see.""

‚ÄúWe expect every flight to operate as it should,‚Äù Nolen said. ‚ÄúAnd so we‚Äôve had these events over the past few weeks. That gives us a moment to say let‚Äôs stop. Let‚Äôs reflect. Let‚Äôs ask ourselves the question. Are we missing anything?‚Äù

The full interview airs this evening on NBC‚Äôs Nightly News at 6:30 p.m. ET.

Among the most high-profile of the recent incidents: An American Airlines flight crossed an active taxiway at JFK Airport in New York City as a Delta Airlines flight was about to take off, prompting the FAA to issue subpoenas to the American pilots; a Learjet 60 took off from Boston Logan International Airport without clearance and nearly collided with a landing JetBlue flight; and a FedEx cargo airplane trying to land at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas narrowly avoided hitting a Southwest Airlines flight preparing to take off.

In fact, FAA data show there have been fewer overall near-miss incidents over the past six months than in the same periods prior.

Still, compared with an average of between four and 10 ‚Äúserious runway events‚Äù or near misses a year over the past decade, Nolen said, recent months have produced more incidents ‚Äúthan you‚Äôd expect to see.‚Äù

That also includes an incident that saw a United Airlines flight taking off from Maui unexpectedly plunge to within 800 feet of the Pacific Ocean, causing terror aboard.

""It's a good opportunity for us to just make sure, let‚Äôs go pressure test our assumptions,"" Nolen said of the summit.

Aviation experts have questioned whether one factor leading to the uptick in incidents is the swift rebound in flying in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the numbers remain just short of February 2020 levels, Nolen acknowledged a resurgence in air travel has affected the flying landscape.

""We‚Äôre coming out of the backside of this pandemic,"" he said. ""And... truly we‚Äôre seeing pent up demand for flying. Flying has come back with a vengeance, so to speak.""

That demand for air travel is coming at the same time as the aviation industry grapples with a wave of retirements that occurred as the pandemic bore down. Nolen said that while hiring is occurring ""aggressively"" to refill the positions, the combined weight of increased flying and ongoing hiring has produced ""some pressures in the system.""

Amid record profitability for airlines, Nolen called on carriers to continue to create schedules that ""match their capability and demands of the market.""

""We want to make sure as we look not only today but into into the summer and into the future that we‚Äôve got that happening,"" Nolen said.

Nationwide ground stop in January was the 'right decision'

The FAA is also continuing to address concerns about the temporary nationwide ground stop imposed in January after its Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMS) system went offline.

Nolen said that the stoppage ""was the right move to make in that moment.""

""What the flying public expect is that they‚Äôre safe, and that there‚Äôs a level of predictability there and we want to give them as much as we can,"" he said. ""I couldn‚Äôt guarantee that in that moment there. And so we made the right decision in the interest of safety to take a timeout, make sure the system was safe.""

But he acknowledged that the FAA must ameliorate a system where there can be ""a single point of failure."" He praised Congress for recently pledging to provide funding so that the FAA can continue to upgrade its systems.

""What I‚Äôve heard time and again: 'We‚Äôre prepared to help you, we‚Äôre prepared to give you the the resources that you need,'"" Nolen said of Hill officials. ""And so we‚Äôre very grateful for that. Our mission is to make sure we get it right.""

Despite the recent crop of troubling incidents, Nolen emphasized that flying in the U.S. remains ""very safe,"" noting there has not been a major fatality event since 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407, a subsidiary of Continental Airlines ‚Äî now part of United Airlines ‚Äî went down en route to Buffalo, N.Y., killing all 49 passengers and crew aboard.

""We have the safest most complex Airspace System in the world and it is very safe,"" he said. ""It is very resilient. And with that, we will continue always to never take that safety for granted. We will not become complacent.""

But the recent episodes nevertheless have the attention of safety officials, Nolen said.

""When we see a few events that pop up, we‚Äôre going to take a moment to say 'Hey, is there something we‚Äôre missing here?' Because this is this is an incredible record, and we want to keep it going.""",FAA administrator: We're seeing more near-collisions than expected in U.S. skies,non-causal,"JFK, ET, FAA, NBC","['FAA', 'S', 'U']","['FAA', 'NBC']","['FAA', 'ET', 'JFK', 'NBC']","['AAL', 'U', 'FAA', 'NBC', 'ET', 'S', 'JFK']",-0.68267715

With more than half of U.S. corn and soybean acreage facing drought conditions, some farmers are calculating whether insurance payments will cover the cost of the crops they have sown this year.

As of June 27, 65% of the Midwest was in a moderate drought or worse, the broadest area in a decade, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said 70% of the country‚Äôs corn production area and 63% of soybeans were affected by drought. The five-year average for U.S. corn in drought before this year is 18%, according to federal data, and 15% for soybeans.

In Coal Valley, Ill., where Megan Dwyer‚Äôs family raises corn, soybeans and beef cattle on 700 acres, the fate of the farm‚Äôs year depends on how much rain falls over the next few weeks.

‚ÄúWith the drought, we might not even have a crop to sell this year,‚Äù said Dwyer, a fourth-generation farmer, at The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Global Food Forum event in late June.

Around a third of winter wheat grown in the U.S. is expected to be abandoned, according to federal data, because the poor quality isn‚Äôt worth the cost to harvest it this year. That would represent the highest rate of abandonment since 1917.

Some livestock producers and meat companies are bracing for higher feed bills that could follow a smaller-than-expected harvest.

Farmers whose fields remain green, however, are set to pad their incomes. Farmers outside of drought territory could get another year of solid income just as corn prices were on the decline, said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

‚ÄúMy grandmother always told me to pray for drought in Illinois,‚Äù said Irwin, who comes from a family of Iowa farmers.

Higher prices for crops also improve prospects for global crop shippers such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge as concerns over supplies prompt grain buyers to make advance purchases.

ADM is estimated to earn more than $3.7 billion in profit in its 2023 fiscal year, while Bunge is expected to make $1.8 billion for the year, according to FactSet. ADM and Bunge had no comment.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see weather volatility getting any better,‚Äù said Bunge Chief Financial Officer John Neppl at a May investor conference. ‚ÄúWhen you have a global platform like we do and you have all the origin-destination combinations that we can put together, that really bodes well for a business like ours.‚Äù

Wheat futures were up about 10% in June. Corn and soybean futures, which had traded higher as drought spread, have fallen in recent days as traders responded to wetter forecasts in the Midwest and expanded corn acres detailed in a USDA report.

How the weather ultimately impacts farmers‚Äô harvests this fall could hinge on the next few weeks, analysts and farmers said.

Farmers‚Äô drought math can have mixed implications for companies such as Corteva, Bayer, Deere and CNH Industrial, which sell farmers seeds, pesticides and machinery.

While higher crop prices can mean more money for farmers to invest in their next growing season, analysts said, if the drought decimates too much U.S. farmland and farm income, farm suppliers will suffer as growers transition to cheaper generic seed purchases or put off equipment purchases.

Corteva said its success depends on farmers succeeding, and droughts can impact their productivity. The company is developing more drought-tolerant corn, a spokesman said. Bayer, Deere and CNH had no comment.

Dry conditions bring new pests and diseases that require additional farm chemical purchases. Joe Sinclair, president of the farm retailer Quality Ag Services in Iowa, said insecticides sales will be on the rise this year as the dry weather brings pests like two-spotted spider mites into farmers‚Äô fields.

Higher grain costs from drought make it more expensive to feed cattle, hogs and chickens.

Many hog farmers are struggling to make a profit, and cattle ranchers have been shrinking their herds over the past year as their feed bills go up.

Dairy producers will need to decide whether to shrink their operations or eat the higher feed costs until the market moves back in their favor, said industry officials. Ethanol producers paying higher prices for corn could be faced with the decision of whether to keep their plants running at lower profit margins or to cut production, executives and analysts said.

For farmers with drought-withered fields, crop insurance can help growers come close to break-even and defend against bankruptcy, said Matt Bennett, an Illinois farmer and co-founder of brokerage and consulting firm AgMarket. Net. But farmers will still struggle to cover costs for fertilizer, fuel, seeds and other expenses.

The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday ran a feature about semiconductors, soaring inventories, and weak demand. Investors then sold chip stocks across the board. Easy narratives drive stock prices, regardless of facts.

It‚Äôs a lesson, and an opportunity for investors.

Let‚Äôs be clear, some semiconductor markets are in a glut.

We know this because executives from the companies that are the biggest players in those markets have told us. Sanjay Mehrotra, chief executive at Micron Technology (MU) says that computer memory inventory at the Lehi, Utah-based company is well above internal targets. That‚Äôs code for too much stock, and forced price cuts. In the interim, Micron is also cutting 10% of its workforce to smooth out the short term hit to profitability.

Then there is Intel Corp. (INTC), the world‚Äôs largest maker of central processing units, the brains of most PCs and data center servers. Intel has been a bad business for so long it is hard to remember when executives were on the right side of industry trends. Forbes reports that nothing has changed.

Micron and Intel are big suppliers to the largest personal computer markets. The companies supply Hewlett Packard (HPQ), Dell Technologies (DELL) and the rest of the industry that is not Apple (AAPL). Business has been bad since late 2021 when businesses and consumers stopped upgrading their computers to get online. And there lies the larger problem for investors in chip businesses.

The upgrade cycle coming out of the pandemic was real, yet short-lived.

The lockdown forced companies to upgrade laptops, and enterprise software suites. A lot of those sales were pulled forward, out of the normal capital expenditure cycle. Sales that would have occurred in 2022 became redundant. Add a slowing global economy, due to higher interest rates, layoffs and general worry and you get weaker consumer demand, too. These factors are causing a glut of chips, for PCs, smartphones, and other categories impacted by the pandemic pull forward.

That is a substantial part of the semiconductor business, however, it is not all of the sector. The world is not really awash in chips. There are too many of the chips that have become commoditized over time.

Some parts of the sector, like specialized graphics processing units for cutting edge datacenters, next generation silicon for electric vehicles, power stations and EV charging infrastructure are experiencing high demand. Companies like On Semiconductor (ON) have sold out production years in advance.

And the Journal notes that executives at Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC), a supplier to the defense industry and data centers, are not concerned with rising inventories given the nature of its customers.

Despite this, both On Semiconductor and Lattice were hit hard Tuesday in the fallout from the WSJ semiconductor story. The stocks declined 1.7%, and 3.5% respectively.

And that is the lesson for investors: Big narratives drive stock prices, even when the storyline is fundamentally flawed. Smart investors wait for the fallout, look for support levels, then invest wisely.

There is one other factor for semiconductor investors to keep in mind.

The stock prices typically begin moving higher as executives guide analysts‚Äô expectations about future inventories.

Colette Kress, chief financial offer at Nvidia told analysts in November that inventory levels could normalize by the end of January. Nvidia shares responded by rising from $139 to $187.70 during the next six weeks, a gain of 35%.

Overall, semiconductor sales are projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, according to a research reports from Gartner , and McKinsey. The only weak spot was PCs. Researchers at Gartner expect a modest 5.4% decline for PC sales in 2023.

The bottom line is that the current narrative about the semiconductor glut is an opportunity. Investors should look for attractive entry levels for their favorite businesses in the sector. The sector is not a monolith, and it is not in decline.

Today, Oil Trading Europe Team Leader Alaric Nightingale looks at the rising price of Russian crude. To get this newsletter sent to your inbox, you can sign up here.

Russia is chipping away at the effectiveness of Western sanctions on its petroleum trade.

The nation‚Äôs top export grade rose to $62.92 a barrel at the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk on Friday. That‚Äôs the highest since before the European Union banned imports and joined the Group of Seven in imposing a $60 price cap on Russian supplies in December.

The rally means Urals ‚Äî either at the point of export in the Baltic Sea, or at the point of delivery in India ‚Äî is trading at ever-smaller discounts to international markets.

That‚Äôs a good measure of the impact of the sanctions ‚Äî but it would be wrong to write off the G-7‚Äôs approach entirely.

Moscow still hasn‚Äôt provided any verifiable evidence that the ships hauling its petroleum are properly insured. And because of their age, the tankers serving Russia carry more environmental risk than the rest of the fleet ‚Äî something India and China are well aware of.

They are, on average, 16 years old, with many nearing their scrapping age. It costs around $7.5 million to transport a standard-sized cargo of Russian oil to China from the Baltic Sea, Argus Media data show. That would have been a very high delivery cost at almost any other time in history.

Even so, with Urals now approaching $74 a barrel by the time it reaches India, the grade costs just $6.65 less than Dated Brent, a benchmark for physical oil trades.

That‚Äôs the smallest discount since Argus began assessing a delivered-to-India price in late February. Point-of-export prices are more marked down, but those discounts are also shrinking.

Russia is eking out a more normal petroleum supply chain. Until its fleet is fully out of the shadows, and fully accepted by its client states, that will remain a work in progress.

Plunging margins for petrochemicals are set to take a bite out of Big Oil‚Äôs quarterly profits, adding to the pain from lower crude and natural gas prices. Sluggish demand for consumer goods that use plastics and rubber, combined with a flood of new factories in the US and China, means margins face a potentially protracted downturn. That has cast a cloud over a sector long-touted as the future for oil majors. The companies may be insulated from the worst of it as chemicals remain a relatively small part of their global operations. Yet a structural deterioration in that business adds to headwinds already facing crude, trading and refining markets.

US oil producer Chevron Corp. has already released its quarterly numbers, posting better-than-expected results after Permian Basin output soared to a record. The company also waived the mandatory retirement age for Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth.

Russia attacked one of Ukraine‚Äôs Danube ports, ramping up the risks facing Kyiv‚Äôs last major grain export route and global food trade. A drone strike ruined a hangar at a terminal on the river, Ukraine‚Äôs southern operational military command said. Wheat prices rose more than 5%.

But according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the impacts in the residential housing markets from these events are likely be ""modest"" for potential homebuyers.

‚ÄúTo be clear, tighter lending standards will weigh on the residential mortgage sector,‚Äù chief credit strategist Lotfi Karoui wrote in a note to clients this week.

""But the net impact will likely be more modest than for other segments such as small business and commercial real estate loans.""

Among the factors buttressing the residential market from the crisis' worst impacts is that mortgage lending is less sensitive to bank balance sheet pressures compared to other forms of lending.

Only 18% of mortgages sit whole on bank balance sheets, while nearly 70% of outstanding mortgages are stripped of credit risk and securitized into the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market where these mortgages are held and traded by investors, Goldman noted.

Additionally, roughly two-thirds (64%) of first-lien mortgage origination volume comes from non-banks, according to data from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council cited by Goldman Sachs. Goldman notes lending standards in the residential housing market had already tightened before the recent bank crisis, suggesting broad impacts in credit conditions would likely be more muted in this pocket of the market.

Buyers have also seen something of a reprieve from rates this year, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage sliding to 6.28% from 6.32% the prior week, according to the latest data from Freddie Mac out Thursday. Rates have dropped for four consecutive weeks and are down from nearly 7% in the final weeks of 2022.

But rates still present a challenge for homebuyers who aren't seeing the full benefits of a decline in Treasury yields as investors price in more modest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.

Goldman notes that the gap between the 30 year-fixed mortgage rate and their closest proxy, the 10-year Treasury yield, has widened in recent weeks.

Goldman said there are two main factors driving this spread ‚Äî demand for higher margins from lenders and poor performance in the mortgage-backed securities market.

Silicon Valley Bank, for instance, held about $65 billion in mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet at the end of 2022 and was sitting on unrealized losses of $887 million from these holdings. Data from Goldman shows roughly 97% of outstanding mortgages have interest rates below the current average 30-year rate.

The investment bank expects lenders to remain selective and rates to be volatile in the short-term, resulting in a continued wide gap between mortgage rates and Treasuries.

Meanwhile, the spring selling season has arrived in the U.S. housing market but a resulting surge in demand has not yet been seen.

Mortgage application volume dipped for the week ended March 31, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey. The slide followed four consecutive weeks of gains.

And though affordability measures have improved somewhat, the cost of buying remains prohibitive relative to conditions that prevailed just two years ago, Goldman Sachs data shows.

Going forward, the firm also expects metro-level readings on prices to be more instructive than national indicators.

""[The] metropolitan areas that have seen more resilience through the housing market downturn also have very tight inventory levels, with only a modest improvement over the past year,"" Goldman wrote.

""Additionally, housing affordability has been a key determinant of regional home price variance; even with falling Treasury yields, affordability levels in underperforming markets remain very poor.""

‚Ä¢ A recent survey suggests Republicans are more likely to take a cruise right now than Democrats.

Cruise demand appears to have returned to pre-pandemic levels ‚Äî but not everybody is comfortable booking a vacation at sea quite yet.

If you thought you could avoid politics on vacation, think again. The COVID-19 pandemic may have created a partisan divide between cruise-goers and landlubbers, The Washington Post reported, citing data from the market research firm YouGov.

In a December 2022 survey of 1000 US adults, 35% of Republican respondents said they were ""very comfortable"" going on a cruise today, a level of enthusiasm shared by only 12% of Democrats.

On the flip side, 40% of Democrat respondents said they were ""very uncomfortable"" going on a cruise ship, nearly double that of Republican respondents.

Taking a cruise vacation wasn't always politically polarized ‚Äî 16% of Democrat respondents said they had gone on a cruise prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, just a few percentage points less than Republican respondents. That gap narrows even more when considering the survey's margin of error.

Cruise ships were ground zero for the initial spread of COVID-19, infecting hundreds of passengers and crew members. And it's not just the coronavirus that spreads easily between the close quarters of ships. This February, more than 300 people onboard a week-long Princess Cruise suffered from a gastrointestinal illness that the company says was likely a norovirus outbreak.

The survey's democratic respondents also signaled they were less comfortable with in-person activities ‚Äì like going to a concert, taking public transportation, or flying on an airplane ‚Äî than their Republican counterparts, leading The Washington Post's data experts to conclude that ""covid caution"" is likely the main driver behind the divide.

Any growing Democrat hesitancy toward cruises and their propensity for spreading illness doesn't appear significant enough to dent the industry's recovery. With this month marking three years since the onset of the pandemic, industry executives claim cruise demand has officially returned to 2019 levels.

On an earnings call Monday, Carnival Corporation announced that this quarter's booking volumes were the highest in company history.

The combined strike of actors and writers in Hollywood is entering its second week. It's already seen Tina Fey, Kevin Bacon, David Duchovny, and other stars join performers and creators on the picket lines.

Unions for United Parcel Service (UPS) and Detroit's so-called 'Big Three' automakers are poised to join them in coming weeks if contract negotiations fall through ‚Äî and neither of these scenarios is a long shot.

Bank of America's auto analyst John Murphy has put the odds of an autoworker strike at 'better than 90 percent.' UPS has only 10 days left to cut a deal with the Teamsters union before a July 31 deadline for downing tools.

For many analysts, the US, and other western nations are witnessing a resurgence of long-dormant industrial action, as unionists seize the opportunities of a tight labor market to push bosses for better pay and benefits.

University of California labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein told Bloomberg this was the 'biggest moment of striking since the 1970s' as union chiefs found their nerve and went 'on the offense.'

Some 65,000 actors and 11,500 screenwriters are on strike over pay, healthcare benefits, and protection from artificial intelligence, shuttering TV and movie sets in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago and beyond.

It's not clear when negotiations between their unions, SAG-AFTRA and the Writers' Guild, and the studios and streaming companies, which are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, will resume.

The group says they've already offered writers and actors better pay and perks.

UPS bosses said this week they would return to the bargaining table with a better offer for roughly 340,000 Teamsters-represented US workers.

They're keen to avoid a strike that could cost the company $7 billion in just 10 days, according to one estimate.

It could also upend parcel deliveries to millions of Americans.

Talks broke down on July 5 over disagreements on wages for experienced part-time workers, some of whom make less than new hires because starting wages jumped due to the labor shortage in the last few years.

He said they had the 'power' to decide whether they showed up to work and would win bigger paychecks by 'sticking together.'

In a statement, UPS bosses said they were prepared to raise their 'industry-leading pay and benefits' and talks are set to continue next week.

President Joe Biden met this week with Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers (UAW), which represents 150,000 US hourly workers at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, to discuss a looming strike.

Contracts between the union and the Big Three carmakers are set to expire in September.

Fain has slammed their record profits and efforts to move manufacturing abroad.

Still, action across all three makers at the same time is unlikely, analyst say.

'We just have to see where things go,' Fain said.

For their part, the carmakers say they already offer good wages and perks, and must remain competitive against lower-paying rivals, like Elon Musk's Tesla, as they pump money into next-generation electric vehicles.

In Hollywood, studio bosses have their own cashflow problems thanks to the switch to streaming, which is less lucrative.

Likewise, UPS has struggled with demand as the US emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.

How the negotiations play out could set a precedent for workers, unions, and bosses for the coming years.

If unions triumph, it will send a message to workers at companies like Amazon and Starbucks, which have resisted unionization, that they can unite and put pressure on executives.

It would also mark a turnaround for organized labor, which has seen membership collapse in recent decades.

In the early 1980s, fully one fifth of America's private sector was unionized, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's fallen to barely 6 percent nowadays.

The biggest actions in US history ‚Äî including the Steel Strike of half a million workers in 1959 and the 400,000 railroad shop workers who downed tools in 1922 ‚Äî appeared to be in the rearview mirror.

In their recent book Union Booms and Busts, Judith Stepan-Norris and Jasmine Kerrissey, count 1974 as the peak year for labor actions, with 6,074 separate strikes across the US.

Union leaders were tamed as the courts became more hostile to them in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan.

Strikes started ending with fewer gains for workers, and union membership fell.

That's why many analysts see the 2023 as a turning point for laborers, who are flexing their muscles even as global supply chains and automation should be putting more power in the hands of employers.

'Never forget this: Working people outnumber the billionaires and CEOs by a huge margin,' said Robert Reich, a University of California, Berkeley, professor and Carter-era labor secretary.

The report on Monday shows requirements for receiving a loan have become more difficult for commercial and industrial loans. Families will also face challenges and higher costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit and credit cards.

The loan officers anticipate problems to continue into 2024. The survey cites concerns about diminished expectations for economic growth, changes in lending standards, terms and business and household demand for loans, concerns over deposit outflows and reduced risk tolerance.

The SLOOS is a quarterly survey conducted by the Fed that collects data about bank lending practices and credit conditions to gauge a pulse on the economy. The survey is a leading indicator of how bank credit will likely change and offers insights into the economy‚Äôs future direction, which can inform monetary policy decisions.

‚ÄúThere has been an ongoing tightening of lending conditions. And that is part of the process by which monetary policy works,‚Äù United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC. ‚ÄúThe Fed is aware that tightening of credit conditions is something that will tend to slow the economy somewhat. And I believe they are taking this into account in deciding on appropriate policy,‚Äù Yellen added.

With tighter restrictions on business and personal loans, the economy will contract. As businesses are unable to procure funding, they will likely need to streamline costs, which will include conducting layoffs. These actions align with Powell‚Äôs policy to degrade the economy and labor market to beat inflation. The rationale behind the Fed‚Äôs policy is that if more people lose their jobs, they won‚Äôt spend as much money, and inflation will start easing downward.

What The SLOOS Says

The survey covers commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans. Due to economic conditions, banks are expected to tighten standards across all loan categories and see a deterioration in the credit quality of their loan portfolios and customers' collateral values. There will also be a reduction in risk tolerance and concerns about bank funding costs.

Banks are tightening credit terms and seeing a drop in loan demand. The survey shows that 46% of banks tightened credit terms for a key category of business loans for medium and large businesses compared with 44.8% in the prior survey in January. For small firms, conditions were slightly more stringent, with 46.7% of banks saying credit terms were stiffer now versus 43.8% in the last survey.

What Will Happen Next

In a press conference last Wednesday, Powell announced that the Fed would raise interest rates for the 10th consecutive time to a range of 5% to 5.25%. In his quest to dampen the economy to bring down record-high inflation, there will be collateral damage, including job cuts.

When rates rise, it amounts to an additional tax on households and companies. The extra costs deter spending for both consumers and corporations. As companies feel the effects of higher borrowing costs, they tighten their belts, cut costs and lay off workers. This is an intended consequence of Powell‚Äôs anti-inflation quest.

A tweet thread by Nick Gerli, a management consultant focused on real estate and lending, suggests that a significant slowdown in lending in 2023 could lead to layoffs and bankruptcies.

Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, New York Community Bank and PacWest Bancorp are just some banks that have announced layoffs throughout the 2022 and 2023 economic downturn.

The implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, the acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan and UBS‚Äôs takeover of Credit Suisse will cause significant job losses. Other banks will plan to downsize as well as they try to lower costs. The layoffs are coming at a time when many banks are facing tighter profit margins and a more uncertain economic outlook.

Layoffs in the banking industry will significantly impact already-reeling small and regional banks. The share prices of several financial institutions have plunged as fears spread. PacWest, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation and other small and regional banks have been the focus of hedge fund short selling, with allegations that they are in dire financial straits.","Bank Loan Officer Survey Shows That The Economy Will Slow Down, Leading To Layoffs",causal,"UBS, CNBC",['SLOOS'],[],"['CNBC', 'UBS']","['BAC', 'UBS', 'SLOOS', 'CNBC']",0.9934141

Since 2020, loan defaults have been muted, partly thanks to pandemic-era stimulus cash and other government assistance that kept default rates low. But lenders are now starting to feel the ill-effects of higher interest rates and inflation on borrowers. Which is why US banks are putting aside more money than usual to deal with potentially bad loans.

In general, b anks with more exposure to rising interest rates are poised to fare better, while those reliant on investment banking, trading, and wealth management are being faced with a more challenging environment.

‚ÄúFor example, Wells Fargo boasts the highest net interest margin of the group and is therefore expected to experience the biggest boost from rising rates while also avoiding any drag from other activities due to its focus on traditional banking activities,‚Äù Joshua Warner, a market analyst, wrote for Forex. ‚ÄúJPMorgan and Bank of America will grow slower because they have lower margins and will see their earnings dragged down from their other activities.‚Äù

            Authored by Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist,

Regional banks in the US have been outperforming their larger counterparts this month, but that is likely to soon reverse as their larger exposure to real-estate becomes a hindrance.

Perhaps counter-intuitively it has been the larger US banks that have been hit the hardest after the collapse of SVB and Signature bank.

Reasons cited have included greater exposure to Credit Suisse and expectation of more regulation on the way.

Systematic selling has also not helped as investors jettisoned bank stocks, fearing the crisis could be become systemic.



But there are several reasons to believe that larger banks will soon begin outperforming again.

Deposits at US banks at the aggregate level have fallen since last summer. Yet total bank balance-sheets have barely declined as banks ramped up their loan-to-deposit ratios (LTDRs).

However, digging under the surface, it has been the smaller banks who have done most of the lending.

Their LTDR has risen 11% points since late 2021, versus 7% points for large banks, while their total assets have risen over $300 billion over the same period, while larger banks‚Äô assets have fallen by $400bn.

This extra lending has been in consumer loans, but most of the rise has been in real-estate loans ‚Äì residential and commercial.



This is a potential problem for smaller banks. They remain prone to deposit flight in the wake of SVB, with larger banks already attracting billions of dollars.

SVB was slightly unusual among the smaller banks in that it had a large fixed-income portfolio, its plummeting value the death warrant for the bank. In response, the Fed has unleashed another acronym on the financial world ‚Äì the BTFP (Bank Term Funding Program) ‚Äì where banks can repo in Treasuries and agency securities for up to a year at par.

But the smaller banks have a lot more residential and commercial real-estate on their books relative to the larger banks. 

They therefore have a greater proportion of assets that are not ‚Äúshiftable‚Äù onto the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet - ultimately this is a greater stress on their liquidity.



Deposit rates will soon rise for small and large banks, and this may have more of an impact on larger banks‚Äô profitability to begin with.

But they may not need to raise them as much as they continue to soak up small-bank deposit migration.

Furthermore, large banks are cheaper on a P/E and P/B basis (comparing the BKX index with the KBW regional bank index).

Cloud service providers (CSPs) benefited from a modern gold rush as businesses of every size migrated to an infrastructure that didn't require capital investment. Or even an electric bill. The cloud even became the profit center for Amazon, a multi-billion-dollar business.

Cloud, as a business model, makes for easy accounting. Why buy a server when you can pay as you go? The downside is that workloads must move off-prem to be in the cloud, which has a certain amount of baggage. It also introduces a new tension between the CFO office and that of the CIO, as OpEx dollars are far easier to budget than CapEx. So isn't there a way to bring the public cloud's flexible business and operational models to on-prem computing? That's what the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Antonio Neri, asked his team to figure out.

By 2017, all the traditional server OEMs were losing business to the public cloud, which continues today. Antonio recognized the threat to his core business but also acknowledged the value of consumption-based computing. So he commissioned a new initiative that year, HPE Next, chartered with delivering a plan to compete in the new hybrid-cloud world. That team delivered.

It‚Äôs All About That GreenLake

HPE announced its HPE GreenLake Hybrid Cloud solution at HPE‚Äôs annual Discover conference in mid-2018. Antonio stood on stage in Las Vegas and told the world that HPE GreenLake would enable ‚Äúa new consumption experience‚Äù for IT, bringing the operational and financial flexibility promised by the CSPs together with more traditional on-prem resources.

He told us that hybrid cloud is a reality for nearly every IT shop, and it's time for the traditional OEMs to embrace that reality fully. Moreover, Antonio told us that this is Hewlett Packard Enterprise's new future. He‚Äôd just bet the company on a new business model.

I remember clearly the jaded skepticism in the analyst room after the keynote. Few believed the company could pull off such a shift, one that impacted HPE's culture as much as its products. HPE proved the skeptics wrong.

Antonio didn't just promise HPE's customers a new choice for hybrid cloud; he told HPE's investors this was a high-growth, high-margin path to the future. He was right. GreenLake began paying off almost immediately.

By December 2018, HPE had grown GreenLake to 400 customers. In its most recent earnings call, HPE told us that the total annual recurring revenue for GreenLake reached $1B for the first time. The company isn‚Äôt sitting still, harboring strong projections for future growth.

HPE offered more statistics about GreenLake‚Äôs growth at its 2022 investor conference. HPE has grown from 400 customers in 2018 to more than 65,000 today. GreenLake has over 2 million connected devices and has more than an exabyte of data under management. More than 80% of HPE‚Äôs largest customers are using GreenLake.

Antonio said of GreenLake during the most recent HPE earnings call: ‚ÄúThe relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both ARR and our as-a-service total contract value higher. Over the last 2 years, we have more than doubled our as-a-service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter.‚Äù

Delivering IT-as-a-Service requires more than just servers, storage, and networking. It also requires a robust set of software and services. These are necessary to give IT users a seamless experience in procuring, provisioning, and managing the underlying resources. This is a critical element of the GreenLake offering. HPE tells us that two-thirds of GreenLake‚Äôs revenue is software and services.

HPE has filled the gaps in its GreenLake offerings with an aggressive run of strategic acquisitions. Since announcing GreenLake in 2018, HPE has acquired nearly a dozen companies that directly contribute to GreenLake functionality. These include companies such as QuattroLabs, Scytale, CloudPhysics, Zerto, and Axis. This week HPE added to that list with its acquisition of OpsRamp.

HPE this week announced the acquisition of OpsRamp for an undisclosed amount. OpsRamp was founded in 2014 to simplify the management of hybrid IT infrastructure. The OpsRamp solution leverages an industry-leading AIOps approach to monitor multi-cloud infrastructure and manage business-critical services.

OpsRamp helps IT organizations optimize services through automation and integration with ITSM and DevOps tools. These capabilities span multi-vendor computing, networking, storage, cloud resources, containers, virtual machines, and applications.

HPE tells us that it intends to integrate OpsRamp into GreenLake. HPE will leverage OpsRamp‚Äôs hybrid digital operations management solution with GreenLake to reduce the operational complexity of multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments in the public cloud, colocations, and on-premises.

It's hard to remember how forward-thinking HPE GreenLake was when it was announced. HPE was alone among the tier-one OEMs willing to undertake such a dramatic cultural shift to take control of its future. However, the company remains alone in putting a consumption-based subscription model as the cornerstone of its offerings.

The strong positive reaction to HPE GreenLake forced HPE's competitors to follow suit. For example, Dell Technologies announced its Apex consumption-based offering in 2020, while Lenovo unveiled its comparable TruScale offering in 2021. Beyond compute, NetApp and Pure Storage also offer on-prem consumption-based storage offerings.

HPE GreenLake is the benchmark for on-prem consumption-based infrastructure, a segment that is growing daily. Enterprises love the flexible economic and operational models that consumption-based infrastructure enables.

HPE‚Äôs CEO Antonio Neri bet the company‚Äôs future that enterprises would respond to the strategic shift. Enterprises have responded, and GreenLake is now a billion-dollar business. HPE‚Äôs continuing investments, such as this week‚Äôs acquisition of OpsRamp, demonstrate that the company is determined to evolve its offering to meet the growing demands of its customers at a level beyond its most direct competitors. HPE is well-positioned for continued success with GreenLake.

Price increases have been even more sharp in cities including New York, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Las Vegas and San Francisco, where there have been double-digit hikes.

Readers of The Wall Street Journal have complained intensely, said travel columnist Dawn Gilbertson.

She summarized some of their key complaints.

Repairs and upgrades that were shelved amid the pandemic have sometimes been abandoned entirely, WSJ readers complained.

One reader said he and his business travel colleagues have a competition to see who has a working ice machine on the hotel floor. The winner buys drinks for the group.

Complaints about maintenance have risen 3 percent, according to the latest J.D. Power North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index.

This year's survey polled over 34,000 hotel guests for stays between May 2021 and May 2022.

One guest of a Hilton Hotel on Wednesday tweeted: '@hilton @HiltonHHonors staying at your Hilton Tapestry in Knoxville, Tn. When did u guys remove the ice buckets for the rooms? Call to ask for a bucket was told I would have to come down to get ice? As a Diamond member this is unacceptable. Please help me understand?'

'@WyndhamHotels my room in South Boston VA does not have a working TV. Told the front desk this morning and nothing was done. Spent a 3 days with no tv. Checkout tomorrow. Last hotel was no hot water, now no tv. Come on‚Ä¶'

Bharat Patel, a hotel owner and chairman of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association trade group, told the paper that the biggest challenge at the moment was finding enough staff.

He said he could deal with other problems easily, but staffing was a significant hurdle.

'I can deal with almost any supply issue,' he says. 'If we're out of eggs, double up on bacon. Everyone wants protein.'

An STR report this month found that hotel profit margins are growing, because of higher room rates and cheaper operating costs 'through reduced services, lower employment levels and changes in operation.'

Chekitan Dev, professor at Cornell University's Nolan School of Hotel Administration, told the paper that the hotels have 'service delusion' - believing they can get away with fewer front-desk workers today because it worked during the pandemic, when travelers wanted fewer interactions.

'@Hyatt I picked up some trash in the hallway because apparently maid service is no longer a 3 star amenity and I was tired of stepping over it,' tweeted one angry guest.

Another complained: @HolidayInn @Expedia so trying to check into HI Express in Rochester and no rooms available yet, because only one cleaning person for entire hotel.

'Can't say when I'll get a room or let me cancel.'

The staffing shortages was frequently felt on customer service helplines.

'I've reached out to @WyndhamHotels customer service 3 times with no response. Is this company a joke now?' tweeted one guest on Wednesday.

Another angry guest complained on Wednesday about Holiday Inn: 'Still not resolved. They won't even call back or acknowledge their mistake! Customer service is the worst. @HolidayInn.'

A third said: '@Hilton what happened with your customer service lately? Been in two hotel in the last two nights and have never been more disappointed. It's pretty embarrassing to be a Diamond status with you right now.'

The industry is desperate to build less expensive electric vehicles for the masses because (alongside concerns around range and charging availability) price is one of the biggest barriers to mass EV adoption.

The new EVs cost an average of $65,041 in November, according to Kelley Blue Book, while gas cars averaged $48,681 that month.

Automakers say they are doing all they can to introduce cheaper EVs. For instance, the Chevrolet Equinox SUV EV, to launch in 2023, should start around $30,000. Many have long been targeting that number, though Tesla somewhat tapped out of the race this year. Elon Musk told investors earlier this year his company wasn't prioritizing the $25,000 EV anymore.

High EV prices stem, in part, from the domination of luxury vehicles in the market. Ford's F-150 Lightning electric pickup starts at nearly $56,000; the GMC Hummer EV costs more than $100,000. Startup Rivian tacked a $73,000 based price tag onto its R1T truck, and Lucid raised the price of the cheapest variant of its Air sedan to $87,400.

But the more stubborn problem comes from the battery industry and the simple law of supply and demand.

The world of batteries influences your EV's price tag

Automakers are pouring more than $515 billion into all-electric lineups over the next several years. GM and BMW are planning for at least 50% of their new vehicle sales to be EV by 2030, and GM wants to eliminate all emissions-producing cars by 2035. Ford's targeting 40% of its global cars sold electrified by 2030. Mercedes is only making newly launched cars electric starting in 2025. Scaling up will inherently make electric cars less expensive over time.

But in the short term, the surge in demand was enough to reverse a decade-long decline in battery prices, according to a recent analysis from BloombergNEF. This year, prices for crucial lithium-ion batteries rose about 7%.

It's simple: The more EVs that carmakers plan to make, the more they need raw materials for their batteries. The less available supply there is, the higher the prices for those materials can go ‚Äî and the more expensive your battery is overall.

The demand has ultimately sparked a frenzy that continues to make the battery the most costly part of an EV.

The price of lithium alone skyrocketed 500% this year, according to McKinsey. That metal could be the biggest roadblock to cheaper EVs.

""You're going to have more and more people trying to source larger quantities of the supply of lithium to make sure that they have whatever they need to operate for the next fiscal year,"" Craig Dillard, partner at firm Foley & Lardner, told Insider in the fall.

""They need to be thinking about where the material is sourced,"" Dillard said, and ""how much the price of lithium impacts not only their profitability, but also pricing in general for their products.""

Some signals suggest that might not be the case for long.

Higher adoption of lower-cost battery mixes plays a role alongside recycling, as will easing lithium prices as a result of more extraction and refining coming online.

Rick Gottscho, EVP and strategic advisor to the CEO and former CTO at Lam Research recently spoke with me about Lam‚Äôs article in Nature that showed how AI can help accelerate process engineering for semiconductors (there was also a March IEEE Spectrum article on this topic).

He said that the company is developing ways to accelerate semiconductor process development in a virtual environment, creating digital twins for everything going on in semiconductor processing. Particularly in etch and deposition operations. Traditionally these have all been developed using empirical methods. There is lots of tweaking in chemical processes, particularly as the process complexity increases. He said that there are more than 100 trillion different chemical process recipes that can run on Lam equipment. Traditional design of experiments to develop the best processes is time consuming with so many variables and expensive in time and money.

To create effective modeling and optimization of these processes doesn‚Äôt need the greatest level of accuracy, it just needs to be good enough, to enable fast learning at low cost. An initial approach to accomplish this is to develop a model that is simple, but not too simple. It should allow evaluating problems that are pretty close to what is done with their machines and using variable parameters. It should include important non-linearities and basic physics. It needs only to show trends in the right direction, not quantitative accuracy.

In order to make progress with such an approach they needed to have the ML algorithm learn from process engineers. Results from human designed experiments could be used for rough tuning of the model and at the end to further tuning. The goal was to get within 10-25% of the multidimensional target. A particular process that makes wide use of LAM equipment is making high aspect ratio holes for 3D NAND flash. The 3D NAND flash announcements by Micron and SK hynix requires stack of over 230 layers and future 3D NAND flash could go to 1,000 layers or more. Rick said that it can cost $1,000 for a half day etch for a 3D NAND hole in a real environment.

The Lam approach uses a Baysesian optimization routine, rather than true deep learning. Once prior known information was incorporated into the model the algorithm designed experiments based upon these previous results. These new experiments could involve, for example, 11 parameters. When the new results were obtained with process tests these were fed back into the model to create a new set of designed experiments. This process was iterated to develop a final optimized process. The algorithm uses a statistical approach drawing upon the distribution of parameters. Virtual experiments might be run for 100 times for each set of conditions to build up these statistics.

The combination of human experience and expertise combined with ML algorithms to do the modelling and optimization of processes like this resulted in having tighter tolerances and at less than half the cost and time of doing the same process development using only human experts. The actual model calculations are being done in the cloud using a modified version of commercial software that LAM provides to customers to simulate their process results in 3D. The code is modified to add physics-based mechanisms and is calibrated to the data. Heuristic input from publications is also inputted into the simulator.

One of the big issues for the physical analysis of the process recipes is metrology. The experiments can take less than a day to run, but measurements of process results can take longer times.

Rick also talked about taking this work to another level to create what he called a Semiverse. This would start by creating a ‚Äúdigital cousin‚Äù that will improve with more data to become a ‚Äúdigital twin.‚Äù The image below shows how this concept could improve semiconductor process development at lower cost, and provide workforce development and the barriers that stand in the way of developing this concept.

There is a great value one can learn by using environments that are close to but not identical to the processes being modeled. He said that such digital cousins can be a workforce development tool to teach process engineers and reduce the cost of learning using actual physical equipment and for real time learning evaluation. Also, accessing such virtual environments is much easier than using the actual physical equipment.

Rick said that a Semiverse won‚Äôt be created overnight. It must be built virtual brick by virtual brick. Models will fail and need to be improved and this whole system is learning over time. The path to precisions is iteration, so that eventually a digital cousin will become a true digital twin!

Allstate ALL -0.79%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Progressive PGR -2.54%decrease; red down pointing triangle , two of the nation‚Äôs biggest car insurers, say inflation continues to hurt their auto-insurance businesses, and are pushing ahead with additional premium-rate increases for vehicle owners.

The two giants, and many other big car insurers, say higher claims costs continue to dent their results, despite slowing inflation. Prices continue to rise for auto parts, they say, and vehicles are taking longer to be repaired than in past years due to shortages of workers. Those delays, in turn, lead to extended rental-car use by policyholders, at the insurers‚Äô expense.

Allstate‚Äôs first-quarter results were also badly hurt by outsize catastrophe losses, including unusually severe storms across the country in March.

Allstate Chief Executive Tom Wilson acknowledged in an interview that there ‚Äúwas a huge increase in average price‚Äù over the past year for vehicle owners. But he said that costs rose strongly, ‚Äúso we didn‚Äôt make as much progress on profit improvement‚Äù as intended.

Allstate said it raised rates by an average of 8.4% in 28 states in this year‚Äôs first three months, on top of increases averaging 11% in last year‚Äôs fourth quarter in 38 states, and 14% average increases in the third quarter in 19 states. Mr. Wilson said the company would continue to pursue rate increases ‚Äúuntil we get back to historical profit margins.‚Äù

Progressive shares slipped 2.5% Wednesday, following the release of a quarterly shareholder letter in which the chief executive disclosed a reduction in advertising expenditures for the company, well known for its extensive marketing featuring ‚ÄúFlo,‚Äù a fictional salesperson.

Tricia Griffith, chief executive of Progressive, said the move, being accompanied by premium-rate increases, isn‚Äôt intended to bring growth ‚Äúto a screeching halt.‚Äù Any impact would depend on how rivals also adjust their prices in the face of inflation.

Progressive is planning an additional round of rate increases, on top of premium hikes of more than 13% in 2022 and an additional 4% in the first quarter, Ms. Griffith said in her letter.

The company needs rate increases ‚Äúof around 10 more points this year to catch up and stay ahead of the trend‚Äù of the higher costs in claims for private-passenger vehicles, she told analysts in the call. Requested increases could range from 8% to 12%, she said.

Car insurers‚Äô struggles with inflation come after a long stretch of outsize profits during the pandemic, as they benefited from Americans working from home rather than commuting. Back then, rush-hour fender-benders‚Äîa leading source of claims‚Äîwere running well below prepandemic levels.

In earnings calls over the past couple of weeks, car-insurance executives have made clear ‚Äúthat driving and crashes are at or near pre-pandemic levels,‚Äù said William Wilt, president of Assured Research LLC, a research and advisory firm serving the property-casualty insurance industry.

Travelers Cos. said last month that it raised car-insurance rates by 14% on renewed policies in the first quarter. An executive said the company expects the figure ‚Äúto be modestly higher than this level throughout the remainder of 2023.‚Äù

Mark Dwelle, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a report that Travelers has ‚Äúmiles to go to get back to actual ‚Äògood‚Äô results,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúLess bad is a step in the right direction.‚Äù

Allstate swung to a first-quarter net loss of $346 million, down from $634 million in net profit in the year-earlier period. Catastrophe costs surged to $1.69 billion, from $462 million in the year-earlier period.

The company said that property-liability earned premiums, an industry measure of premium growth, increased by $1.1 billion, or nearly 11% from the year-earlier period, due to rate increases on auto and home insurance. The company also cut costs, but the auto-loss costs paired with the ‚Äúexceptionally high‚Äù first-quarter catastrophe losses led to an underwriting loss of $1 billion. In the year-earlier quarter there was a $280 million gain.

The poll of nearly 2,200 U.S. adults carried out Thursday and Friday found 16% moved some or all of their money, though most transferred their assets to regional, local or digital banks. Some 73% of those who moved money are men, while 58% are members of the Millennial generation and almost half (46%) reported owning cryptocurrency‚Äîall numbers far higher than the makeup of the general U.S. population.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures up to $250,000 in each bank account in the event of a bank failure. The Treasury Department took the unusual step of letting depositors withdraw all of their money after SVB‚Äôs collapse, though, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has suggested similar measures could be taken if more banks fail.

What To Watch For

The poll found 23% of American adults are considering ‚Äústarting a relationship‚Äù with a new bank in the next six months‚Äîup from 15% in a February Morning Consult survey.

SVB‚Äôs collapse on March 10 following a social media-fueled bank run has roiled the banking industry‚Äîespecially some regional banks‚Äîdue to liquidity concerns. The run on SVB came after it announced plans to sell additional stock to raise funds, signaling that its decision to invest billions of dollars‚Äô worth of deposits in government bonds backfired when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. New York-based Signature Bank failed just days later under similar circumstances, while San Francisco-based First Republic Bank also appeared on a path toward collapse until big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo announced they‚Äôd make $30 billion in deposits in an attempt to rescue the beleaguered bank. First Republic‚Äôs stock has continued to crater, though‚Äîdeclining more than 87% in recent weeks‚Äîand it has reportedly reached out to JPMorgan Chase to explore a potential sale. SVB and Signature had far different client bases than most American banks, though, with Signature focused on crypto and SVB aligned with tech startups that largely had high-dollar accounts‚Äîabout 93% of SVB‚Äôs deposits were above the traditional $250,000 per account the FDIC insures, a far greater proportion than most banks.

The FDIC has set a deadline of 8 p.m. Wednesday for prospective buyers to submit bids to buy SVB (the Treasury Department took control of the bank after it collapsed). The deadline has been delayed several times, however, and it‚Äôs unclear if a buyer will emerge Wednesday evening.

There are two types of banks, broadly speaking. First, commercial banks, which primarily serve consumers and businesses by accepting their deposits and extending loans to them. Second, investment banks, which help institutions and governments navigate complex financial transactions such as trading, mergers and acquisitions.

Intuitively, the way they make money is different. Commercial banks reap profits from the difference in interest rates between the loans they make and the deposits they receive, while investment banks earn fees on their dealmaking activity.

Bank of America belongs to the first category; Goldman the second. This explains why their earnings, fundamentally, diverged so much. In today's high interest rate environment, commercial banks tend to earn more since they can charge higher rates for their loans while keeping deposit rates low, whereas investment banks typically see a fall in fees because of reduced financial activity.

Goldman, of course, knows that ‚Äî it's been trying to diversify into commercial bank through Marcus, its retail-focused business. But that endeavor's making losses rather than boosting profits and might face threats of ""cannibalization"" ‚Äî as CEO David Solomon put it ‚Äî from Apple's new savings account, launched in partnership with Goldman itself.

Investors punished Goldman for the bank's lackluster quarterly results and apparently confusing strategy, sending its shares down 1.7% ‚Äî and they dipped a further 0.18% in after-hours trading. Investors were also let down by Johnson & Johnson's sales forecast. The company's shares dropped 2.81%.

Nevertheless, U.S. markets were mostly flat. Investors were probably more worried about interest rates, a problem of the future, than earnings reports, a snapshot of the past. And for good reason: Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he anticipates ""one more move"" on rate hikes, followed by a pause ""for quite some time.""

Higher interest rates for longer means tighter margins, lower profits for companies and a general slowdown in the economy. No wonder markets are still, despite the bevy of earnings reports from big companies.

This has opened up more of an opportunity to profitably lend in auto, even by picking off only the best borrowers. Banks such as Fifth Third and U.S. Bancorp this past week said they have been selling or scaling back auto loans, and credit unions have also been contracting due to aggressive pricing. This is due to a combination of higher car prices and rising interest rates, and it is unclear who exactly is a prime borrower due to rising savings rates.","A pullback in lending by banks and credit unions is giving some the green light to lend, even amid signs of borrower stress.",COF,Financials,Consumer Finance,Capital One Financial,2023-07-23T13:00:00+00:00,2023-07-23,2023-07-23T13:00:00+00:00,[],"Fewer auto lenders may be on the road, improving the drive for everyone else. That isn‚Äôt a license to speed like crazy, though.

Among subprime auto borrowers, delinquency rates that were quite low during the pandemic have moved well past normal. Executives at Equifax on Thursday told analysts that delinquency rates for subprime auto borrowers aren‚Äôt only above prepandemic levels, they are above the levels reached after the 2008 financial crisis in 2009 and 2010.

The biggest auto lenders will steer clear of this, because they have portfolios tilted much more toward more reliable borrowers. Even so, delinquency rates and losses are rising for higher-quality portfolios, too. Ally Financial this past week said it is now predicting a retail auto net charge-off rate of 1.8% this year, which was at the top end of its previously given range. This is versus a historical average for 2017 to 2019 of around 1.4%. Capital One Financial‚Äôs COF 0.50%increase; green up pointing triangle auto net charge-off rate was 1.4% in the second quarter, up 0.79 percentage point from a year earlier.

Amid all that, some lenders are pulling over. This has opened up more of an opportunity to profitably lend in auto‚Äîeven by picking off only the best borrowers. Ally told analysts on Wednesday that potential returns on super-prime loans were ‚Äúsignificantly higher than normal.‚Äù Capital One Financial said on Thursday that though it had its ‚Äúfoot on the brake‚Äù in auto for a while, ‚Äúin the very recent months, we‚Äôve seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more.‚Äù

This comes as banks such as Fifth Third and U.S. Bancorp this past week said they have been selling or scaling back auto loans. There has also been a sharp contraction among credit unions, whose aggressive pricing had previously been making things harder for bank lenders. Cox Automotive‚Äôs Dealertrack Auto Credit Availability Index in June showed a nearly 17% decrease year-over-year by credit unions, versus just a 7.5% pullback among banks.

The best customers default less often. But they also command lower interest rates, pressuring lending yields. Ally told analysts that its ‚Äúoriginated yield declined in the quarter as we‚Äôve increased the superprime proportion of our volume.‚Äù Those yields will need to stay relatively high to prevent rising funding costs from squeezing profitability further. It also puts the onus on credit performance to help keep returns as high as possible.

Plus, credit risk even for better borrowers may be hard to predict right now. For one, there is the risk that used-car prices decline more than anticipated, making it harder to recover as much on a loan when selling a repossessed car. That is on top of other unprecedented developments in the auto market, like the number of borrowers who now have monthly car payments above $1,000, due to a combination of higher car prices and rising interest rates. Even the well-heeled may balk at this kind of spending.

More broadly, Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank on Thursday described what he called a ‚Äúdeferred charge-off effect.‚Äù Because credit performance over the past three years was so unprecedented across consumer credit, he said that there is likely ‚Äúsome catching up that happens on the other side of that, especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged-off over the past three years.‚Äù That includes the question of who exactly is a prime borrower, with Fairbank noting that rising savings rates meant a lot more subprime customers had moved into prime in recent years, possibly creating misleading data for credit models.

Lending to wealthier borrowers can help avoid credit risk, especially if it is well-priced. But it isn‚Äôt a cheat code.","Seeing Open Road, Some Auto Lenders Step on the Gas",causal,COF,"['S', 'U']",['A'],['COF'],"['COF', 'S', 'A', 'U']",-0.4492504

The gaming industry trade group said the $220 billion figure is up from the $125 billion that had been wagered by the four-year mark of the May 14, 2018, Supreme Court decision on a New Jersey case that was the longest of long shots: a bid to overturn a federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, that restricted sports betting to just four states that met a 1991 deadline to legalize it.

Now, 29 states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports betting, and more states are expected to do the same in the coming months of years.

 ‚ÄúWhile the milestones of legalized sports betting that have led up to now are remarkable, this industry is excitingly still far from being fully realized,‚Äù Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, one of the industry's two dominant companies, told the AP. 



‚ÄúLegal betting is already part of mainstream sports culture, and I anticipate this trend will grow as adoption increases,‚Äù Robins said. ‚ÄúThe accessibility right now for fans to place a live, micro-bet during a game, for example, shares parallels with other smartphone-powered capabilities like hailing a ride, buying a stock, or playing a podcast.‚Äù States have a strong incentive to legalize sports gambling. Sports betting taxes on operators have generated about $3.6 billion in revenue: $3 billion for state and local governments, and $570 million for the federal government.

States take different approaches to the tax structure. Some have high tax rates between 36 percent and 51 percent, but most are between 10 percent and 15 percent. Those treating compulsive gambling say calls to their hotlines seeking help have increased by about 15 percent in the five years since sports betting was legalized and made available on cell phones.

Of particular note, according to a separate report from Stateline, a publication of States Newsroom, a national nonprofit news outlet, calls to gambling hotlines by men ages 18-25 are up. The national problem gambling helpline is 1-800-GAMBLER. Help by state is available, too. Other problems have occurred as well, including the suspension of several NFL players for betting on games. Also, some colleges struck partnerships with sports leagues and illegally marketed sports betting to students under the legal age of 21, prompting leagues and gambling companies to revise their policies. And last week, regulators in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey ordered their sports books to stop taking bets on the University of Alabama baseball team after suspicious activity was identified in an Alabama-Louisiana State University game on April 28. Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon was fired amid an investigation that began when one of the numerous companies monitoring sports betting data and other activities found what it considered suspicious activity and tipped off gambling regulators. No criminal charges have been filed. In some ways, the growth of sports betting has been a business success story.

Sports books, which generally keep about 10 percent of all the money they handle after paying out winning bets, are finally seeing profitability. They have kept $17 billion in winnings over the last five years, according to the American Gaming Association. It is a fairly concentrated market, though. Five years in, just two companies control over 70 percent of the legal sports betting market in the United States, according to the gambling analytics firm Eilers & Krejcik. In the 12-month period ending with Feb. 2023, FanDuel has just under 46 percent of the market, while DraftKings has more than 25 percent. BetMGM has nearly 12 percent, Caesars Entertainment has 6.7 percent, and no one else has more than 2.4 percent, the company said. Sports betting has also kept the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City, alive.

 ‚ÄúSports betting has saved the day,‚Äù said Jeff Gural, who operates the track in East Rutherford that includes a FanDuel sportsbook, which combined with FanDuel's online operation takes in nearly 50 cents of every dollar wagered on sports in New Jersey. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the Meadowlands would be open as a racetrack now without sports betting,‚Äù he said.

Consumer protection was also part of the argument for legalized sports betting, because it allows people to bet with entities that are regulated by the government, where their deposits are secure and there‚Äôs no danger of a sports book suddenly disappearing with their cash.

 However, the avalanche of advertising for sports betting triggered a backlash to the point where the gambling industry and most major professional sports leagues adopted stronger standards for their own advertisements. These were widely seen as an attempt not only to do something about the proliferation of gambling, and particularly sports betting ads, but also to be seen as doing something and hopefully head off threatened government regulation of sports betting ads. What will the next five years look like? Chris Krafcik of Eilers & Krejcik predicts more multi-faceted deals among teams, leagues and stadiums, and among betting operators and media companies, hotel chains, and beverage companies.

 Krafcik said sports betting companies could develop VIP-focused retail destinations, and look to expand ‚Äúhyper-casual‚Äù online wagering. The trend of gambling companies locating sportsbooks in or next to pro sports stadiums is likely to continue. Sports books as a whole may slow down their promotional spending to rein in costs. And uncertainty should continue in the near term about the prospects for online sports betting in California, the nation's largest state, and in Florida, where it is tied up in litigation.",$220B Wagered On Sports Bets In 5 Years Since Supreme Court Ruling,non-causal,"AP, CEO, VIP, NFL",[],[],"['NFL', 'AP', 'CEO', 'VIP']","['NFL', 'AP', 'CZR', 'CEO', 'VIP']",-0.9986208

But investors shouldn‚Äôt assume banks can just keep on snubbing depositors.

Though the Federal Reserve has pegged market rates of interest above 5%, getting more than 4% on a savings account is tough. A handful of banks are there, such as Pittsburgh-based PNC and Goldman Sachs‚Äô online arm Marcus, but the average rate paid in May was 0.73%, data from think tank Center for Financial Stability suggests.

Of course, where bank customers lose, investors gain. With most Wall Street megabanks set to report second-quarter earnings next week and their European counterparts a week later, a correct assessment of ‚Äúdeposit betas‚Äù‚Äîthe portion of rate changes that banks pass on to depositors‚Äîis crucial.

The CFS figure is very broad and underplays what banks offer new customers. Financial filings suggest that deposits at big lenders such as JPMorgan and Bank of America return between 1.3% and 2%. Moreover, it was normal before 2008 for deposits to yield less than central-bank rates. Still, today‚Äôs gap between the two is unusually wide.

The trend in Europe is similar. In the U.K., instant-access deposits paid 1.83% in June even as rates rose to 5%, sparking accusations of profiteering from lawmakers. In the eurozone, households and companies got a 2.4% and 3% return in May, respectively, while the European Central Bank rate reached 3.5%.

But investors who expect this situation to last may be too complacent. During the first quarter, even small increases in deposit costs forced analysts to trim their net interest margin forecasts for U.S. banks. In Europe, Germany‚Äôs Commerzbank warned about a peak in interest margins. The same could happen in the coming earnings season.

Median sell-side forecasts collected by Visible Alpha see margins expanding powerfully this year, and then giving up some of those gains in 2024 as deposit expenses catch up. However, even these 2024 margins would be about 0.3 percentage-point narrower at several major global banks if deposit betas rose to their historical averages, assuming constant interest rates, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest.

It could be that central banks start lowering rates again next year, as derivatives markets seem to assume. In that case, it is forecasts for returns on loans that could start to look overly optimistic.

The ECB recently warned in its biannual financial-stability outlook that bank funding costs could jump as clients shift money from overnight to higher-yielding term deposits. Because of the past decade of near-zero rates, the former makes up a whopping 61% of eurozone deposits, compared with 39% in 2013.

Similarly, negative-yielding short-term debt made people avoid money-market funds, which relative to deposits have stagnated on both sides of the Atlantic since 2010. Now, they are paying 4.8% in the U.S., according to Crane Data. This is stiff competition, especially for smaller lenders seen as risky after the March banking crisis.

Individual savers can often take a while to start seeking yield. But they are on the case now: Money-market fund holdings in the U.S. have ballooned to record levels. The Bank of England recently noted that U.K. households withdrew the highest volume of funds on record from banks in May, which was partially offset by an inflow into time deposits.

‚ÄúBetween higher returns and lower risk, the movement out of bank deposits is going to accelerate and we expect we are going to see a stampede out of bank deposits in the coming months,‚Äù said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Opimas.

Many analysts appear to disagree, citing a number of reasons why deposit betas will stay lower for longer, particularly for big banks. These institutions have become more concentrated, and user-friendly online-banking applications could make their deposit franchises stronger than in the past.

Then again, for banks as a whole, it is also possible to argue the opposite. Digital platforms have made it easier for savers to shop around for higher-yielding products and shift their money accordingly, be it into money-market funds or the offerings of new online and fintech players, which have risen to dominate new checking accounts. Europe may offer a natural experiment: Banks in France and the Netherlands, countries with more modern financial ecosystems that include more fintech options, have increased deposit rates far above those in Italy, Spain and Portugal, data by Jefferies analysts suggests.

In the wake of the bank's collapse, one tech writer, Evan Armstrong, pointed out a mail-out authored by fellow writer Bryne Hobart, dated February 23.

'This entire debacle was potentially caused by [Hobart]'s newsletter,' wrote Armstrong, who then shared his own post detailing how Hobart may have knocked over the first domino.

'Pretty much every VC I know reads this newsletter,' said Armstrong, suggesting that as venture capital executives became wary of Silicon Valley Bank their fears spread like a contagion.

In Hobart's February post he pointed out that Silicon Valley Bank had a debt-to-asset ratio of 185:1 and that it was 'technically insolvent' in the last quarter of last year.

'The tech world is more risk-averse than it used to be,' he wrote, before describing SVB as 'a bank that's still levered 185:1 on an asset base that includes, among other things, ""Premium wine""-backed loans in an amount almost equal to last quarter's marked-to-market equity.'

The bank is known for its lending to the wine industry and even had a Premium Wine Division headquartered in Napa.

It reported in fourth-quarter filings last year that 1.6 percent, or $1.16 billion, of its $74.3 billion loan portfolio was to clients with premium wineries and vineyards.

'After all, the signs of SVB's potential implosion were there last year. However, all it took was a few VCs to act on it before the whole thing spiraled out of control,' wrote Armstrong on his blog.

Hobart is the author or The Diff, a newsletter which claims to have around 50,000 paying subscribers.

The Diff's website includes testimonials from hedge fund managers and tech analysts praising the quality of Hobart's insights.

'Byrne's work is truly the outcome of someone who thinks, and thinks differently and deeply,' wrote one. 'He reads like an industrial vacuum and synthesizes like a minimoog,' said another.

Nonetheless in his blog Hobart did suggest that collapse was unlikely in spite of the bank's huge liabilities.

'It would take an absolutely titanic bank run to actually impair the company's liquidity, so a run is unlikely,' he wrote.

Hobart went so far as to predict that even if the bank were to collapse measures would be in place to ensure individuals with deposits in the bank would not be impacted.

'And even if the company did run into trouble, there are good political reasons to think that depositors wouldn't be harmed,' he added.

After news of the struggle Silicon Valley Bank customers started lining up outside of one of franchises more than four hours before the bank opened to ensure they could get their money out.

Federal regulators had announced they are taking emergency measures to ensure that customers will have access to their funds.

In a speech on Monday morning, President Joe Biden said, none of the losses will be born on the taxpayers, but will rather be paid by the fees banks pay the federal government.

'The bottom line is: Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe, your deposits are safe,' the president said.

He did however suggest that investors in the bank would not be protected. 'That's how capitalism works,' he said.

In a newsletter sent out on February 23, Hobart wrote: 'This is a pretty striking occurrence: on a mark-to-market basis, they were broke last quarter, albeit still liquid. And that liquidity matters; one reason banks aren't required to mark assets to market is that they can hold them indefinitely as long as they have deposits. On the other hand, Silicon Valley Bank's deposits are less sticky than other companies', since they're provided by mostly money-burning companies. The lack of mark-to-market accounting is a reflection of general banking reality, that banks don't get explicitly margin-called by customers. They do sometimes experience runs. It would take an absolutely titanic bank run to actually impair the company's liquidity, so a run is unlikely. And even if the company did run into trouble, there are good political reasons to think that depositors wouldn't be harmed: the people who donate the legal maximum to political campaigns are disproportionately likely to bank with Silicon Valley or work for companies that do. 'On the other hand, the tech world is more risk-averse than it used to be, and depositing money into a bank that's still levered 185:1 on an asset base that includes, among other things, ""Premium wine""-backed loans in an amount almost equal to last quarter's marked-to-market equity.[1] No one wants to look paranoid by being the first to move their money out, but no one wants to deal with the consequences of being last. And if money does flow out, they eventually have to start selling assets, which turns an ""unrealized losses"" footnote into a headline loss number.'

Silicon Valley Bank was founded in the 1980s and quickly developed a reputation for being a tech-savvy lender to young computer startups in their early stages.

Over the course of the next four decades it grew to become the 16th largest bank in the US, catering to tech companies around the world.

As the industry boomed in the pandemic years the bank's services came to be in high demand and its deposits grew as companies used it to store cash for growing payrolls, among other things.

Its demise however began after making major investments in US government bonds, backed by mortgages and with low interest rates.

As the Fed started to hike interest rates last year those bonds dropped in value and the bank's debt-to-asset ratio became increasingly precarious.

As Silicon Valley companies found themselves in hard times last year and sought to withdraw money from the bank, it struggled to meet withdrawals and was forced to sell assets prematurely incurring losses that spooked investors.

Last week SVB went insolvent and on Friday was taken over by the government following a run on its deposits and a collapse in its stock price.

To put it bluntly, the administration‚Äôs zealotry in fighting climate change by unwisely‚Äîand illegally‚Äîattempting to convert federal financial regulators into environmental activists is inextricably intertwined with these bank failures and the fallout from them. Your warping of the financial regulatory system undermines both the safe and sound operation of financial institutions and the public‚Äôs faith in the fairness and efficacy of the regulatory regime. We urge you to change course and refocus your efforts on managing actual financial risk. It is time to turn away from this mistaken path and refocus federal efforts on actual financial risks that have the ability to do real harm to the national economy. Attempting to use the financial system to pursue environmental goals does nothing but increase risk. For example, banks that refused to do business with coal companies, but rushed to partner with green technology companies, made the wrong bet over the past two years, as coal company cash flow has skyrocketed while rising interest rates have exposed the weakness in many green energy business models. Serving a diversified customer base means having customers who generate cash flow that can help a financial institution offset the struggles of other customers. You should publicly direct banks to pursue profitability, liquidity, and prudent risk management and note that declining to serve customers for failing to comply with unrealistic climate initiatives like achieving net zero by 2050 is a threat to the financial system. You should make clear that no agency, nor any agency personnel, has authority to pressure any bank to increase its exposure to net-zero compliant customers or to decline to do business with companies for not being net-zero compliant. You should also direct banks to stop setting emissions reductions targets that are inherently arbitrary and undermine public confidence in the financial system.

2023-03-21 Letter to Treasury Fed Reserve OCC FDIC Re SVB[26] by Breitbart News on Scribd

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who led the letter, said in a statement:

At the beginning of the month, SVB collapsed when panicked customers suddenly withdrew tens of billions of dollars after it announced a loss of approximately $1.8 billion from selling its investments in U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Ultimately, regulators shut down the bank, and the FDIC took control. It was later said that the government would protect all depositors, even those past FDIC‚Äôs $250,000 limit.

SVB reopened last Monday as Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., under FDIC control. Both insured and uninsured had all assets transferred to the bridge bank. The bridge bank allows time for the agency to stabilize the institution and market the franchise. Until further notice, the bridge bank will continue to operate as a nationally chartered bank, so depositors have full access to all of their money.

The Senate on Thursday voted 80-15 to pass a bill binding rail companies and workers to a proposed settlement that was reached between the railroads and union leaders.

Critics say the contract that did not receive backing from enough union members lacked sufficient levels of paid leave for rail workers.

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents 29,000 people, said last week that 53.5 percent of its members had voted to ratify the deal offered by the coalition of the nation's biggest freight railroads, including Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, BNSF and Kansas City Southern. In rejecting the contract, the conductors‚Äô union said it failed to address demanding schedules and quality of life issues of employees. Seven smaller unions have approved the contract, which on top of the 24 percent pay bump, includes a $5,000 bonus.

A strike would have halted shipments of food and fuel at a cost of $2 billion a day, according to a report earlier this year by the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group. Supply chain issues are easing, but likely would become tangled again by a strike, according to the report. Virginia Railway Express operations staff would not be part of a labor strike, the agency said in September. But the commuter rail uses CSX- and Norfolk Southern-owned tracks to operate its trains. Without any dispatchers, the tracks would be shut down and VRE would suspend operations, InsideNoVa reported when strike worries first surfaced.

‚ÄúAny labor strike would result in the immediate suspension of all VRE train service until a resolution is reached,‚Äù VRE said two months ago. While Amtrak's service north of D.C. along the Northeast Corridor would likely not be affected by a strike, the passenger railroad said ‚Äúa small number‚Äù of Northeast Regional departures to the south could be affected. Amtrak owns most of the tracks that it uses in the Northeast Corridor, WTOP said. The passenger railway company previously said routes between Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., would see ‚Äúno impact.‚Äù

 Frustrated workers pushed to reject these contracts because they don't resolve workers‚Äô key quality-of-life concerns. The deals for the engineers and conductors did include a promise to try to improve the scheduling of regular days off and negotiate the details of those schedules further at each railroad.

 The unions that represent engineers and conductors also received three unpaid days off a year to tend to medical needs as long as they were scheduled at least 30 days in advance.

The railroads also lost out on their bid to cut crew sizes down to one person as part of the negotiations. But the conductors in the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union still narrowly rejected the deal. The railroads maintain that the deals with the unions should closely follow the recommendations made this summer by a special panel of arbitrators Biden appointed. That's part of the reason why they don't want to offer paid sick time. Plus, the railroads say the unions have agreed over the years to forgo paid sick time in favor of higher pay and strong short-term disability benefits. The unions say it is long overdue for the railroads to offer paid sick time to workers, and the pandemic highlighted the need for it.",National Railway Strike Blocked Ahead Of Holidays: What It Means In VA,non-causal,"VRE, CSX, WTOP, BNSF","['CSX', 'BNSF']","['S', 'VA', 'U']","['CSX', 'BNSF', 'WTOP', 'VRE']","['U', 'S', 'WTOP', 'VA', 'VRE', 'BNSF', 'CSX', 'NSC']",-0.99830127

‚Ä¢ Salaried employees with at least five years of experience qualify for the buyouts.
‚Ä¢ The move is part of a plan to cut $2 billion in costs by the end of next year.

General Motors is implementing a sweeping buyout program that covers a majority of its salaried workforce as the car company continues to cut costs to fund an electric future.

Any salaried GM employee with at least five years of experience or executive with at least two years of experience at the car company qualifies for the voluntary buyout program, sent to employees in a letter Thursday.

The buyout program is part of GM's plan to ""accelerate attrition and achieve $2 billion in cost savings by the end of 2024,"" spokesperson Maria Raynal said in an emailed statement.

Packages vary by job title and tenure. All US salaried employees with at least five years of experience are eligible for one month of pay for every year of service up to 12 months, as well as a pro-rated performance bonus and outplacement services, the spokesperson said.

Eligible employees have until March 24 to accept the buyout offer, and once approved will leave the company by June 30.

""By permanently bringing down structured costs, we can improve vehicle profitability and remain nimble in an increasingly competitive market,"" Raynal said.

GM last rationalized its workforce in 2019, slashing about 15% of its North American salaried employees at the same time the company initiated plans to close several factories. Earlier this year, some experts wondered if GM and other car companies would outrun a larger trend of layoffs hitting the tech sector due to these actions.

But as EV rollouts at the company stall, according to a report this week from The Wall Street Journal, it appears more downsizing is necessary.

            Is the bursting of the tech bubble finally spilling over to the financial system?

One day after the biggest crypto-focused bank, Silvergate Capital, announced plans to unwind and liquidate after a deposit run effectively killed its core business model, this morning its far larger peer - the parent company of the venerable Silicon Valley Bank, SVB Financial Group - saw its shares plunge the most in more than two decades after the company took ""steps to bolster its financial position"" that included not only a highly dilutive stock offering but also a panicked asset sale that sparked fears of a liquidity crisis at one of the biggest and original providers of funding to the Venture Capital industry.

The Santa Clara-based company‚Äôs shares sank by as much as 47% on Thursday, their biggest decline in the company's history since going public in 1987. The slump in the shares to their lowest level since May 2020, came after SVB i) announced a stock offering, ii) sold substantially all of the available-for-sale securities in its portfolio and iii) updated its forecast for the year to include a sharper decline in net interest income.



‚ÄúWhile we view these actions combined with a weaker guide as a clear negative, we do not believe that SIVB is in a liquidity crisis, especially following the significant proceeds‚Äù from its sale of securities, Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini wrote as he cut his price target for the company to $200 from $250. Others clearly disagreed and dumped the stock at a pace not seen in a quarter century.



The bank also said it had sold about $21 billion of securities from its portfolio (with a plan to reinvest the proceeds but don't hold your breath) which will result in an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion for the first quarter. And the cherry on top was SVB's announcement of equity offerings for $1.25 billion of its common stock and $500 million of securities that represent convertible preferred shares. Additionally, General Atlantic committed to purchase $500 million of common stock, taking the total amount being raised to about $2.25 billion.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the SIVB liquidity crisis is a function of assets, i.e., loans collateralized by toxic early stage investments that have turned sour... or liabilities, i.e., a good old-fashioned deposit bank run.

‚ÄúThe improved cash liquidity, profitability and financial flexibility resulting from the actions we announced today will bolster our financial position and our ability to support clients through sustained market pressures,‚Äù the company said in a letter to stakeholders but judging by the stock reaction, nobody believed it.

1,good,True,positive,94250,"Intel's first-quarter results late Thursday showed that the chipmaker's revenue had plunged 36% year over year, and operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion was a record. Despite this, Intel's stock price jumped nearly 5% Friday morning, and Intel's market value has been decimated over the past two years.

The chipmaker‚Äôs first-quarter results late Thursday took the ‚Äúbetter than feared‚Äù concept to a new level. Revenue plunged 36% year over year‚Äîthe company‚Äôs worst quarterly drop since at least the early ‚Äô90s, which is as far back as data from S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. Its operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion was also a record over that time frame. In another first, Intel actually lost money in its data-center segment‚Äîa business that generated operating margins of 50% in the same quarter just three years prior.

Still, those results were better than Wall Street had anticipated, and overall revenue was even a bit better than Intel‚Äôs brutal forecast three months ago. Thus, Intel‚Äôs stock price jumped nearly 5% Friday morning. It was overdue for some upside. Intel‚Äôs market value has been decimated over the past two years as the company has embarked on an expensive and risky turnaround plan to regain its manufacturing edge and build up a new business making chips designed by others, called a foundry. Before Thursday‚Äôs results, Intel‚Äôs stock price had shed one-third of its value over the previous 12 months‚Äîthe worst performance of any tech company with a market value exceeding $100 billion, according to FactSet.

To be sure, Intel still has a deep hole to climb out of. To get its manufacturing process caught up with market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, Intel is pursuing a plan to advance through five so-called manufacturing nodes in four years. The company‚Äôs latest node, which it calls Intel 4, is on track to start volume production in the second half of this year, and is Intel‚Äôs first using the extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography technology vital for producing the most advanced semiconductors. Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research calls this ‚Äúa major milestone‚Äù that will improve Intel‚Äôs competitiveness.

But Intel 4 is still based on 7-nanometer technology, while TSMC is already shipping more advanced 5-nanometer chips at high volume. The chip giant even previewed its 3-nanometer technology earlier this week, at a trade show less than 2 miles from Intel‚Äôs Silicon Valley headquarters.

Intel‚Äôs deep roots in advanced chipmaking make such a gambit plausible‚Äîif a long shot. But the company can‚Äôt afford more stumbles on that path. And it has to fund that effort while also coping with a sharp downturn in demand for both PC and data-center processors, which combined account for more than 80% of its revenue. PCs at least may start getting a little better. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Thursday‚Äôs analyst call that the bloated inventory in the PC market that has depressed chip sales there ‚Äúis tracking to be at a healthy level by the end of Q2.‚Äù

The data-center business may remain a tough market for Intel this year. Cloud giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are now focusing their capital spending on building up generative artificial intelligence capabilities, which require more of the graphics processors made by Nvidia rather than the CPU processors that Intel specializes in. And even success in its rapid catch-up effort may create new challenges; Ed Snyder of Charter Equity noted that ‚Äúreleasing five nodes in four years will probably be too fast for customers to absorb the new products anywhere close to the rate of past upgrades.‚Äù For Intel at least, that would finally be a high-quality problem to have.",Intel Faces a Long Climb Back from the Bottom,non-causal,"TSMC, PC, EUV, CPU",['TSMC'],[],"['TSMC', 'CPU', 'EUV', 'PC']","['TSMC', 'INTC', 'PC', 'CPU', 'EUV']",0.054191016

Among the themes discussed on Q1 calls were the shift from discretionary items to lower-margin essential ones (food and beverage), elevated ‚Äúshrink‚Äù (theft) and a resumption of price competition following unusually substantial price increases during the pandemic.

FreightWaves reporters have written in recent months about the weakness in U.S. box demand, an indication of the poor state of the goods economy. Americans are struggling even amid ongoing student loan forbearance that‚Äôs about to end, which will bring about yet more financial strain.

Home Depot and Lowe‚Äôs, the two largest home improvement retailers, both cut their full-year sales guidance after just one quarter of the year. For perspective, excluding Q1 2020 (when the pandemic broke out), Home Depot hadn‚Äôt cut its full-year sales guidance in Q1 dating back at least to 2006. Lowe‚Äôs last did so in 2011 based on our research.

Home Depot reported store comparable sales in the U.S. declined by 4.6% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year, while comparable sales at Lowe‚Äôs declined by 4.3%.

Both Walmart and Target reported a slowdown in sales trends in March and April compared to January and February. Walmart pointed to SNAP benefit reductions and lower tax refunds. An uptick in Social Security benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments as a result of the annual cost-of-living adjustment offset some of those pressures.

Walmart experienced pronounced weakness in its general merchandise sales, which exclude food and beverage. On its May 18 earnings call, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said continued inflation in grocery items and other necessities is forcing consumers to spend less on discretionary goods ‚Äî a trend that‚Äôs expected to continue through 2023.

‚ÄúThe persistently high rates of inflation in these categories lasting for such a long period of time are weighing on some of the families we serve,‚Äù McMillon said. ‚ÄúThis stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically general merchandise.‚Äù

Despite these challenges, Walmart raised its sales forecast for 2023.

Target CEO Brian Cornell also noted that more expensive essentials have forced consumers to cut back.

‚Äú[Consumers are] investing more in those household essentials and food and beverage items, and they‚Äôre shopping more cautiously when it comes to all things discretionary,‚Äù Cornell said in a call with reporters, according to a Yahoo Finance article.

Dollar Tree reported an uptick in same-store sales in Q1 2023, but the discount retailer nonetheless cut its full-year earnings guidance, owing to the impact of elevated shrink (most commonly theft) and the shift from discretionary items to daily essentials.

‚ÄúI think the consumer is feeling the real pressure now of a lot of things that have taken place,‚Äù Rick Dreiling, Dollar Tree chairman and CEO, said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had change in SNAP benefits, tax returns are smaller than this time last year, all the stimulus is out of the system, and all of that is taking root, and the consumer now is more focused on needs and buying to those needs as close as they can versus wants.‚Äù

Foot Locker slashed its sales outlook for 2023, pointing to ‚Äúthe tough economic backdrop, causing us to reduce our guidance for the year as we take more aggressive markdowns to both drive demand and manage inventory.‚Äù

BJ‚Äôs Wholesale Club President and CEO Bob Eddy talked about customers‚Äô reluctance to buy almost anything ‚Äúbig ticket,‚Äù like televisions or patio furniture, noting that ‚Äúit‚Äôs a very picky consumer out there at this point from a high-ticket perspective.‚Äù

Best Buy topped consensus earnings estimates in its fiscal Q1, though its sales fell short of consensus and the company noted recessionary behavior.

‚ÄúI think what we would say is we‚Äôve been seeing a consumer who is, whether or not you call it a recession, exhibiting some recessionary behaviors depending on the different category that you‚Äôre talking about. So it‚Äôs absolutely unusual,‚Äù CEO Corey Barry said on Best Buy‚Äôs earnings call.

The company noted a heightened level of promotional activity in certain categories, in some cases ‚Äúeven more promotional than they were pre-pandemic.‚Äù Best Buy highlighted appliances, computers and headphones as among the categories under the most pressure along those lines, discretionary ones all.

Costco reported its fiscal Q3 results Thursday, missing consensus on both sales and earnings. Its U.S. comparable sales excluding changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange were up 1.8% in the 12 weeks ended May 7, well below the 6% growth rate in the first six months of its fiscal year.

As did a host of other retailers this earnings season, Costco noted the strength in nondiscretionary/essential items and weakness in big-ticket discretionary ones. The company is seeing greater promotional activity as is Best Buy and noted on its conference call that it has seen consumers trading down from beef to chicken and even to products such as canned chicken, canned tuna, etc.

And RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) said Thursday it will have to take deeper markdowns than it previously expected because of deteriorating demand.

While retailers pointed to the impact from SNAP benefit reductions and lower tax refunds as among the reasons for the spending weakness, there are other major potential problems ahead.

The end of the student loan forbearance, banking crisis and potential ramifications of the debt ceiling negotiations (in terms of spending caps or cuts) could put further strain on Americans‚Äô budgets, which are already under substantial pressure judging by these retailers‚Äô comments.

Generally, this would mean banks would have to hold an additional two percentage points of capital, or an additional $2 of capital for every $100 of risk-weighted assets.

But smaller regional banks like PacWest, which is set to merge with Banc of California after reporting a $290 million decline in deposits last quarter, would be spared. In other words, these new rules would not have prevented the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank or First Republic earlier this year, said Steven Kelly, senior research associate at Yale‚Äôs program on financial stability.

Banks will no longer be able to act as their own risk managers

Under the new rules, banks with $100 billion or more in assets won‚Äôt be able to use their own models to determine the risk they‚Äôve undertaken on loans and other activities. Their risk-level assessments have been the basis for informing how much capital they need to hold on top of baseline requirements.

The new rules would force banks to use a standardized model that is more conservative than their own in terms of access risk.

Banks would be required to factor in unrealized losses and gains on securities in their portfolios in the capital ratios.

Silicon Valley Bank accumulated a lot of paper losses, or unrealized losses, from holding bonds while the Fed hiked interest rates. (Generally, interest rates on bonds go up as the Fed hikes, which leads to lower bond prices.) Eventually, SVB had to sell the bonds, which meant it had to realize the loss. But it did not need to hold capital to protect depositors from those losses.

How will this affect the average consumer?

Some officials who voted against the new regulations within the FDIC and Fed cited concerns that it could significantly constrain banks‚Äô ability to lend to businesses and individuals. Some also expressed concerns that banks would pass on their higher capital costs to consumers in the form of higher fees to maintain their profit levels.

‚ÄúThe increased capital requirements could lead to an increase in interest rates for low- and moderate-income and other historically underserved borrowers who cannot always afford a 20% down payment, making it that much harder for these families to achieve homeownership,‚Äù FDIC board member Jonathan McKernan said on Thursday at the agency‚Äôs board meeting held to vote on the new plan.

‚ÄúThose who rely on these products and services will bear the cost of capital increases,‚Äù Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who voted against the new rules, said on Thursday. ‚ÄúFor example, when a local government issues municipal bonds to finance local infrastructure, they may find that financing is more expensive, or in some cases unavailable. Manufacturers may find it harder to get loans to invest in equipment or facilities,‚Äù she added.

Kelly, who is ambivalent about the new regulations, said the average consumer will likely be ‚Äúminimally‚Äù impacted.

Non-bank financial institutions like venture capital and private equity firms will likely fill the void for any lending that traditional banks will have to cut back on, he said.

‚ÄúThis is a marginal inconvenience at best,‚Äù Kelly added. Some consumers might be forced to ‚Äúshop around a little more‚Äù to get a better interest rate on a loan. On the flip side, the regulations could give smaller banks a chance to offer more competitive rates compared to mega banks like JPMorgan Chase.

Separately, on Thursday the Fed also released new capital requirements that go into effect on October 1 for large banks, based on their stress test results last month. The minimum capital requirements that banks are subject to did not change from last year.

Some of the nation‚Äôs largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, won‚Äôt have to hold as much capital based on their performances. However, UBS, Citizens Bank and Capital One will have to hold more capital.

‚Ä¢ Talks between the Detroit 3 and the UAW come amid a backdrop of a strengthening labor movement.
‚Ä¢ UAW President Shawn Fain isn't ruling out a strike, potentially at more than one company.

The White House has weighed in as the automotive industry's labor union, the United Auto Workers, is gearing up for a fight with Detroit's Big Three car companies this summer and fall.

President Joe Biden, who has promised to be the ""most pro-union president,"" is urging the UAW and Detroit car companies to come to a ""fair agreement"" that avoids plant closures and helps usher in a transition to a ""clean energy economy.""

""I want to be clear about where I stand. I'm asking all sides to work together to forge a fair agreement,"" Biden wrote in the White House statement. ""The UAW helped create the American middle class and as we move forward in this transition to new technologies, the UAW deserves a contract that sustains the middle class.""

Ford, GM, and Stellantis (the owner of Chrysler and Jeep) returned to the bargaining table this month to hash out a new four-year agreement with the UAW, which is under new leadership following a yearslong federal investigation into financial corruption.

The fate of about 150,000 union-represented workers at the Big Three hangs in the balance as the two sides hash out the future of work in an increasingly electrified industry that will likely see less and less internal-combustion engine production and more battery production.

The talks come amid the backdrop of a newly emboldened labor movement across the country, with several high-profile strikes and organizing pushes in the entertainment, food, and retail industries. UAW President Shawn Fain, who was elected by a narrow margin in March, is leaning into this labor movement, eschewing long-standing traditions like ceremonial handshakes with the automotive CEOs in favor of connecting with his members.

He's taken to Facebook Live in recent months to speak directly to his members, preparing them for a potential strike.

""We have to be able to do whatever we have to do if you want to have these gains. The companies aren't going to freely give it,"" Fain said in June.

Fain and the UAW have withheld endorsement for President Biden's re-election campaign over concerns about the administration's actions on electric vehicles. In a statement in May, Fain warned that the EV transition could become a ""race to the bottom"" for American workers, and urged politicians to ""have our backs"" before the union makes any commitments.

Escalating tactics at the UAW predate Fain. In 2019, at the height of the union's corruption scandal, the UAW initiated a 40-day strike at GM's more than 30 US factories. The work stoppage helped the union notch wins on wages and job security, even as the company won the ability to close several factories. In the end, GM lost some $3.6 billion due to the strike.

The union, which also covers workers in other industrial industries and some academic institutions, has also had high-profile work stoppages at John Deere in 2021 and the University of California in 2022. Fain has said he is not ruling out a strike in this round of talks, potentially at more than one company.

This is the first round of negotiations between the Detroit car companies and the UAW in which electric vehicles will be front and center. EVs were an undercurrent in the 2019 negotiations, but since then the segment has grown exponentially and companies like Ford and GM have made firm commitments to build more EVs, which require less labor.

The car companies will be looking for more flexibility to respond to changes in demand for EVs, which is already creating headaches for companies like Ford. The UAW will be looking for assurances that their work will be protected even as it changes, and that wages will continue to improve even as the companies look to remain competitive with EV-makers like Tesla who use cheaper non-union labor.

Then there is the issue of powertrain production. At GM, an Ultium battery plant has taken the place of Lordstown Assembly, which closed after the 40-day strike in 2019. The labor force there joined the UAW in late 2022. Ford is building a new EV campus in Tennessee, which is not unionized.

As the industry moves away from historically unionized engine production and toward new battery plants that have not yet been unionized, the topic of job security will be at the forefront of EV talks.

Labor costs are small, but the only thing in the company's control

The cost of labor only accounts for roughly 5% of the cost of building a vehicle, but it's the only part of vehicle production costs that companies can exert control over. This small piece of the pie is going to be even more important for companies to control in the next four years as commodity costs become more difficult to predict.

The average labor costs for the Detroit Three heading into contract talks four years ago hovered between $55 and $60 per hour. After the agreements in 2019, the Center for Automotive Research forecasted labor cost increases between 13% and 20%. That average includes wages and benefits.

While it's unlikely that the companies will be able to bring these costs down, they will be looking for ways to keep them from going up too much. However, some estimates based on what the UAW has won outside the automotive industry in the last four years put potential increases in labor costs between 25% and 30% over the next four years.

Negotiations formally began at all three companies last week. The current contracts are set to expire September 14.

In recent years, the logistics industry has invested heavily in last-mile capacity, the final leg of the customer-facing supply chain. A recent study estimated this ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù niche of the logistics market alone will grow from $25 billion to $72 billion by the end of 2025. ‚ÄúLast mile‚Äù in a traditional retail supply chain typically entails moving products from a retailer‚Äôs distribution center to a physical store. But in the past decade, the rise of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer supply chains has upended that model, creating a scramble for last-mile logistics capacity across the United States, capable of delivering packages to every consumer‚Äôs residential address instead of a smaller network of retail locations.

For companies like Amazon and other e-commerce-based businesses that don‚Äôt rely on physical storefronts, last mile is a vital element of their customer experience. However, the last mile also tends to be the most laborious and expensive part of a delivery‚Äôs logistics costs, with its numerous stops and low drop sizes. For this reason, retailers, distributors and e-commerce pure-plays are constantly seeking ways to increase speed and efficiency, with Amazon Same-Day and 2-Day Delivery setting the pace for operational tempos across the entire supply chain.

During the height of the recent supply chain crisis, attention shifted to port congestion and especially long delays for unloading container ships. Since then, the backlog of ships and unloaded goods has mostly returned to healthier pre-Covid-19 levels (e.g., the Port of Los Angeles just recorded its most productive month ever). What doesn‚Äôt get as much attention, however, is the pesky middle mile‚Äîthat intermediary leg of the supply chain where products are unloaded from docked ships, moved to port terminals and placed onto trucks and trains to travel to retailers‚Äô distribution centers. Middle-mile logistics is ripe for speed and efficiency improvements, and it‚Äôs crucial to know what in this arena may be causing delays and what this may be costing you.

Many enterprise customers rely heavily on third-party logistics (3PL) platform providers to manage the warehousing and transportation needs of the middle mile, which include the costs of port operations, customs, trade compliance, stevedores and drayage providers. These providers, who often serve many enterprise customers simultaneously, can quickly become overwhelmed for any number of reasons, including labor shortages, weather-induced delays and congestion during peak times. When such a provider or one of their sub-contractors becomes overwhelmed, orders can be delayed and expediting fees can spike, leading to added costs and eroded margins.

Many 3PL providers are beginning to leverage AI and machine learning in a plethora of use cases to manage highly complex supply chains and maximize middle miles, ranging from automated warehouses to autonomous pallet packing to predictive yard management and logistics network optimization and more. Even still, because different embedded elements of these middle miles are controlled by different providers, the cost elements are opaque to teams who support supply chain operations. How do long wait times for truckers at ports impact logistics costs? What are the benefits of using a provider that offers an automated warehouse? Procurement teams often don‚Äôt have enough cost element data to determine the risks that poorly managed middle miles can pose to overall supply chain performance.

This means that as digital technology becomes more ubiquitous, enterprise procurement teams will need to be very mindful of the way logistics are procured. As the procurement of last-mile logistics is set to increase, enterprises will also increasingly be rethinking how they buy services and components of their middle miles, ranging from warehousing to specialized services. And just as AI and ML can help manufacturers with the procurement of their direct goods‚Äîquickly surfacing preferred supplier and predictive prices based on multiple attributes like quality, availability and cost‚Äîso too can retailers, distributors and e-commerce groups benefit by identifying the ideal middle mile providers and cost structures based on the relevant context-sensitive variables.

More specifically, here‚Äôs how AI and ML can help in procuring middle-mile logistics:
‚Ä¢ Real-time programmatic flagging of lead time changes: An enterprise customer may have had a traditionally good experience with a particular provider, but it becomes critical to programmatically identify exceptions and surface them to decision-makers in real time. If a preferred provider offers a longer lead time than usual, this is a clear sign the provider may be overwhelmed and if engaged now, the enterprise customer may wind up at the end of their line. Real-time exception monitoring can help enterprise customers avoid going with a constrained lane and provide recommendations on the next best option.
‚Ä¢ Tier 2 cost structure visibility: If a commonly used logistics provider‚Äôs costs suddenly change, such aberrations should also be automatically flagged, giving organizations the chance to ask the provider ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and gain insight into Tier 2 cost structures. Providers are able to deliver a detailed breakdown of costs that may include fees associated with late deliveries, weekend deliveries and demurrage fees. When enterprise customers are proactively made aware of this information, they can make changes to improve scheduling and capacity plans.
‚Ä¢ Supporting faster procurement cycles: When a procurement cycle can be graded against a predictive target without human intervention, the overall procurement process becomes much smarter‚Äîand faster. Rather than issuing requests for logistics services one at a time, these cycles can be automated and executed in parallel, effectively enabling enterprise customers to lock in scarce capacity for the right market basket of logistics lanes at once.

One main reason why Amazon is so successful in the middle mile is that it has visibility into all of the cost components that make up port and warehouse operations. Such tight visibility undoubtedly played a role in helping it be first-to-market with Same-Day and 2-Day delivery. Amazon is also deriving savings on middle-mile costs that can ultimately be passed to end customers, furthering its competitive advantage.

For retailers, distributors and other e-commerce players who may not have this luxury, an approach to the procurement of middle-miles logistics that leverages predictive models can offer leverage to control costs in a fast-moving environment.

The prospect of a further rate hike this month offers little sign of a reprieve from those pressures, prompting analysts to forecast some tough results. Adding to the pain is the likelihood that smaller or mid-sized banks will be subject to more stringent regulation amid proposals by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs top banking regulator Michael Barr in the wake of those recent bank failures.

Interest expenses at banks have been rising as they strive to hold onto depositors seeking a greater cut of the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes. Citigroup is increasing what it pays out, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said after the bank reported earnings. At Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, interest expenses climbed a staggering 465% at each of the firms in the second quarter.

And they might not quite be hitting that goal to keep hold of deposits yet, either: Deposits had slipped at Wells Fargo and Citigroup by the end of the second quarter from the end of March. They would have been down at JPMorgan, too, but for its rescue purchase of First Republic Bank in May.

Cleveland-based KeyCorp said in June that its net interest income would probably drop 12% this quarter ‚Äî worse than the 4% to 5% it previously forecast ‚Äî as the lender pays more to hold onto depositors. In its first quarter earnings, the firm said that interest-bearing deposit costs had increased 62 basis points from the prior period.

Zions Bancorp., based in Salt Lake City, Utah, also said its net interest margin will fall this quarter. The figure, which compares how much a bank earns on loans with what it pays depositors, will shrink to about 2.85% from 3.33% in the first three months of 2023, it said in June.

‚ÄúFrom a fundamental perspective, the outlook is challenging,‚Äù Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by Ryan Nash wrote in a note. ‚ÄúDeposits are shrinking, deposit costs continue to rise more than expected, mix shift out of non-interest bearing is likely to continue and asset re-pricing benefits are not enough to offset the pressure.‚Äù

The KBW Regional Banking Index is down about 21% this year, in a first half where short sellers betting against the lenders piled into the sector sparking waves of volatility.

As the turmoil that began with Silvergate Capital Corp. escalated into a crisis of confidence among depositors, many regional banks have been forced to rely on more costly or less sticky sources of funding ‚Äî which in turn harms profitability. For some, these costs didn‚Äôt start rising until late in the quarter, meaning investors are yet to see what the landscape of higher funding costs looks like.

‚ÄúWe expect banks are also using higher cost brokered CDs to supplement organic deposit growth,‚Äù Morgan Stanley analysts led by Gosalia wrote in a note. ‚ÄúWe view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters.‚Äù

An additional headwind to lending activity for some regional banks could come from regulators. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Barr is proposing changes that would require banks to hold more capital to weather economic turbulence.

The changes would also lower the threshold for firms subject to the rules to include banks or bank holding companies with more than $100 billion in assets. Currently, such restrictions only apply to firms that are globally active or have $700 billion or more in assets, Barr said earlier this month.

Another pressure point is regional banks‚Äô exposure to commercial real estate, assets which have been battered by rising interest rates just as the pandemic emptied offices. According to Fitch Ratings, banks with less than $100 billion in assets are more vulnerable to those headwinds, given their higher exposure as a percentage of assets and total capital, the ratings firm wrote in May.

Credit default swap (CDS) prices are less well-known but available in real-time. In simple terms, CDS functions as an insurance policy that investors can purchase that pays off in the event of a borrower‚Äôs default. A higher price of a CDS reflects a more significant probability of default of the borrower. CDS prices for four of the U.S.‚Äôs global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) improved last week and are near their lowest levels since this crisis began. Generally, the view is that the mega banks are safe and might benefit from the deposit flight from and worries about the smaller banks.

A straightforward way to measure the stress in the U.S. banking system is the magnitude of bank support provided by the Federal Reserve via various facilities. The most common is the discount window, which banks generally avoid, but the facility can provide emergency liquidity. In addition, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Federal Reserve announced a new facility to help banks meet withdrawal requests from depositors and restore confidence. The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) allows banks to borrow up the face value of any government bonds held in the bank‚Äôs portfolio at a very reasonable rate. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) facility was created in 2020 to provide support during the pandemic. Other credit is the support of the bridge banks, operated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) until they can be sold or liquidated.

With the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank , discount window and bridge bank credit usage soared. The recent significant shift from discount window borrowing to the bridge bank is related to the failure of First Republic. The credit used by the bridge banks declined as the FDIC made some headway in winding down the failed banks. Overall, the decreased Fed bank lending across its facilities for three weeks in a row evidences some healing. Still, the uptick in BTFP usage illustrates that stresses remain in the system.

Unfortunately, the banking system saw net deposit outflows across large and small banks. Notably, the 25 largest banks, which include many midsize regional banks, have lost about 1.8% of their deposit base since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while the smaller banks lost 4.6%.

Government money market funds saw inflows again last week at a similar pace to the previous week. Cash has been flowing into government money market funds, which confirmed the pressure on deposits to leave the banking system. Notably, the pace of inflows into government money market funds has moderated significantly since the apex of the banking crisis. This movement, also known as ‚Äúcash sorting,‚Äù reflects savers reaching for higher yields while avoiding the credit risk at banks. Cash sorting started before the crisis began but seems likely to continue to some degree while short-term U.S. Treasury yields exceed the interest rates banks pay depositors.

Banks have continued to make loans despite the crisis, but total bank lending declined last week, driven primarily by a decline in business (C&I) loans from the large banks. Loan growth should be expected to slow if banks are forced to hoard extra liquidity to bolster their defenses against possible additional deposit flight and increased loan losses.

The evidence remains inconclusive that any significant loan rationing from the banks is occurring yet, even if it seems a likely outcome of the crisis. So far, all that can be pointed to is a moderation in the pace of increase in bank loans year-over-year, though the deceleration of commercial real estate (CRE) loans is notable. Most commercial real estate loans are provided by smaller banks, which are the ones most threatened by this banking crisis, so that remains an area of concern.

The negotiations to raise the debt ceiling seemed to progress last week, but they broke down on Friday. President Biden‚Äôs absence from Washington to attend the G7 Summit in Japan has likely complicated matters, and negotiations are not expected to begin again until he returns today (Sunday). The good news is that both sides know time is running out, as the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs general account is running low. Since this is a negotiation with each side trying to use its political leverage, these things are usually dragged out until the last minute.

The principal thing to remember is that any debt ceiling crisis is a manufactured political crisis rather than a lack of ability to pay the U.S. government‚Äôs debt. This debt ceiling argument is a political fight in which each side thinks it can extract something from the other. While a possible default on U.S. debt will be discussed in the news if an agreement is not reached as extraordinary measures are exhausted, a default is virtually certain not to happen. Existing law does not stop the U.S. Treasury from prioritizing payments, and according to Strategas, the U.S. has more than enough cash flow to make interest payments. Investors should be prepared for stock and bond volatility, but any significant declines driven by the conflict will likely be an opportunity for long-term investors.

Retailers during the pandemic poured investments into e-commerce, as many questioned whether shoppers would ever return in full force to physical stores. 

CIOs say they could risk losing their customer base to antiquated in-store technology, although cost could be a barrier to making some of these investments.

‚ÄúPhysical locations have lagged behind,‚Äù said Neil Holden, CIO of British retailer Halfords Group PLC, adding that the risk of failing to modernize is that ‚Äúit just doesn‚Äôt appeal to customers.‚Äù

Retailers during the pandemic poured investments into e-commerce, as many questioned whether shoppers would ever return in full force to physical stores.

Two years on, shoppers are returning. E-commerce is now 16.4% of all retail shopping, down from 18.8% at the height of the pandemic, according to the National Retail Federation.

CIOs say they could risk losing their customer base to antiquated in-store technology, although cost could be a barrier to making some of these investments.

‚ÄúPhysical locations have lagged behind,‚Äù said Neil Holden, CIO of British retailer Halfords Group PLC, adding that the risk of failing to modernize is that ‚Äúit just doesn‚Äôt appeal to customers.‚Äù

Tech leaders at companies like Kroger Co. , Nordstrom Inc. and Halfords are considering what new technologies could improve the payment process for customers, offering the type of seamless experience in stores that customers are used to when shopping online.

At Halfords, a provider of automotive and bicycle products and services, Mr. Holden says he is investigating a technology that would allow payments to be sent over sound waves. The cutting-edge technology, which has been used by militaries, involves encoding data into sound waves and then sending it to another device via speaker. Customers would be able to initiate the payment via an app, he said.

Kroger is testing a shopping cart equipped with cameras and sensors that track what a customer is buying so that individual items no longer have to be scanned at checkout, said senior vice president and CIO Yael Cosset.

Mr. Cosset also said he is looking at the possibility of installing checkouts in individual aisles so that if customers want to quickly grab an item they can check out right there.

‚ÄúThere is an opportunity to remove the friction,‚Äù said Mr. Cosset. ‚ÄúIf customers are saying, I would love to be able to pick up a sandwich and walk out with it, then we would create that experience.‚Äù

Dennis Bauer, Nordstrom‚Äôs president of credit, loyalty and payment services, said he has his eye on a nascent technology that would allow payment to be received via a mobile phone rather than a traditional payment terminal.

Near-field communication chips in smartphones are what enable users to tap to pay at the register, but with new technology, they can also be used to accept payments from cards or smartphones, said Nikki Baird, vice president of strategy at retail technology provider Aptos.

Eliminating separate payment hardware could lend greater flexibility and convenience, allowing associates to check customers out wherever they are in the store and busting up long lines, said Mr. Bauer. If retailers have equipped associates with smartphones for tasks like inventory, it would also cut down on the amount of necessary hardware purchases by allowing them to use one device for both duties, he said.

But according to CIOs, a major barrier for any of these investments is cost.

‚ÄúIf you have multiple hundreds or thousands of stores, if you think about the fact that those devices could break,‚Äù said Mr. Bauer about potential smartphone-to-smartphone payment, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a large expense.‚Äù

‚ÄúMargins can be quite tight, therefore investment capital budgets can also be quite tight,‚Äù said Halfords‚Äô Mr. Holden. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never enough.‚Äù

In addition to cost barriers, Mr. Cosset of Kroger said it is also wise to hold back on some investments based on what the consumer actually wants.

Technology exists to provide fully friction-free shopping, where cameras track shoppers around stores and automatically charge them, a phenomenon known as cashierless stores.

Several prominent firms, from social media companies Meta and Twitter to software behemoths Microsoft and Salesforce, have reduced headcounts as elevated consumer demand, which followed the lockdown-induced recession, began to slow. More than 93,000 workers have been dismissed from technology firms so far in 2023, according to a report from Crunchbase, even after companies in the sector nixed some 140,000 positions last year.

DEI employees have seen an elevated degree of attrition relative to their colleagues since late 2020, with the trend accelerating in the last six months, according to an analysis from Revelio Labs. ‚ÄúBearing in mind the typically small size of DEI teams,‚Äù Revelio said, ‚Äúthese outflows likely amount to the exodus of entire diversity teams.‚Äù

More than 300 DEI professionals have left companies such as Amazon, Intel, and Twitter since the middle of last year.

Revelio added that companies with DEI teams tend to be more racially diverse; the dismissal of DEI staffers ‚Äúsignals the value that companies place on making diversity and inclusion a priority for the future.‚Äù

Critics of the DEI movement observe that proponents advocate the mingling of racial or sexual identity with critical hiring decisions, leading to a decline in overall profitability and efficiency as efforts to merely hire the most qualified candidates are deprioritized. Diversity specialists nevertheless earn an average of $84,000 per year in base pay, $11,000 per year in bonuses, and $19,000 per year in stock benefits for expected annual compensation ranging between $90,000 and $148,000, according to an estimate from Glassdoor.

The relief lasted for barely a day. On Tuesday, shares of regional banks were plunging, with a handful of them dropping by double-digit percentages. At one point on Thursday, the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index was down by 15% from the prior week, though it rallied back on Friday to finish the week down 8%.

Why does this matter? Investors, after all, aren‚Äôt depositors. A decline in a bank‚Äôs share price has no immediate effect on its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due. And PacWest and Western Alliance, two regional banks that ended a volatile week down 43% and 27%, respectively, reported no unusual deposit activity following First Republic‚Äôs fire sale.

Economist Benjamin Graham once said that markets can be a weighing machine in the long term, reflecting reality. But in the short term they can be a voting machine, expressing what investors think will happen. And right now, some are voting against regional banks.

What happened to First Republic shows that banks are uniquely vulnerable to an investor vote of no confidence. California‚Äôs banking regulator pointed to First Republic‚Äôs free-falling stock as part of the justification for its decision to close it. The bank, the regulator said, had failed to restore ‚Äúmarket confidence‚Äù in its business model.

This wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen. After the 2008 financial crisis, regulators and lawmakers went to great lengths to make banks safer and less vulnerable to market swings. Banks generally take less risk than they used to on their trading desks and in the kinds of lending they do. They also usually have more capital than regulators say they need: As of the middle of last year, more than 99% of community banks and all regional banks with assets up to $100 billion reported ratios of capital to assets above their requirements, according to the Federal Reserve.

Few questioned the soundness of the banking system until March 8, when Silicon Valley Bank disclosed a loss that called attention to its shaky finances.

Yet the problem caused by rising interest rates in banks‚Äô portfolios‚Äîa central part of this current crisis‚Äîisn‚Äôt a permanent one. Banks‚Äô bonds and loans yielding less than today‚Äôs market rates, which have dropped in value, will eventually mature or pay down. That will give banks fresh money to invest or lend at much higher rates. Jefferies analysts noted that the banks they cover expect to see a roughly 20% to 50% improvement in the paper losses in their securities portfolios by the end of 2024.

And that presumes the Federal Reserve doesn‚Äôt change course in its tightening. Pausing rates for an extended period, or even lowering them, might sharply boost the value of banks‚Äô portfolios. In that way, doing nothing is actually a sensible course of action.

But this optimistic view doesn‚Äôt account for the inherent fragility of deposits. If a bank as established as Silicon Valley Bank or First Republic can face a lethal tidal wave of withdrawals from accounts that lack deposit insurance, it is clear that a bank can very quickly become unsound. Actually selling those securities or loans at discounted prices turns paper losses into real ones, which can quickly deplete a bank‚Äôs capital, forcing regulators to step in.

That is why this type of bank crisis‚Äîa vicious cycle of routs and runs‚Äîcan be so intractable. Three banks have now fallen victim to this dynamic.

Investors do have things to worry about with banks. For one, vehicles such as money-market funds, which compete with banks for cash, are eager to pass on high interest rates to customers. Customers are eager to take them up on the offer, and banks have to offer comparable pricing if they don‚Äôt want to risk losing rate-sensitive depositors.

Smaller lenders are also contending with the perceived solidity of their big-bank peers. The regulatory overhaul in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis mostly focused on the risk of megabank failures, owing to their global interconnectedness. It worked, making them safer and more appealing to depositors. Everyone else, by extension, appears weaker. Out of the nearly $8 trillion in uninsured U.S. deposits at the end of last year, nearly two-thirds resided in seven banks with more than $500 billion in assets, according to figures compiled by Vanderbilt Law School professor Morgan Ricks.

A potential adjustment to capital rules for regional banks might be playing into the market volatility, too. The Wall Street Journal has reported that banks with assets as low as $100 billion might at some point be required to reflect paper losses on certain investments in their regulatory capital levels, something the biggest banks already have to do. Even though those changes could take years to come into effect, analysts might already be marking down banks‚Äô capital levels and anticipating capital raises that dilute current holders and reduce future profitability.

Even without additional capital, most banks could muddle through this crisis with reduced earnings and financial flexibility. But a razor‚Äôs edge existence makes them vulnerable to rapid changes in market or customer sentiment. A move to extend insurance to deposits of more than the $250,000 limit might calm investors‚Äô fears, but this could require a divided Congress to act.

All of which makes this such a difficult crisis to resolve. Some in the market have decided that smaller banks need more capital, but share prices have fallen to levels at which it will be much harder to accomplish.

But a good bank is much more than a mere intermediary: Much of its value resides in the human capital, relationships, and proprietary data and systems developed by the bank that provide both lenders and borrowers more than a generic service.

For instance, the community bank in my central Illinois hometown‚Äîwhere I still do much of my banking despite now living 800 miles away‚Äîhas thrived because its employees intimately know the community and can identify borrowers and projects that are more likely to be successful, therefore being able to pay back their loans. My father, who practiced bankruptcy law in central Illinois until the 2010s, remarked that loans made by community bankers seemed to go south much less frequently than those made by banks with less of a local presence.

The importance of these proprietary assets and other intangible value creators is now in the spotlight, following recent machinations that occurred around the FDIC‚Äôs sale of the insolvent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB ).

After SVB‚Äôs investments in Treasury bonds lost value, triggering a run on deposits, the FDIC stepped in to take over the operation of the bank. The FDIC‚Äôs usual operating plan for a failed bank calls for a quick receivership process that seeks to maximize the value of depositor accounts, the FDIC insurance fund, and the assets for any acquiring bank taking on responsibility for ongoing operations. Accordingly, after a competitive bidding process, First Citizens Bank reached an agreement with the FDIC to acquire most of SVB less than three weeks after the bank went under.

However, according to a lawsuit recently filed by First Citizens, a group of SVB employees had already begun conspiring with another bank, HSBC , to move what they called the ‚Äúcore of [SVB‚Äôs] profitability engine‚Äù to HSBC as their new employer.

First Citizens alleges that this scheme was illegal, as the exodus‚Äìwhich consisted of 42 senior and mid-level employees en masse on April 9th‚Äìwas facilitated by the illegal use of confidential SVB information, including lists of clients, sales strategies, the names and salaries of employees, and other private information. The lawsuit says that HSCB and the former SVB employees unlawfully obtained and then misappropriated SVB‚Äôs confidential, proprietary and trade secret information.

The issue is not that the people who worked for SVB should be compelled to remain: the terms of employment preclude such contracts and California does not allow employees to be bound by non-compete clauses. And, of course, a bank that went under and is taken over by another bank will likely lay off some redundant workers once it begins integrating the new bank, as First Citizens has already done.

However, the litigation does raise an important matter of public policy as it relates to the FDIC receivership process. Naturally, the FDIC should want to ensure that all of the valuable resources of a bank taken over‚Äîincluding the intellectual capital and proprietary assets‚Äîwill remain intact as much as possible, or else it will be difficult to induce healthy banks to bid on future defunct banks. Put simply, a potential buyer needs to have confidence in just what it is buying.

A system that allows illegal raids of the assets of failed banks could lead to catastrophic consequences. At a minimum, it seems certain that the FDIC would receive smaller bids for these banks to account for this uncertainty, resulting in the FDIC needing to raise insurance fees, costing banks‚Äìand their depositors, as well as taxpayers‚Äìmoney. And at worst, it would significantly increase the probability of some banks not being taken over at all due to a lack of viable bidders; this could decimate the FDIC insurance fund, eliminate the value of any uninsured deposits, and leave the communities of defunct banks with one fewer bank that intimately knows its business environment.

Not since the 2008 financial crisis has the global banking system appeared so fragile, as the rapid increase in interest rates used to tackle soaring inflation sends shock waves through the City.

In the turmoil of the past fortnight, the Swiss government-brokered rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has led investors on both sides of the Atlantic to ask the same question: is this 2008 all over again? How bad can it get?

The short answer from banking industry experts is ‚Äúno‚Äù, arguing that problems are limited to a few troubled banks. Major lenders are in a much healthier position than 15 years ago, especially in the UK, after a steady ratcheting up of bank capital and liquidity requirements. This is not the opening scene of the Big Short. SVB is not Northern Rock for the Instagram generation.

The Bank of England reckons the UK system is safe and sound. The biggest lenders have core capital ratios ‚Äì a key measure of financial strength ‚Äì three times higher than before 2008, while annual stress tests suggest banks could weather an economic storm twice as strong as the last big crash.

The longer answer is more worrying. This might not be a carbon copy repeat of the 2008 collapse, but it is not entirely without danger.

Across the City, risk managers are scrambling to look again at the health of the financial firms they do business with. Who might be the next casualty? Are there risks outside of the banks? How will regulators respond?

Given this fear, uncertainty and doubt, bank shares and bonds have sold off sharply, driving up the cost of funding even for supposedly strong and stable lenders. The big worry is that a higher cost of funding for banks will be passed on to households and businesses, should the turbulence lead their risk managers to respond with caution when making new lending decisions.

In other words: a credit crunch is coming.

After the most aggressive tightening cycle for interest rates in decades, higher borrowing costs are beginning to bite hard on the real economy. With an added layer of financial sector instability on top, households and businesses are likely to experience a further increase in the cost of credit.

‚ÄúYou have financial stability issues ‚Äì even if they‚Äôre not really to do with the UK this time. And in general, it will make people more nervous,‚Äù says Alastair Ryan, a banking industry analyst at Bank of America.

‚ÄúIt increases the risk of US recession, and raises the cost of investment through the bond market and through the banks.‚Äù

The situation is most pronounced in the US, where there are concerns over cracks emerging in the $5.6tn (¬£4.6tn) commercial property market. Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, warned last week that banking sector turbulence was ‚Äúlikely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes‚Äù.

A ‚Äúsystemic credit event‚Äù has now replaced inflation as the biggest concern in financial markets, according to Bank of America‚Äôs closely watched monthly survey of fund managers. And with good reason: Goldman Sachs analysts forecast hawkish monetary policy and banking stress could cost the world‚Äôs 10 leading economies about 0.6 percentage points of gross domestic product this year.

In the UK, all of this will badly undermine hopes for a stronger economic future fuelled by a revival in business investment. It‚Äôs a risk the Bank of England is alive to, saying last week it would watch carefully for any spillovers from banking industry stress to household and business borrowing costs.

Britain, after all, enters the looming credit crunch without having ever really recovered from the last. For many, living standards have not advanced much since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Average wages, after taking into account inflation, are no higher today than in 2007.

The UK was a perennial underperformer long before 2008, but has stumbled further behind since ‚Äì exacerbated by the Brexit vote, Covid-19, political infighting and a chop-change approach to policymaking.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve wasted a decade,‚Äù says David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank‚Äôs rate-setting monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crash. He warns that Threadneedle Street will soon be forced to cut rates to avoid a damaging recession.

‚ÄúYou had an opportunity for huge public investment at low rates. Which could‚Äôve had high return, could‚Äôve crowded in private sector investment. But there was none of that. It all falls at the door of the Tories and their failed austerity.‚Äù

The chancellor Jeremy Hunt‚Äôs budget earlier this month included a focus on rebooting business investment, with tax incentives for company spending. At the margin, there were measures that might help. But high borrowing costs and banks taking a tougher approach to lending will push in the opposite direction.

Despite the painful lessons of 2008, Hunt plans to complement his growth plans by rolling back some of the banking sector changes put in place over the past 15 years to prevent another such mess from taking place again. But the ‚ÄúEdinburgh reforms‚Äù could not come at a worse moment.

‚ÄúThere is no real case for financial sector deregulation,‚Äù says Dr Josh Ryan-Collins, an associate professor in economics and finance at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, University College London. He says the priority should be making banks safer, while using the power of the state to direct credit to more productive sectors of the economy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a case of ferocious lobbying by certain interests in the City. And Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak looking for some sort of growth post Brexit. But it‚Äôs not going to work.‚Äù

Instead, an approach to see Britain through the crunch is required.

The COVID-19 outbreak had a negative impact on the global non-alcoholic RTD beverages market as beverage sales and consumption decreased substantially. The travel and trade restrictions imposed amid the pandemic posed as a challenge for businesses operating in this domain. The imposition of stringent nationwide lockdowns and halt of production activities owing to the imposition of social distancing norms hampered market proliferation further.

Surging Demand for Energy Drinks Among Health-Conscious Populace to Aid Market Augmentation

Consumers are increasingly inclined towards health and fitness activities which is elevating the demand for sports and energy drinks. People consume energy drinks as they help in enhancing performance alertness, and endurance. The increasing consumption of energy drinks is thus driving non-alcoholic RTD beverages market growth.

Moreover, several companies operating in the market are offering low-sugar and low-calorie functional energy drinks which will contribute to market augmentation as well. For example, in January 2023, Prime Hydration, LLC., a company offering drink mixes, sports drinks, and energy drinks, introduced a new energy drink named Prime Energy which contains zero sugar and provides 200mg of caffeine per serving.

On the other hand, non-alcoholic RTD beverages have a very high sugar content and are high calorie in nature which will affect their demand negatively and hinder market proliferation.

Asia Pacific held majority of the non-alcoholic RTD beverages market share in 2022 owing rising population and urbanization, growing economic development, and consumer demand for healthy and hygienic products. The region is further witnessing increasing demand for health and wellness drinks. Consumers in the region are demanding functional beverages and foods, owing to their huge interest in holistic well-being which will further propel market expansion.

North America is anticipated to grow significantly in the upcoming years owing to the growing popularity of carbonated drinks in the region. Alcohol consumption in the region has decreased substantially owing to its short-term and long-term health risks. Moreover, the surging demand for low-calorie and no-sugar carbonated beverages led manufacturers to innovate and create different flavors for zero-calorie drinks to attract more consumers which is further attribute to market augmentation.

Europe market is estimated to grow significantly in the upcoming years stoked by surging demand for plant-based food and beverages in the region due to the rising occurrence of lactose intolerance. Leading players are launching innovative beverage options to cater to the growing consumer demands for plant-based options which will further elevate market augmentation.

Tactical developments such as mergers and acquisitions, product launches, partnerships, and collaborations play an essential role in driving market growth and increasing profit margins. They help companies in strengthening their market position and gaining a competitive edge over other players. For instance, in February 2022, PepsiCo Inc. joined forces with Starbucks, an American global chain of coffeehouses, to enter the energy drinks market by launching RTD drink Baya Energy, a carbonated beverage. The joint venture enabled both companies to expand their RTD product portfolio.

These stocks benefited from a rotation into defensive sectors offering stability in an uncertain economy. Rising geopolitical tensions, including the conflict in Ukraine, further fueled interest in the field from both stockholders and the U.S. government. Even with a solid year of gains, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on the sector in 2023, expecting more upside as the U.S. focuses on military spending and geopolitical tensions mount from the likes of Russia and China.

Here are some of the best-performing aerospace and defense stocks of 2022 and what the outlook looks like in the new year. In search of 'defense ballast' to own Northrop Grumman was the best performer in the industry in 2022, rallying nearly 41%. Analysts are mixed on the trajectory for the stock in the new year, with just 50% having a buy or overweight rating, and the consensus price target implying a 3.4% upside from Friday's close. JPMorgan downgraded shares to neutral in October, citing the stock's recent outperformance. Morgan Stanley remains bullish, naming it a top stock pick for 2023, with a $626 price target suggesting nearly 15% upside from Friday's close. ""While the company screens expensive vis-√†vis peers, we see few substitutes for NOC's best-of-breed portfolio and continue to view the stock as the defense ballast to own,"" Liwag said. The top-performing defense stock in the fourth quarter was Boeing , with shares up more than 57%. During the quarter, the aircraft maker announced a new contract with United Airlines to purchase at least 100 Dreamliners . Wall Street expects Boeing's tailwinds to continue, with more than 6 out of 10 analysts rating the stock a buy. The consensus price target implies a 4.3% upside for the stock from Friday's close. Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak also wrote in a note to clients in December that shares should benefit from recovering air travel, orders, and normalizing free cash flows. ""Cash flow has inflected to positive, will accelerate over the coming years, and Boeing has taken an equity raise and near-term new aircraft development off the table ‚Äî which will drive rapid delevering,"" he said. Raytheon Technologies rose more than 17% in 2022, and analysts are optimistic about the stock in 2023. A little over half say the stock is a buy with 6.1% upside from Friday's close. The stock currently sits more than 4% off of its all-time high set in April. Cowen named Raytheon its favorite aftermarket pick positioned to benefit from an uptick in defense spending. Goldman Sachs agreed, saying shares trade inexpensively to its peers. ""We see RTX as the best way to gain exposure to the high-quality aerospace aftermarket as well as higher global defense spend without overweighting either,"" Poponak wrote. Another big name is L3Harris Technologies , with shares down about 2.4% in 2022. It rose 0.2% in the fourth quarter and fell 8.3% in December. More than four in ten analysts rate the stock a buy, with the average price target suggesting 26.2% upside. Citi rates it as neutral, noting concerns over the company's near-term growth.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it has not determined exactly how close a FedEx cargo plane passed over the top of a Southwest Airlines jet last month in Austin, Texas, but there was little margin .

‚ÄúWe still believe the planes were within 100 feet of each other,‚Äù NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in an interview.

An air traffic controller had cleared both planes to use the same runway, the NTSB said in a preliminary report. The FedEx pilots pulled up at the last second to avoid a collision.

The NTSB is also investigating an incident Monday night at Boston‚Äôs Logan International Airport in which a Learjet pilot who was told by an air traffic controller to wait instead began to take off as a JetBlue plane approached to land on an intersecting runway. The JetBlue pilots pulled up, avoiding a collision .

Those and similar incidents in New York, California and Hawaii led the head of the Federal Aviation Administration to call for a ‚Äúsafety summit‚Äù and ignited a debate about whether air safety is declining or the events are just an unusual cluster of serious close calls.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that I can say that it‚Äôs a trend, but these are disturbing because it just takes one,‚Äù Homendy said. ‚ÄúThat is why we investigate incidents ‚Äî so that we can identify problems, especially when we see trends, and address them before they become a full-blown accident.‚Äù

Among the other recent incidents now being investigated:

‚Äî Last week pilots of a small airliner aborted their landing in Burbank, California, after a controller cleared another plane to take off from the same runway ; the NTSB is investigating .

‚Äî A United Airlines jet crossed a runway at Honolulu International Airport in front of a Cessna cargo plane that was landing on the same runway on Jan. 23.

‚Äî The NTSB took the rare step of issuing subpoenas for pilots of an American Airlines plane that crossed a runway that a Delta Air Lines jet was using to take off Jan. 13 at New York‚Äôs John F. Kennedy International Airport. The American pilots initially refused to sit for recorded interviews, but they complied after getting subpoenas, Homendy said.

‚Äî Federal officials are taking another look at an incident in which a United Airlines jet taking off from Hawaii dove to within 800 feet of the ocean before recovering. United says pilots of the December flight are getting additional training.

Except for the United plane that descended sharply after takeoff, the other incidents were ‚Äúrunway incursions‚Äù in which a plane wound up on a runway when it was not supposed to be there. A 2017 forum convened by the NTSB found that the most common causes of runway incursions were pilots ignoring orders from air traffic controllers, or miscommunication between pilots and controllers.

‚ÄúRunway incursions have always been an area of concern, but it looks worse because the system is so safe,‚Äù said John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ‚ÄúWe fortunately don‚Äôt have many accidents, so we focus on these risk precursors.‚Äù

Pilots are the last line of defense in aviation safety. In some of the recent incidents -- notably the one in Austin -- pilots spotted something wrong and reacted quickly.

The incidents may put an end to any possibility of easing experience requirements for newly hired pilots, which is something that smaller, regional airlines have requested to help them cope with a pilot shortage. President Joe Biden‚Äôs nominee for the top job at the Federal Aviation Administration, Phillip Washington, said Wednesday that he opposes easing the pilot-qualification standards.

Besides the close calls, there have also been several recent incidents involving severe turbulence causing injuries on planes. In the most recent case, a Lufthansa plane flying from Austin to Germany diverted to Washington Dulles International Airport on Wednesday night; seven people on board were hurt badly enough to go to hospitals. The FAA said it is investigating.

The close calls have attracted the attention of lawmakers, who questioned the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration about them during recent hearings. The official, Billy Nolen, defended the safety of the nation‚Äôs air-travel system last month while acknowledging the need for vigilance.

‚ÄúWe are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we do not take that for granted,‚Äù Nolen told a Senate committee. ‚ÄúRecent events remind us that we cannot become complacent.‚Äù

Nolen, like executives of the airline industry, point out that there has not been a fatal crash involving a U.S. airline plane since 2009, an unprecedented stretch.

Still, he said at the hearing and in an internal memo, he was forming a ‚Äúsafety review team‚Äù to examine the aviation system, starting with a meeting in March ‚Äúto examine what additional actions the aviation community needs to take to maintain our safety record.‚Äù Nolen said aviation leaders will look into which steps are working ‚Äúand why others appear to be not as effective as they once were.‚Äù

The FAA did not immediately respond when asked questions about the summit and new safety review team.","Close call, turbulent flight add to aviation safety concerns",non-causal,"NTSB, FAA","['FAA', 'NTSB']",[],"['FAA', 'NTSB']","['FAA', 'AAL', 'NTSB']",-0.994796

The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday ran a feature about semiconductors, soaring inventories, and weak demand. Investors then sold chip stocks across the board. Easy narratives drive stock prices, regardless of facts.

It‚Äôs a lesson, and an opportunity for investors.

Let‚Äôs be clear, some semiconductor markets are in a glut.

We know this because executives from the companies that are the biggest players in those markets have told us. Sanjay Mehrotra, chief executive at Micron Technology (MU) says that computer memory inventory at the Lehi, Utah-based company is well above internal targets. That‚Äôs code for too much stock, and forced price cuts. In the interim, Micron is also cutting 10% of its workforce to smooth out the short term hit to profitability.

Then there is Intel Corp. (INTC), the world‚Äôs largest maker of central processing units, the brains of most PCs and data center servers. Intel has been a bad business for so long it is hard to remember when executives were on the right side of industry trends. Forbes reports that nothing has changed.

Micron and Intel are big suppliers to the largest personal computer markets. The companies supply Hewlett Packard (HPQ), Dell Technologies (DELL) and the rest of the industry that is not Apple (AAPL). Business has been bad since late 2021 when businesses and consumers stopped upgrading their computers to get online. And there lies the larger problem for investors in chip businesses.

The upgrade cycle coming out of the pandemic was real, yet short-lived.

The lockdown forced companies to upgrade laptops, and enterprise software suites. A lot of those sales were pulled forward, out of the normal capital expenditure cycle. Sales that would have occurred in 2022 became redundant. Add a slowing global economy, due to higher interest rates, layoffs and general worry and you get weaker consumer demand, too. These factors are causing a glut of chips, for PCs, smartphones, and other categories impacted by the pandemic pull forward.

That is a substantial part of the semiconductor business, however, it is not all of the sector. The world is not really awash in chips. There are too many of the chips that have become commoditized over time.

Some parts of the sector, like specialized graphics processing units for cutting edge datacenters, next generation silicon for electric vehicles, power stations and EV charging infrastructure are experiencing high demand. Companies like On Semiconductor (ON) have sold out production years in advance.

And the Journal notes that executives at Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC), a supplier to the defense industry and data centers, are not concerned with rising inventories given the nature of its customers.

Despite this, both On Semiconductor and Lattice were hit hard Tuesday in the fallout from the WSJ semiconductor story. The stocks declined 1.7%, and 3.5% respectively.

And that is the lesson for investors: Big narratives drive stock prices, even when the storyline is fundamentally flawed. Smart investors wait for the fallout, look for support levels, then invest wisely.

There is one other factor for semiconductor investors to keep in mind.

The stock prices typically begin moving higher as executives guide analysts‚Äô expectations about future inventories.

Colette Kress, chief financial offer at Nvidia told analysts in November that inventory levels could normalize by the end of January. Nvidia shares responded by rising from $139 to $187.70 during the next six weeks, a gain of 35%.

Overall, semiconductor sales are projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, according to a research reports from Gartner , and McKinsey. The only weak spot was PCs. Researchers at Gartner expect a modest 5.4% decline for PC sales in 2023.

The bottom line is that the current narrative about the semiconductor glut is an opportunity. Investors should look for attractive entry levels for their favorite businesses in the sector. The sector is not a monolith, and it is not in decline.

The banking group is worried about a chain reaction and more flight by depositors should another bank fail. ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the overall health and safety of the banking industry, confidence has been eroded in all but the largest banks,‚Äù the group said in the letter. ‚ÄúConfidence in our banking system as a whole must be immediately restored.‚Äù The bank group proposes that banks pay for the expanded insurance program by increasing the FDIC assessment on banks that want the increased coverage.

U.S. regulators have tried to calm fears over threats to banking systems. The Federal Reserve said cash-short banks had borrowed about $300 billion in the week up to Thursday.

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has been providing banking services to technology startups, VCs and even ‚Äúbig brands‚Äù for decades.

Jack Milligan provides some context (the bold italics are mine):

‚ÄúAs the largest financial institution in the VC market ‚Äì and one that focuses on it exclusively ‚Äì SVB has benefited enormously from the surge in venture funding. But the bank‚Äôs advantage goes well beyond just being in the right place at the right time. The innovation economy has its own ecosystem made up of serial entrepreneurs, startup companies, investors, advisors and other lenders.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe biggest risk to SVB‚Äôs profitability is probably an economic slump that puts a damper on investor enthusiasm. ‚ÄòIf you see a change around investor appetite to invest in startups and companies tied to the innovation economy, that could slow things down in terms of growth of the business, at least temporarily,‚Äô says Ebrahim Poonawala, who heads up North American bank research at Bank of America Securities.‚Äù

NPR‚Äôs Bobby Allyn‚Äôs described the threat of innovation as ‚Äúan 'existential risk' to innovation and competition in America.‚Äù Worse, much worse: ‚Äúeventually, Silicon Valley Bank would come to do business with nearly half of all U.S. tech startups backed by venture capitalists ‚Ä¶ (which) can be an existential risk to competition and innovation in the American economy for the next decade.""

Why is the innovation financial infrastructure so weak? Why do half of US start-ups rely upon one bank? Does anyone see this as ‚Äúunusual‚Äù or unusually risky? Does anyone see this as a way to win the global innovation war?

‚ÄúMany startup founders on Friday signed up for new loans based on the future revenues of their companies, according to Nathan Latka, CEO of Founderpath, a startup that offers this type of financing. Others heard from their VC backers, who said they could provide short-term cash. Menlo Ventures is planning on offering loans to portfolio companies that need to make payroll, Matt Murphy, a partner at the firm, said. Murphy said other large venture firms have committed to or are planning on doing the same.

‚ÄúAnd in some cases, founders sought to stanch their own personal losses. Omeed Malik, founder and CEO of Farvahar Partners, an investment bank that specializes in secondary share sales, said that founders were calling all day on Friday trying to sell their shares to shore up personal cash positions amid a growing worry about their business prospects.‚Äù

Is this how it‚Äôs done?

Innovation is the real loser here.

Is innovation actually managed in one small town (the bold italics are mine)?

‚ÄúThis kind of gets us to one of SVB‚Äôs key problems: Silicon Valley is actually a small town. And while that meant SVB was the cool banker for the tech and life sciences startups here, that also meant its portfolio wasn‚Äôt very diverse. The incestuous nature of Silicon Valley startups means gossip is a contact sport, because everyone here is hopelessly entwined with everyone else.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf SVB, which for 40 years has been a pillar of the startup ecosystem, can disappear in 36 hours, what else is going to drop?,‚Äù said Rick Heitzmann, the founder of VC firm FirstMark Capital.‚Äù

‚ÄúGarry Tan, president and chief executive of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator in Silicon Valley, said many of its roughly 3,000 active companies had a relationship with Silicon Valley Bank. YC surveyed those companies Friday morning and by Friday afternoon, nearly 400 had said they had exposure and over 100 said they worried they couldn‚Äôt make payroll over the next 30 days without a quick resolution for the bank.‚Äù

Clearly the innovation infrastructure must be expanded way beyond the small town of Silicon Valley. The big banks who are now the darlings of the SVB mess need to play much larger roles in the innovation infrastructure. Terms? Obviously, they need to modify. Hedge fund buyouts at 60 cents on the dollar is not the answer. Personal loans from wealthy VCs is also not the answer.

There are always the usual funding suspects:

But all of these are subject to swings in the economy. Today, for example, is not a good time to swing.

If the SVB debacle has taught us anything it‚Äôs that a concentration of financial innovation management in one institution (or one geographic location) is dangerous, risky and, frankly, stupid. There‚Äôs time enough to ask questions about how all this happened and why no one saw it coming (which is arguably not actually the case). There‚Äôs time to ask who made the most money from SVB‚Äôs failure ‚Äì and how they made it. There will be legitimate and silly debates about how the SVB failure was handled. Finger pointing aside, what‚Äôs the real, long-term answer? Is there a meaningful lesson here?

The call here is for an expanded national innovation infrastructure. Here‚Äôs where the US was in 2020:
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe U.S. national innovation system is in crisis, and in need of thorough rejuvenation, especially through significant increases in federal funding.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúA strong national innovation system requires correctly structuring all three sides of the ‚Äúinnovation success triangle‚Äù ‚Äì the business environment, the regulatory environment, and the innovation policy environment.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhile under threat, the United States still has reasonably good business and regulatory environments, but it has a weak innovation policy environment.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCompared to other nations, the United States is trending downward in its funding for universities, federal labs, and other innovation inputs that policymakers have been unwilling to prioritize in the federal budget process.‚Äù

What does this have to do with the failure of SVB? A strong national innovation infrastructure would significantly reduce pressure on the usual suspects ‚Äì including VCs and banks. It would fuel innovation everywhere and across sectors. (Today‚Äôs funding/banking oligarchy should be challenged. Replacing SVB with another go-bank is not the answer.) While some progress has been made, there‚Äôs much more to do. Funding and banking are intertwined: what if both were more widely available and more professionally managed?

The argument here is that ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù is not a local problem. It‚Äôs seductive to focus on SVB and other banks that might fail the start-up community. It‚Äôs solid click-bait. But the real challenge is not to fix start-up banks, but to make innovation a real, sustained national priority.

BlackRock has faced criticism over the firm‚Äôs support of the environmental, social, and corporate governance movement, also known as ESG. Skeptics of the movement contend that the philosophy intermixes political and social causes favored by executives, such as diversifying company leadership with respect to race or sex, in a manner that compromises or distracts from profitability.

The complaint against BlackRock from America First Legal comes one day after the group submitted a similar filing against Anheuser-Busch, the company which controls Bud Light.

With more than half of U.S. corn and soybean acreage facing drought conditions, some farmers are calculating whether insurance payments will cover the cost of the crops they have sown this year.

As of June 27, 65% of the Midwest was in a moderate drought or worse, the broadest area in a decade, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said 70% of the country‚Äôs corn production area and 63% of soybeans were affected by drought. The five-year average for U.S. corn in drought before this year is 18%, according to federal data, and 15% for soybeans.

In Coal Valley, Ill., where Megan Dwyer‚Äôs family raises corn, soybeans and beef cattle on 700 acres, the fate of the farm‚Äôs year depends on how much rain falls over the next few weeks.

‚ÄúWith the drought, we might not even have a crop to sell this year,‚Äù said Dwyer, a fourth-generation farmer, at The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Global Food Forum event in late June.

Around a third of winter wheat grown in the U.S. is expected to be abandoned, according to federal data, because the poor quality isn‚Äôt worth the cost to harvest it this year. That would represent the highest rate of abandonment since 1917.

Some livestock producers and meat companies are bracing for higher feed bills that could follow a smaller-than-expected harvest.

Farmers whose fields remain green, however, are set to pad their incomes. Farmers outside of drought territory could get another year of solid income just as corn prices were on the decline, said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

‚ÄúMy grandmother always told me to pray for drought in Illinois,‚Äù said Irwin, who comes from a family of Iowa farmers.

Higher prices for crops also improve prospects for global crop shippers such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge as concerns over supplies prompt grain buyers to make advance purchases.

ADM is estimated to earn more than $3.7 billion in profit in its 2023 fiscal year, while Bunge is expected to make $1.8 billion for the year, according to FactSet. ADM and Bunge had no comment.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see weather volatility getting any better,‚Äù said Bunge Chief Financial Officer John Neppl at a May investor conference. ‚ÄúWhen you have a global platform like we do and you have all the origin-destination combinations that we can put together, that really bodes well for a business like ours.‚Äù

Wheat futures were up about 10% in June. Corn and soybean futures, which had traded higher as drought spread, have fallen in recent days as traders responded to wetter forecasts in the Midwest and expanded corn acres detailed in a USDA report.

How the weather ultimately impacts farmers‚Äô harvests this fall could hinge on the next few weeks, analysts and farmers said.

Farmers‚Äô drought math can have mixed implications for companies such as Corteva, Bayer, Deere and CNH Industrial, which sell farmers seeds, pesticides and machinery.

While higher crop prices can mean more money for farmers to invest in their next growing season, analysts said, if the drought decimates too much U.S. farmland and farm income, farm suppliers will suffer as growers transition to cheaper generic seed purchases or put off equipment purchases.

Corteva said its success depends on farmers succeeding, and droughts can impact their productivity. The company is developing more drought-tolerant corn, a spokesman said. Bayer, Deere and CNH had no comment.

Dry conditions bring new pests and diseases that require additional farm chemical purchases. Joe Sinclair, president of the farm retailer Quality Ag Services in Iowa, said insecticides sales will be on the rise this year as the dry weather brings pests like two-spotted spider mites into farmers‚Äô fields.

Higher grain costs from drought make it more expensive to feed cattle, hogs and chickens.

Many hog farmers are struggling to make a profit, and cattle ranchers have been shrinking their herds over the past year as their feed bills go up.

Dairy producers will need to decide whether to shrink their operations or eat the higher feed costs until the market moves back in their favor, said industry officials. Ethanol producers paying higher prices for corn could be faced with the decision of whether to keep their plants running at lower profit margins or to cut production, executives and analysts said.

For farmers with drought-withered fields, crop insurance can help growers come close to break-even and defend against bankruptcy, said Matt Bennett, an Illinois farmer and co-founder of brokerage and consulting firm AgMarket. Net. But farmers will still struggle to cover costs for fertilizer, fuel, seeds and other expenses.

The divestments, constituting a drop in the bucket in comparison to the nearly $8 trillion managed by BlackRock, occur as market forces react against the investment philosophy, which argues that firms have a responsibility beyond maximizing profits for shareholders with respect to their environmental, social, and corporate governance commitments.

Divestments began in January when West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore announced the state would no longer use BlackRock to manage roughly $8 billion in operating funds due to the company‚Äôs advocacy of net zero investment strategies, which discourage investments in the fossil fuel industry despite strong returns the sector has returned throughout the year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost along the lines of a religious fervor, where they‚Äôre willing to take a loss to further their political ideology,‚Äù Moore commented in an interview last month with The Daily Wire. ‚ÄúThey need to be maximizing returns for their beneficiaries.‚Äù

The action was followed in March with a $125 million divestment from the state of Arkansas, as well as a $100 million divestment in September from the state of Utah. The month of October saw a $794 million divestment from Louisiana, a $200 million divestment from South Carolina, and a $500 million divestment from Missouri. Florida likewise removed $2 billion from the company earlier this month, asserting that the mission to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù promoted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink exposes the state‚Äôs resources to significant financial risks.

Among other issues, officials in the conservative-leaning states expressed concern that the ESG movement may present obstacles to state pension funds and other entities seeking access to capital markets as ratings agencies downgrade bond ratings linked to cultural matters unrelated to financial health. ESG activists have pushed stockholders for companies such as Walmart and Lowe‚Äôs to consider abortion-related proposals ahead of the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

‚ÄúThose decisions really have nothing to do with the underlying credit quality of a state government or of a corporation that is operating in that state,‚Äù Missouri State Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick said during an interview with The Daily Wire earlier this year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to drive up the cost for taxpayers in states that don‚Äôt subscribe to this ideology.‚Äù

Critics of the ESG movement say that the philosophy mingles political causes in a manner that exposes investors to risks. ESG investments have suffered over the past year as languishing technology stocks, which rank highly in ESG ratings due to the underlying companies‚Äô involvement in social issues, fall behind outsized profitability from energy stocks, which rank poorly due to worries regarding carbon emissions.

As the debate over the ESG movement continues to make national headlines, Fink announced last month that institutional clients would be permitted to vote their own shares rather than allow the company to act as a proxy, offering a measure of freedom to investors who desire to recuse themselves from ESG efforts. BlackRock has taken ‚Äúvoting action on climate issues‚Äù against dozens of portfolio companies, according to a stewardship report published two years ago.

Indeed, an exclusive poll from The Daily Wire conducted in May showed that 64% of respondents believe the ‚Äúindividual investors whose savings are being invested‚Äù should decide whether retirement and pension funds are allocated according to ESG standards, while a mere 20% believe that ‚ÄúWall Street asset managers‚Äù should make such decisions.

How could this happen to an airline that was ranked #1 by JD Power in overall customer satisfaction for economy flights as recently as May 2022?

The answer is not that its leaders are shameless hacks or even that they were unlucky victims of a perfect storm. Rather, it is because US airlines have the same problem that industries from semiconductors to baby formula saw laid bare over the last two years.

It is too lean.

So Many Root Causes

What went wrong? First was obviously the mega-storm hitting North America with biblical snow and cold at a time of peak demand for air travel. As anyone who flies knows, it doesn‚Äôt take much bad weather to cause delays which cascade through the system. Delays beget other delays because crews and equipment are suddenly short, which means planes can‚Äôt fly even if the bad weather is past.

Plus, it‚Äôs worse when the passengers are mostly inexperienced, overloaded families rather than carry-on-only road warriors. Rebooking takes longer because novice customers with lots of stuff are harder to resolve, especially when there are fewer flights to choose from for rebooking. This is a classic vicious spiral, but not exactly an unfamiliar one.

For Southwest two other failures magnified the misery. Tech was the first. The scheduling system used for assigning crews to flights couldn‚Äôt handle the pace and volume and crashed. Manual scheduling was the fall back, but since it is slow and error prone (think spreadsheets), every time a new hiccup hit, the whole thing had to be redone. A system‚Äôs inability to handle thousands of ‚Äòwhat-if‚Äô planning questions, especially in safety-oriented, highly regulated operation like commercial airlines, is deadly.

The second Southwest specific failure was its point-to-point operating model which fares worse in a crisis than the hub-and-spoke model used by American, United and Delta. This is because hub-and-spoke offers much more flexibility when flight cancellations require operations teams to find replacement planes or pilots for stranded passengers.

Too Clever, Too Lean, Too Bad

Southwest‚Äôs bad week is not proof of incompetence. It is proof that we all still expect too much of the ultra-lean, cost-obsessed principles that got us in trouble when ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù became the go-to excuse for everything that failed last year.

Look at it through a supply chain management lens and the failures make sense:

Inventory ‚Äì This is how supply chain people buffer against uncertainty. Inventory gets you through problems with missed deliveries or surprise demand upsides. In commercial air travel passenger wait time is the ‚Äúinventory‚Äù that operations managers use to buffer uncertainty. When things get crazy, customer wait time goes way up. It‚Äôs a cash-smart way to handle volatility, but it sucks for customers.

Capacity utilization ‚Äì Southwest‚Äôs point-to-point system is a feature, not a bug. They famously use quick turnarounds to minimize aircraft idle time, which is good for profitability and even good for customers, so long as the flights stay on schedule. When things don‚Äôt go as planned capacity (planes and crews) are suddenly out of place, so fixes take much longer. Southwest could keep the feature but limit the risk of cancellations with more aircraft and lower capacity utilization.

Sales & Operations Planning ‚Äì This is how supply chain managers scramble to match supply and demand. For years planners have gotten by with rather slow manual forecasting and production planning processes because things were reasonably smooth. When volatility goes off the charts however S&OP breaks down. Southwest‚Äôs scheduling failure shows how much trouble comes from planning systems that aren‚Äôt using the latest technology to handle huge, complex planning challenges.

Resilience became the buzz word in supply chain management in 2022 because people learned to appreciate reliability more than ever. But resilience costs money. If we as consumers want to avoid a repeat of this snafu, we should prepare to pay more so airlines can upgrade their tech, add capacity to fleets, airports, and staffing, and find better ways to manage ‚Äúinventory‚Äù that don‚Äôt include a lottery of doom where losers end up sleeping on an airport floor.",Southwest Airlines Meltdown: A Supply Chain Management ...,non-causal,"JD, US, OP",[],[],"['OP', 'JD', 'US']","['OP', 'LUV', 'JD', 'US']",0.99624825

‚Äî Proactively let state emergency response teams know when they are transporting tank cars with hazardous gases through their states;

‚Äî Join FRA‚Äôs whistleblower protection program, which many smaller railroads and passenger railroads participate in but which the major freights do not;

‚Äî Deploy automated track inspection technology without asking to get rid of human inspectors;

‚Äî Move up the phase-in of safer, more durable tank cars that railroads had lobbied to delay until 2029, currently slated for 2025; and

‚Äî Provide workers paid sick leave, the unfinished business of the resolution of the strike threat last year.

What DOT wants from Congress: DOT called on Congress to increase maximum fines for rail safety violations from the current $225,455 cap, which the agency called ‚Äúa rounding error‚Äù for profitable companies.

In a letter Sunday to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw, Pete Buttigieg noted the railroad‚Äôs ‚Äúexceptionally profitable business,‚Äù running a 38 percent operating margin and issuing $18 billion in stock buybacks and dividends over the last five years ‚Äî ‚Äúreportedly twice as much as the amount Norfolk Southern invested in its railways and operations.‚Äù","DOT pledges new actions on hazardous trains, asks Congress and industry to also take steps",non-causal,"FRA, CEO, DOT","['CEO', 'DOT']",['DOT'],"['CEO', 'FRA', 'DOT']","['FRA', 'CEO', 'NSC', 'DOT']",-0.9980065

Billions of dollars in venture capital flow into and out of the bank's coffers.

But the 40-year-old firm's intimate ties to technology leave it particularly sensitive to the industry's boom-and-bust cycles, and on Thursday those risks became abundantly clear.

SVB was forced into a fire sale of its securities, unloading $21 billion worth its holdings at a $1.8 billion loss, while also raising $500 million from venture firm General Atlantic, according to a financial update late Wednesday. After its stock soared 75% in the 2021 market rally, SVB lost two-thirds of its value last year and then plummeted another 60% during regular trading on Thursday.

For the Silicon Valley region, the troubles land at a particularly difficult time. Venture capital deal activity sank over 30% last year to $238 billion, according to PitchBook. While that's still a historically high number, the dearth of IPOs and continuing drawdown in valuations among once highfliers suggests that there's much more pain to come in 2023.

As a large regulated bank, SVB has been viewed as a stabilizing force. But its latest financial maneuvers are raising alarm bells among the firm's client base.

""Psychologically it's a blow because everyone realizes how fragile things can be,"" said Scott Orn, operating chief at Kruze Consulting, which helps startups with tax, accounting and HR services.

Orn called SVB a ""crown jewel of Silicon Valley"" and a ""strong franchise"" that he expects to survive this difficult period and even potentially get acquired by a bigger bank. For his customers, which number in the hundreds, a pullback by SVB would likely make it more expensive to borrow money.

""Losing a major debt provider in the venture debt market could drive the cost of funds up,"" Orn said.

According to SVB's mid-quarter update, one of the primary problems the bank faces has to do with the amount of money its customers are spending. Total client funds have fallen for the last five quarters, as cash burn has continued at a rapid pace despite the slowdown in venture investing.

""Client cash burn remains ~2x higher than pre-2021 levels and has not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment,"" SVB said.

In January, SVB expected average deposits for the first quarter to be $171 billion to $175 billion. That forecast is now down to $167 billion to $169 billion. SVB anticipates clients will continue to burn cash at essentially the same level as they did in the last quarter of 2022, when economic tightening was already well underway.

Analysts at DA Davidson wrote in a report on Thursday that in terms of spending, ""companies have not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment."" The firm has a neutral rating on the stock and said concerns ""over a slow to recover VC environment have kept us cautious on SIVB shares.""

S&P lowered its rating on SVB to BBB- from BBB, leaving it just one notch above its junk rating. On Wednesday, Moody's reduced SVB to Baa1 from A3, reflecting ""the deterioration in the bank's funding, liquidity and profitability, which prompted SVB to announce actions to restructure its balance sheet.""

Concern has quickly turned to the potential contagion effect. Does the bank's acknowledged misfortunes lead clients to pull their money and house it elsewhere? That question was circling among investors and tech execs on Thursday, even after CEO Greg Becker wrote in a letter to shareholders that, the bank has ""ample liquidity and flexibility to manage our liquidity position.""

""More in the VC community need to speak out publicly to quell the panic about @SVB_Financial,"" Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures wrote on Twitter. ""I believe their CEO when he says they are solvent and not in violation of any banking ratios & goal was to raise & strengthen balance sheet.""

Suster funds the kinds of risk-taking and future-oriented ventures that rely on SVB for banking services.

In the case studies section of the firm's website, for example, SVB highlights a loan to solar panel provider Sunrun , debt offerings to autonomous construction equipment vendor Built Robotics and financing solutions for ocean drone startup Saildrone.

SVB's loan losses remain low, meaning that at least for now it's not facing the kind of credit challenges the bank dealt with during the dot-com crash and financial crisis, when charge-offs soared.

Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, but with an active Arlington office for years, was the rare bank known to cater to startup and tech investments, in particular ‚Äî an issue when a string of tech companies looking to cut costs and regain footing in this economic environment created a rush for deposits all at once earlier this month, essentially squeezing the bank dry.

It closes one door to potential capital for startups like Nevly, a D.C. fintech whose software helps lower-income residents and underserved communities boost their credit scores. Nevly CEO Eric Blue, who just raised pre-seed funding, said he recently spoke with a Silicon Valley Bank regional representative about what they could offer that conventional banks didn't ‚Äî and had planned to open an account with the institution.

""The startup community, VC and their portfolio companies will continue to have to adjust to the new reality,‚Äù Blue said this week. ‚ÄúCapital is no longer free.""

Local startup leaders and backers said in the near term, there should be less impact. The Biden administration hurried to insure deposits beyond the $250,000 cap to help contain the pain, but bankers and investors alike say the long-term effect of that action is still unclear.

They understood the needs of their customer base in a way I think larger, more diversified banks may not. I hope they find a buyer or another player emerges to fill the niche.""

This comes at a bad time for young entrants to market, when fears of a recession or market correction had already been looming this year. At Halcyon, which invests in early-stage companies, the message was more about mitigating risk, ‚Äúincluding scenario modeling and contingency planning,‚Äù said CEO Kate Goodall and Chief Investment Officer Dahna Goldstein in a joint statement to the Washington Business Journal.

‚ÄúThere is a lot of very understandable anxiety,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúA handful of our portfolio companies were affected, so like everyone else, we experienced the full roller coaster of emotions through the weekend. These are the most important moments for investors to be a calm and moderating force, so we concentrated on communicating relevant and helpful information to our entrepreneurs and LPs, instead of the things that were beyond our control.‚Äù

VentureScope, a Tysons consulting and venture investment firm, had at least one portfolio company‚Äôs founders calling in tears, not sure how they were going to make payroll because their money was frozen with SVB. The venture firm, which is part of the Global Accelerator Network, said some of the resources being pushed out to startups over the weekend included suicide hotlines for panicked founders.

‚ÄúIt's traumatic to the extent that startup organizations were rallying behind their founders. It wasn't just: How can we help you make payroll? It was also: We're there for you, if you need to talk to someone,‚Äù said Jason Chen, VentureScope's founder and CEO. ‚ÄúIt was good to see the startup world recognize that this isn't just a dollar issue or money issue. It's also a personal well-being and an emotional issue.‚Äù

Experts expect lasting effects, particularly for the fintech sector whose focus is often to help customers pay bills or manage finances. Given how many fintechs partner with banks of all sizes, risk management will likely need to be a new priority, said Ben Britt, managing partner of Alexandria‚Äôs Route 66 Ventures.

‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs going to probably start rethinking some of those things, about how you can make the system more resilient and less exposed to a single point of failure,‚Äù he said.

The key question, in the meantime, is who will now fill the gap that Silicon Valley Bank left in lending to younger, riskier enterprises looking to be the next Meta or Google. Locally, SVB was a frequent purveyor of the Small Business Administration‚Äôs Paycheck Protection Program loans, especially to often-riskier biotech and life sciences bets, and it backed companies like WageStream and ThreatQuotient, an Ashburn data security company that said it hit growth records last year.

Since the bank failures, customers of regional banks have been moving their money to larger banks seen as too big to fail.

For one, dealers may be underestimating how much talk of a possible U.S. recession is rattling consumers, says Sanjiv Yajnik, President of Financial Services at Capital One.

For another, most dealers report that the purchasing process is ‚Äúvery or completely transparent,‚Äù while only around 1-in-5 consumers agree.

‚ÄúAs dealers approach 2023, dealers in general are feeling like it is going to be a great year,‚Äù Yajnik says in a phone interview.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve just come off a great year, in 2022, and in 2021. Inventory is limited. Profitability is the best they‚Äôve had in many, many, many years. Looking at 2023, dealers are feeling like it‚Äôs going to be great year,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúThe customer, on the other hand, is not feeling that great,‚Äù Yajnik says.

According to an annual survey of both consumers and auto dealers, 84% of the dealer respondents say it‚Äôs ‚Äúa good time to buy a car.‚Äù Only 33% of the consumers say the same, and 47% say it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a good‚Äù time.

Respondents included more than 2,000 consumers who recently bought or were considering buying a car. Around 400 U.S. dealers responded to the survey, Capital One said. The survey was fielded in October 2022.

Like the question of whether it‚Äôs a good time to buy, dealers and consumers split over how transparent the purchase process is. Among dealers, 68% said the car buying process is ‚Äúvery or completely transparent,‚Äù vs. 21% of the consumers.

A big part of the problem is most online, third-party payment estimators are inaccurate, Yajnik says, so customers come into a dealership with unrealistic expectations of what they can afford.

Accurate e-commerce tools are a potential solution, Yajnik says. Capital One is an early mover in online commerce for auto finance, a business that has been slow to adopt e-commerce, compared with other retail industries. The bank says its so-called Navigator Platform produces ‚Äúpenny-perfect‚Äù monthly payment estimates.

In a webinar sponsored by Capital One, dealer Drew Tutton said customers lose faith in a dealership when they‚Äôre quoted a different payment than they expected.

Tutton is a managing partner of Voyles Automotive in Metro Atlanta, which has four dealerships, and owner and president of Tutton Group, consisting Tutton Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram, plus three recreational vehicle dealerships.

‚ÄúWe would estimate what the payment would be. The customer would estimate, based on their credit score. That created a lot of non-transparency.

A run on certain banks has translated into a run into others. After all, the money has to be kept somewhere‚Äîand unlike during the global financial crisis of 15 years ago, when big banks were loaded up with toxic subprime-mortgage-related securities‚Äîthis time they are in much better shape.

This, along with the widespread view that certain globally systemically important banks are ‚Äútoo big to fail,‚Äù has made them natural destinations for the money exiting regional banks.

In the days following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported that Bank of America picked up $15 billion of new deposits. Other banking giants like J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also collected a large number of new deposits at the expense of smaller regional banks.

More deposits mean cheaper funding for the banks. It also means more customers to whom the banks can offer other services. That‚Äôs the good news.

The bad news is that the regional banking crisis increases the risk of an economic downturn, which is obviously bad news for all banks, big and small. It might also lead to increased scrutiny and regulations for the industry as a whole, something that could weigh on banks‚Äô profitability.

It‚Äôs because of these concerns that the big banks have been dragged down this month. The four aforementioned big banks are down anywhere from 10% to 20% so far this month, though that‚Äôs still better than the 26% decline for the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) in the same period.

Some investors might look at big banks‚Äô growing deposits and lower stock prices and see an opportunity.

Their fundamentals haven‚Äôt deteriorated to nearly the extent of regional banks (and in some ways, they‚Äôve improved), yet their stocks have fallen in sympathy.

If that‚Äôs your thesis, then the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWB) might look interesting. The $1.4 billion ETF provides broad exposure to the banking industry. Its portfolio includes both national banks and regional banks, but because it‚Äôs market cap weighted, the big banks dominate.

J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo make up a combined 36% of the portfolio.

Another option for investors seeking exposure to the big banks is a broad financials ETF, like the Financial Select Sector SDPR Fund (XLF).

The ETF has 21% of its portfolio allocated to J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Incidentally, the fund‚Äôs top holding, Berkshire Hathaway, also owns Bank of America. It‚Äôs the second-largest holding of Warren Buffett‚Äôs company, with an 11% weighting.

The report on Monday shows requirements for receiving a loan have become more difficult for commercial and industrial loans. Families will also face challenges and higher costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit and credit cards.

The loan officers anticipate problems to continue into 2024. The survey cites concerns about diminished expectations for economic growth, changes in lending standards, terms and business and household demand for loans, concerns over deposit outflows and reduced risk tolerance.

The SLOOS is a quarterly survey conducted by the Fed that collects data about bank lending practices and credit conditions to gauge a pulse on the economy. The survey is a leading indicator of how bank credit will likely change and offers insights into the economy‚Äôs future direction, which can inform monetary policy decisions.

‚ÄúThere has been an ongoing tightening of lending conditions. And that is part of the process by which monetary policy works,‚Äù United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC. ‚ÄúThe Fed is aware that tightening of credit conditions is something that will tend to slow the economy somewhat. And I believe they are taking this into account in deciding on appropriate policy,‚Äù Yellen added.

With tighter restrictions on business and personal loans, the economy will contract. As businesses are unable to procure funding, they will likely need to streamline costs, which will include conducting layoffs. These actions align with Powell‚Äôs policy to degrade the economy and labor market to beat inflation. The rationale behind the Fed‚Äôs policy is that if more people lose their jobs, they won‚Äôt spend as much money, and inflation will start easing downward.

What The SLOOS Says

The survey covers commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans. Due to economic conditions, banks are expected to tighten standards across all loan categories and see a deterioration in the credit quality of their loan portfolios and customers' collateral values. There will also be a reduction in risk tolerance and concerns about bank funding costs.

Banks are tightening credit terms and seeing a drop in loan demand. The survey shows that 46% of banks tightened credit terms for a key category of business loans for medium and large businesses compared with 44.8% in the prior survey in January. For small firms, conditions were slightly more stringent, with 46.7% of banks saying credit terms were stiffer now versus 43.8% in the last survey.

What Will Happen Next

In a press conference last Wednesday, Powell announced that the Fed would raise interest rates for the 10th consecutive time to a range of 5% to 5.25%. In his quest to dampen the economy to bring down record-high inflation, there will be collateral damage, including job cuts.

When rates rise, it amounts to an additional tax on households and companies. The extra costs deter spending for both consumers and corporations. As companies feel the effects of higher borrowing costs, they tighten their belts, cut costs and lay off workers. This is an intended consequence of Powell‚Äôs anti-inflation quest.

A tweet thread by Nick Gerli, a management consultant focused on real estate and lending, suggests that a significant slowdown in lending in 2023 could lead to layoffs and bankruptcies.

Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, New York Community Bank and PacWest Bancorp are just some banks that have announced layoffs throughout the 2022 and 2023 economic downturn.

The implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, the acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan and UBS‚Äôs takeover of Credit Suisse will cause significant job losses. Other banks will plan to downsize as well as they try to lower costs. The layoffs are coming at a time when many banks are facing tighter profit margins and a more uncertain economic outlook.

Layoffs in the banking industry will significantly impact already-reeling small and regional banks. The share prices of several financial institutions have plunged as fears spread. PacWest, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation and other small and regional banks have been the focus of hedge fund short selling, with allegations that they are in dire financial straits.","Bank Loan Officer Survey Shows That The Economy Will Slow Down, Leading To Layoffs",causal,"UBS, CNBC",['SLOOS'],[],"['CNBC', 'UBS']","['BAC', 'UBS', 'SLOOS', 'CNBC']",0.9934141

Barra made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on CNBC Thursday night. When asked about union leaders' claims that automakers have made record profits in recent years and need to reinvest that money in the workforce, Barra said that GM has shared its record profits with union members for years now and it has been reinvesting in factories.

Separately, Barra also said the automaker is open to more partnerships beyond the one she announced earlier in the day with Tesla to share in Tesla's vast charging network and the existing partnership GM started in 2020 with America Honda Motor Co. to build affordable electric cars to go on sale starting in 2027.

Barra also said the automaker continues to search for a new global marketing director and once it finds one, it is open to restarting paid advertising on Twitter, which GM halted in October in protest after Tesla CEO Elon Musk bought the social media company.

UAW members have 'done quite well' in profit sharing

In recent weeks, UAW President Shawn Fain and UAW Vice President of the GM Department Mike Booth have noted automakers' significant profit margins and high executive compensation in recent years. They say it's time for GM and others to share that with the workforce by ending wage tiers, ensuring job security and reestablishing cost-of-living allowances.

Last week, the UAW put out a scathing video on social media of Fain and Booth inside GM's factory in Kokomo, Indiana, showing a largely vacant factory. Fain criticized GM for essentially idling the production of semiconductor components there and cutting jobs.

""It's important that we actually get to the table and we start to problem solve,"" Barra said on CNBC. ""Of course, we have differences, but as you talk about record profits, one of the things that I'm very proud of is, we've shared that with our employees from a profit-sharing perspective, so, they've done quite well in participating in the success that they are important to.""

Barra commended GM's hourly workforce for its response after the COVID-19 shutdown and said for that reason, Barra wants to ""problem solve"" and find a contract agreement that's good for the company and employees.

""We need to continue to reinvest,"" Barra said. ""We've made some important announcements about reinvesting in these plants, because I think job security is very important. To do that, the company has to be successful, so we can develop new products that customers want to buy.""

This week, GM made three announcements about investing in gasoline-powered trucks, which fund GM's transition to EVs. On Monday, GM said it will invest $1 billion in Flint Assembly and Flint Metal Center to build the next generation of the automaker's gasoline-burning heavy duty pickups. On Tuesday, GM said it will invest CA$280 million ($208 million in U.S. dollars) to upgrade its Oshawa Assembly plant in Canada to build next generation full-size gasoline-powered pickups. On Thursday, GM said it will invest $500 million in its Arlington Assembly plant in Texas to upgrade the facility to build the next generation of full-size gasoline-powered SUVs.

GM is looking for ways to save money

Barra said GM is considering collaborations with rival automakers to gain cost efficiencies. For example, the collaboration with Tesla to share in its Supercharger Network starting next year, ""nearly doubles the amount of chargers that our GM customers will have access to. Frankly, we think we can save up to $400 million in the original three-quarter of a billion dollars that we allocated to this, because we've been able to do it faster and more effectively,"" she said.

She added that, ""If there's other opportunities to partner, we're going to be very open to them, in addition to this collaboration with Tesla, we have a very important collaboration with Honda. I think being capital efficient in this environment, that will allow us to get the best EVs out to the market, is crucial in this transformation.""

GM has said it has a target to remove $2 billion in expenses by the end of next year. As the Free Press first reported in February, GM cut several hundred jobs from its global salaried workforce. In April, 5,000 salaried employees agreed to a voluntary separation package that GM said would help it achieve close to 50% of its $2 billion cost-cutting target this year alone and prevent further involuntary cuts. Then last month, as the Free Press reported GM terminated ""several hundred"" contract employees who worked at its Global Technical Center in Warren as well as other locations to further shed costs.

'It's possible' GM could restart its paid advertising on Twitter

In March, GM's Global Marketing Chief Deborah Wahl retired. Since that time, Barra has been searching for a replacement.

When asked if the new charging agreement with Tesla changes GM's stance on boycotting advertising on Musk's Twitter, Barra said GM has been on Twitter offering customer service all along, but now ""we're in the process of reimagining marketing. We are in the market to bring in a new head of marketing. I think that's a good question and will be one of my first questions when this new person joins the GM team, so, I definitely think it's possible.""

Exxon XOM 0.31%increase; green up pointing triangle Mobil and Chevron CVX -1.04%decrease; red down pointing triangle collectively banked nearly $14 billion in second-quarter profits Friday, down from last year‚Äôs record-breaking levels but adding to their war chests as they eye acquisitions in the oil patch.

Exxon said it earned $7.9 billion in the second quarter, extending its run of strong quarters though its profit was down from the company‚Äôs $17.9 billion haul in the same time last year, when Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine skyrocketed energy prices. Chevron said it collected $6 billion in profit, dropping from a quarterly record of $11.6 billion in the same period last year.

The profits follow multibillion-dollar deals by both companies in recent months, and the oil giants have said they aren‚Äôt done shopping.

Exxon scooped up pipeline operator and oil producer Denbury for $4.9 billion in July and Chevron agreed in May to buy shale driller PDC Energy for $6.3 billion. Both transactions were all-stock, low-premium deals that showed the companies could still make big bets despite a push by Wall Street for austerity.

Kathy Mikells, Exxon‚Äôs chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company searches for unique assets that allow it to leverage its large scale and skills bringing products to market.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly looking for something where the equation would be one-plus-one equals three,‚Äù she said.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said in a recent TV interview his company is open to more deals following the PDC acquisition.

In picking off two smaller companies, Exxon and Chevron revealed some of their strategy to investors who have asked how they plan to grow as they sit on historically large piles of cash in the wake of last year‚Äôs energy price hikes.

Exxon and others have eyed potential deals in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most active U.S. oil field. In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon had held preliminary talks with Pioneer Natural Resources, a giant shale company in West Texas.

Conditions are ripe for a deal frenzy in the oil patch this year. The shale industry has shifted from the rapid growth it pursued for more than a decade to a mature business underpinned by fiscal restraint and hefty shareholder payouts. Drilling for new oil discoveries has fallen out of favor with investors, leaving many companies with few options other than to acquire rivals to extend their runway.

The continued run of profitable quarters has helped Exxon and Chevron improve their balance sheets while increasing dividends and buybacks, potentially giving them more leeway with shareholders to pursue deals. Analysts and investors expect Exxon and Chevron to eventually play a big role in scooping up the dozens of smaller shale companies that constitute the industry.

Both companies‚Äô profits fell modestly from the previous quarter, when Exxon reported $11.4 billion in profits and Chevron posted $6.6 billion. Exxon‚Äôs profit came in below analysts‚Äô expectations of $8.3 billion, according to FactSet. It attributed most of the $3.6 billion decline from the first quarter to lower natural-gas prices and thinner refining margins.

‚ÄúThe work we‚Äôve been doing to improve our underlying profitability is reflected in our second-quarter results, which doubled from what we earned in a comparable industry commodity price environment just five years ago,‚Äù Exxon CEO Darren Woods said.

Prices for crude, natural gas and fuels have fallen since last summer, when the national average for U.S. gasoline hit a historically high mark and fuel-making margins reached the widest levels on record.

Despite falling off their highs, commodity prices have remained elevated and are starting to climb again. U.S. oil prices settled above $80 a barrel on Thursday, the highest level since mid-April. Europe‚Äôs energy crunch has made shipping commodities from U.S. ports more profitable, as well. All of that has bolstered the companies‚Äô bottom line.

Exxon said it had $29.6 billion in cash at the end of the three-month period, compared with its record high of $32.7 billion at the end of March. The company expects a recent series of cost cuts will add up to $9 billion in savings by the end of this year, compared with spending in 2019.

Both companies also showered investors in cash. Exxon spent $8 billion on shareholder distributions via dividends and share buybacks in the quarter; Chevron spent a company record of $7.2 billion.

Emboldened by their strong results, the companies have begun to pursue growth in certain parts of their business, a reversal from pandemic-induced retrenchment.

Dan Ammann, president of Exxon‚Äôs low-carbon solutions business, said in an interview the company would consider accelerating its build-out of the relatively new unit via an acquisition if it found other compelling targets.

Exxon formed the low-carbon unit in 2021 to primarily invest in climate-friendly technologies, such as carbon capture, that it hopes will help curb emissions from the company‚Äôs fossil-fuels business and other industrial operations. It is planning to spend $7 billion through 2027 growing the business alongside $10 billion on curbing its own emissions.

Exxon also recently purchased drilling rights in a lithium-rich part of South Arkansas, seeking to extract the mineral, and has plans to build one of the world‚Äôs largest lithium processing facilities nearby, the Journal reported.

Chevron also created its own venture, known as Chevron New Energies, that aims to invest $10 billion through 2028 in carbon capture, hydrogen, renewable fuels and other technologies.

But investors say the companies‚Äô bigger desire is to buy more assets in the oil patch. Both are focused on the Permian, where both Exxon and Chevron have carved out vast strongholds and aspire to pump about as much oil as comes from the Bakken Shale of North Dakota.

Woods, Exxon‚Äôs CEO, has told investors the company is working on technology that will boost the amount of oil it can wring from a well in the Permian, as it seeks to grow production there to 1 million barrels a day by 2027.

Norfolk Southern opted to release the gas from the cars - potentially putting deadly fumes into the air - to prevent a disastrous explosion. Residents were told to evacuate the area but assured it was safe to return a week later.

If Norfolk Southern faces a congressional probe over the disaster, the company's connected PAC has positioned itself well between both political parties this past election cycle.

The PAC also disbursed $543,500 to party committees, with 57 percent making its way to Republican-aligned committees while 43 percent went to Democratic committees, according to a review of data compiled by OpenSecrets.

""The problem with inventory is two-fold: supply chain bottlenecks are clearing while demand, especially demand for goods, is slowing,"" Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michelle Weaver and Mike Wilson wrote in an Oct. 10 note. The strategists said that supply chains in the U.S. had stabilized across most industries, while demand for goods has been declining since the second quarter of 2021. As such, on average, U.S companies are now holding the highest level of inventory relative to sales since 1990 ‚Äî with inventory levels of companies in consumer staples, industrials and tech deemed to be sitting at ""elevated levels,"" Weaver and Wilson said.

Morgan Stanley believes the inventory problem has now become a risk to earnings, with oversupply and lagging demand likely to weigh on companies' margins. Who's at risk? However, although a broad problem for the market and for goods producing industries in particular, not all industries are impacted to the same degree, according to Morgan Stanley. The bank found that tech hardware and consumer retail companies are among the most at risk from excess inventory. The tech hardware segment includes the likes of Apple , HP , Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Western Digital on the S & P 500 , according to FactSet's classification.

The poll of nearly 2,200 U.S. adults carried out Thursday and Friday found 16% moved some or all of their money, though most transferred their assets to regional, local or digital banks. Some 73% of those who moved money are men, while 58% are members of the Millennial generation and almost half (46%) reported owning cryptocurrency‚Äîall numbers far higher than the makeup of the general U.S. population. Despite a sizable chunk of Americans deciding to shift where their money is held, almost nothing changed about the share of primary banking providers across demographics. Around 41% of Americans primarily use national banks, according to the poll, while 15% rely on regional banks, another 15% use community banks and 7% opt for digital banks‚Äîexactly the same numbers recorded before the banking failures. Credit unions were the only institutions recording a boost in primary usage, rising from 22% to 23%, within the poll‚Äôs two-point margin of error.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures up to $250,000 in each bank account in the event of a bank failure. The Treasury Department took the unusual step of letting depositors withdraw all of their money after SVB‚Äôs collapse, though, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has suggested similar measures could be taken if more banks fail.

What To Watch For

The poll found 23% of American adults are considering ‚Äústarting a relationship‚Äù with a new bank in the next six months‚Äîup from 15% in a February Morning Consult survey.

SVB‚Äôs collapse on March 10 following a social media-fueled bank run has roiled the banking industry‚Äîespecially some regional banks‚Äîdue to liquidity concerns. The run on SVB came after it announced plans to sell additional stock to raise funds, signaling that its decision to invest billions of dollars‚Äô worth of deposits in government bonds backfired when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. New York-based Signature Bank failed just days later under similar circumstances, while San Francisco-based First Republic Bank also appeared on a path toward collapse until big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo announced they‚Äôd make $30 billion in deposits in an attempt to rescue the beleaguered bank. First Republic‚Äôs stock has continued to crater, though‚Äîdeclining more than 87% in recent weeks‚Äîand it has reportedly reached out to JPMorgan Chase to explore a potential sale. SVB and Signature had far different client bases than most American banks, though, with Signature focused on crypto and SVB aligned with tech startups that largely had high-dollar accounts‚Äîabout 93% of SVB‚Äôs deposits were above the traditional $250,000 per account the FDIC insures, a far greater proportion than most banks.

The FDIC has set a deadline of 8 p.m. Wednesday for prospective buyers to submit bids to buy SVB (the Treasury Department took control of the bank after it collapsed). The deadline has been delayed several times, however, and it‚Äôs unclear if a buyer will emerge Wednesday evening.

Thefts executed by packs of robbers have garnered attention during the crime wave of the past two years, with some retailers spending heavily on new security measures or closing locations in particularly dangerous cities.

While the Combatting Organized Retail Crime Act would facilitate coordination among law enforcement agencies and businesses, the INFORM Consumers Act would prevent the resale of stolen goods by requiring verification for high-volume third-party sellers on platforms such as Facebook Marketplace.

Supporters of the legislation assert that federal assets have a role in preventing organized retail theft because Congress is mandated to regulate interstate commerce.

Yet their earnings remain under pressure.

Many lenders this week revised down their estimates of a key measure of profitability, net interest income, which shows the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay to attract deposits.

Executives said they expect these margins to get smaller in the second quarter because they are paying more to bring in deposits as the fight for funding gets more competitive across the industry.

The guidance from the chief operating officer of Zions (ZION) was that net interest income for the next 12 months would be ""decreasing,"" a downgrade from ""moderately decreasing.""

John Woods, CFO for Citizens Financial Group (CFG), said its decline would be ‚Äúa little more‚Äù than the 3% previously predicted.

The finance chief of KeyCorp (KEY) said net interest income would be ""in the range of down 12"" percent, more than twice a prior prediction.

""We're going to come in softer than we thought,"" said KeyCorp CFO Clark Khayat.

The warnings, all delivered at a Morgan Stanley conference in New York, offered an early preview of what could be in store when lenders release their second-quarter results in mid July.

'We all knew this was coming'

Regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the failures of three lenders within a matter of days triggered panic across the country. And many are now attracting back some of the deposits they lost in the spring.

But they still face some of the same macroeconomic problems that contributed to the turmoil, including high interest rates.

An aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation has lowered the value of the assets banks hold, such as loans or bonds, just as deposit costs creep higher to keep customers from seeking higher yields elsewhere.

""We all knew this was coming,"" Tim Coffey, an analyst with Janney told Yahoo Finance. ""The whole reason we‚Äôre seeing lower net interest for 2Q is because the Fed went parabolic with rate increases.""

The Fed last Wednesday made it clear this past week that more hikes are coming this year. But it also decided to pause in June, which does buy banks some time.

""With the pause it gives banks a chance to catch up to the new reality,"" Coffey said.

'The crisis may not be over'

For the moment investors are sending stocks mostly higher.

Since hitting a year to date low on May 4, the week regulators seized First Republic and sold the bulk of its operations to JPMorgan Chase, the KBW Regional Bank Index (KRX) has rallied 15%, outpacing the S&P 500 during that time. That run has included four straight weeks of gains. The index closed slightly down Friday.

Some of the banks that experienced the most turmoil in the spring are among the best performers. The stock of PacWest (PACW) has climbed 159%, while Western Alliance (WAL) is up 113%. Zions has climbed 45%.

Investors are hoping some of these stocks return to pre-crisis valuations, but it won't be easy, said Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist with Interactive Brokers.

""It's going to take time for people to really go through each bank in a granular fashion to figure out whether there are more minefields out there,"" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance.

Timothy Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, told Yahoo Finance his firm added to its holdings of Western Alliance in late May and those positions are now up roughly 18%.

His firm, he said, likes the fact that Western Alliance has reduced its reliance on uninsured depositors, who are more likely to flee during times of stress.

""These banks are likely to attract assets going forward given that they're survivors of the crisis, but the crisis may not be over,"" Ghriskey said. ""The group in general is attractive, but it's probably not going to be smooth sailing, it's not going to be straight up.""

Many of these banks, in fact, are still below where they traded at the start of the year. PacWest is still down 64% year to date, Zions is down 41% and Western Alliance is 37% lower than its Jan. 1 level. Many fell during trading on Friday.

""Even though they've rallied pretty strongly since early May, they‚Äôre still way below their February highs,"" Matt Maley, Miller Tabak Chief Market Strategist told Yahoo Finance.

""There are a lot of reasons to be cautious but like anything else, the ones that survive are going to look really, really good five years from now,"" Maley added.

Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with Wells Fargo, told Bloomberg he didn‚Äôt expect any more banks to fail in the immediate term.

""The detour for not owning bank stocks is over,"" he said during an appearance on Bloomberg Surveillance. ""There‚Äôs over 4,500 banks. You‚Äôre going to have bank failures ‚Äî that‚Äôs the rule of banking. It‚Äôs not going to be any bank in the S&P 500, in my view, over the immediate time-frame. So that phase is over.""

There still could be trouble ahead for many banks, even if they don‚Äôt fail. Regulators are preparing new capital requirements that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase their stability but will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits.

The larger banks aren‚Äôt immune to challenges, either. Many with big Wall Street operations are suffering through a drought of deal making that will likely drag down their second-quarter results.

Citigroup said on Wednesday it would be eliminating 1,600 people during the second quarter, the latest giant institution to announce Wall Street-related cuts.

Even JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the nation‚Äôs biggest and most profitable bank, is feeling pressure from an industry wide fight for deposits that is making life more difficult for its smaller rivals.

""Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,"" Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said Wednesday.

The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion this year, but if the deposit pressure keeps up that figure could experience a ""mild reprice,"" she said.

But investors shouldn‚Äôt assume banks can just keep on snubbing depositors.

Though the Federal Reserve has pegged market rates of interest above 5%, getting more than 4% on a savings account is tough. A handful of banks are there, such as Pittsburgh-based PNC and Goldman Sachs‚Äô online arm Marcus, but the average rate paid in May was 0.73%, data from think tank Center for Financial Stability suggests.

Of course, where bank customers lose, investors gain. With most Wall Street megabanks set to report second-quarter earnings next week and their European counterparts a week later, a correct assessment of ‚Äúdeposit betas‚Äù‚Äîthe portion of rate changes that banks pass on to depositors‚Äîis crucial.

The CFS figure is very broad and underplays what banks offer new customers. Financial filings suggest that deposits at big lenders such as JPMorgan and Bank of America return between 1.3% and 2%. Moreover, it was normal before 2008 for deposits to yield less than central-bank rates. Still, today‚Äôs gap between the two is unusually wide.

The trend in Europe is similar. In the U.K., instant-access deposits paid 1.83% in June even as rates rose to 5%, sparking accusations of profiteering from lawmakers. In the eurozone, households and companies got a 2.4% and 3% return in May, respectively, while the European Central Bank rate reached 3.5%.

But investors who expect this situation to last may be too complacent. During the first quarter, even small increases in deposit costs forced analysts to trim their net interest margin forecasts for U.S. banks. In Europe, Germany‚Äôs Commerzbank warned about a peak in interest margins. The same could happen in the coming earnings season.

Median sell-side forecasts collected by Visible Alpha see margins expanding powerfully this year, and then giving up some of those gains in 2024 as deposit expenses catch up. However, even these 2024 margins would be about 0.3 percentage-point narrower at several major global banks if deposit betas rose to their historical averages, assuming constant interest rates, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest.

It could be that central banks start lowering rates again next year, as derivatives markets seem to assume. In that case, it is forecasts for returns on loans that could start to look overly optimistic.

The ECB recently warned in its biannual financial-stability outlook that bank funding costs could jump as clients shift money from overnight to higher-yielding term deposits. Because of the past decade of near-zero rates, the former makes up a whopping 61% of eurozone deposits, compared with 39% in 2013.

Similarly, negative-yielding short-term debt made people avoid money-market funds, which relative to deposits have stagnated on both sides of the Atlantic since 2010. Now, they are paying 4.8% in the U.S., according to Crane Data. This is stiff competition, especially for smaller lenders seen as risky after the March banking crisis.

Individual savers can often take a while to start seeking yield. But they are on the case now: Money-market fund holdings in the U.S. have ballooned to record levels. The Bank of England recently noted that U.K. households withdrew the highest volume of funds on record from banks in May, which was partially offset by an inflow into time deposits.

‚ÄúBetween higher returns and lower risk, the movement out of bank deposits is going to accelerate and we expect we are going to see a stampede out of bank deposits in the coming months,‚Äù said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Opimas.

Many analysts appear to disagree, citing a number of reasons why deposit betas will stay lower for longer, particularly for big banks. These institutions have become more concentrated, and user-friendly online-banking applications could make their deposit franchises stronger than in the past.

Then again, for banks as a whole, it is also possible to argue the opposite. Digital platforms have made it easier for savers to shop around for higher-yielding products and shift their money accordingly, be it into money-market funds or the offerings of new online and fintech players, which have risen to dominate new checking accounts. Europe may offer a natural experiment: Banks in France and the Netherlands, countries with more modern financial ecosystems that include more fintech options, have increased deposit rates far above those in Italy, Spain and Portugal, data by Jefferies analysts suggests.

Thousands of third-party sellers who ship products themselves will start paying a 2% fee on each sale in October, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. That‚Äôs on top of the commission ‚Äî usually 15% ‚Äî that merchants already pay Amazon to sell products on the popular web store.

Several merchants interviewed by Bloomberg interpreted the new fee as an attempt to pressure them into using Amazon‚Äôs logistics services rather than fulfilling orders themselves. The company didn‚Äôt explain to sellers why the levy was required, but told Bloomberg it will help cover the costs of running a separate infrastructure and measuring its effectiveness.

Amazon has been accused of having too much power over the some 2 million merchants who use its platform, which captures about 37.6% of all online spending in the US, according to Insider Intelligence, or about six times more than its closest online competitor Walmart Inc. The Federal Trade Commission is in the final stages of preparing an antitrust case against Amazon, and the timing of the new fee took some merchants and consultants by surprise.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting here waiting for the FTC to take action against Amazon for antitrust issues, and this fee shows Amazon is not scared at all,‚Äù said Jason Boyce, whose Avenue7Media helps about 100 businesses sell products online.

In recent years, Amazon has been ratcheting up fees on merchants, who typically pay for advertising and logistics to help maximize their sales. The business has become increasingly important to the company as sales growth in the core online operation slows. Seller services generated $32.3 billion in the second quarter, up 18% from the same period a year earlier and more than the profitable cloud services business. Last year, for the first time, seller fees began gobbling up about half the cost of each sale, making it harder for merchants to make a profit.

The new fee targets merchants who use Seller Fulfilled Prime, a service that lets them handle logistics themselves and still get an Amazon Prime badge, which lets customers know they can expect quick delivery. These merchants often sell bulkier items such as furniture that don‚Äôt mesh well with Amazon‚Äôs highly automated warehouses, which are designed to mostly handle smaller products.

Amazon launched Seller Fulfilled Prime in 2015 as a way to expand inventory without overloading its fulfillment centers. It closed enrollment in the program a few years later saying merchants were having difficulty meeting Amazon‚Äôs delivery standards. Amazon in June announced it would again open enrollment for Seller Fulfilled Prime, a move the company saw as a way to appease regulators investigating it for antitrust issues, according to people familiar with the matter.

Amazon informed merchants about the new fee last week.

One office furniture merchant enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime said the fee will cost his company approximately $1 million a year, forcing it to raise prices. He will probably continue to use the service because Amazon has so many customers but notes that he‚Äôs not getting anything extra in return for paying the fee.

Another merchant also expected to raise prices to cover the new fee and said that, for many merchants using the service, the 2% levy will wipe out as much as one-third of already meager profit margins. He also said Amazon only gave sellers a few weeks notice, making it difficult to adjust because inventory had already been ordered for the busy holiday shopping season.

Both sellers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon.

‚ÄúWe are excited to offer Seller Fulfilled Prime to sellers as a way to independently handle fulfillment of their products while also making those products available to Prime customers with fast, free delivery, great customer service and free returns,‚Äù Amazon spokesperson Jonathon Hillson said.

Amazon‚Äôs seller fees have been a focus of regulators and lawmakers since at least 2019, when a merchant accused Amazon of using its dominance in e-commerce to force sellers to use its logistics services. The allegation, since echoed by multiple sellers, has emerged as a focus of the FTC‚Äôs antitrust case against Amazon, according to people familiar with the situation.

Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive officer of Marketplace Pulse, which monitors online sales, says Amazon has been making it harder and harder in recent years for merchants to qualify for Seller Fulfilled Prime. The upshot: ‚ÄúMost sellers use Fulfillment By Amazon instead.‚Äù",University Starts Probe Into Author of Superconductor Claim,non-causal,"FTC, US",['US'],['A'],"['FTC', 'US']","['AMZN', 'A', 'FTC', 'US']",-0.9998073

The chipmaker‚Äôs first-quarter results late Thursday took the ‚Äúbetter than feared‚Äù concept to a new level. Revenue plunged 36% year over year‚Äîthe company‚Äôs worst quarterly drop since at least the early ‚Äô90s, which is as far back as data from S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. Its operating loss of nearly $1.5 billion was also a record over that time frame. In another first, Intel actually lost money in its data-center segment‚Äîa business that generated operating margins of 50% in the same quarter just three years prior.

Still, those results were better than Wall Street had anticipated, and overall revenue was even a bit better than Intel‚Äôs brutal forecast three months ago. Thus, Intel‚Äôs stock price jumped nearly 5% Friday morning. It was overdue for some upside. Intel‚Äôs market value has been decimated over the past two years as the company has embarked on an expensive and risky turnaround plan to regain its manufacturing edge and build up a new business making chips designed by others, called a foundry. Before Thursday‚Äôs results, Intel‚Äôs stock price had shed one-third of its value over the previous 12 months‚Äîthe worst performance of any tech company with a market value exceeding $100 billion, according to FactSet.

To be sure, Intel still has a deep hole to climb out of. To get its manufacturing process caught up with market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, Intel is pursuing a plan to advance through five so-called manufacturing nodes in four years. The company‚Äôs latest node, which it calls Intel 4, is on track to start volume production in the second half of this year, and is Intel‚Äôs first using the extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography technology vital for producing the most advanced semiconductors. Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research calls this ‚Äúa major milestone‚Äù that will improve Intel‚Äôs competitiveness.

But Intel 4 is still based on 7-nanometer technology, while TSMC is already shipping more advanced 5-nanometer chips at high volume. The chip giant even previewed its 3-nanometer technology earlier this week, at a trade show less than 2 miles from Intel‚Äôs Silicon Valley headquarters.

Intel‚Äôs deep roots in advanced chipmaking make such a gambit plausible‚Äîif a long shot. But the company can‚Äôt afford more stumbles on that path. And it has to fund that effort while also coping with a sharp downturn in demand for both PC and data-center processors, which combined account for more than 80% of its revenue. PCs at least may start getting a little better. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Thursday‚Äôs analyst call that the bloated inventory in the PC market that has depressed chip sales there ‚Äúis tracking to be at a healthy level by the end of Q2.‚Äù

The data-center business may remain a tough market for Intel this year. Cloud giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are now focusing their capital spending on building up generative artificial intelligence capabilities, which require more of the graphics processors made by Nvidia rather than the CPU processors that Intel specializes in. And even success in its rapid catch-up effort may create new challenges; Ed Snyder of Charter Equity noted that ‚Äúreleasing five nodes in four years will probably be too fast for customers to absorb the new products anywhere close to the rate of past upgrades.‚Äù For Intel at least, that would finally be a high-quality problem to have.",Intel Faces a Long Climb Back from the Bottom,non-causal,"TSMC, PC, EUV, CPU",['TSMC'],[],"['TSMC', 'CPU', 'EUV', 'PC']","['TSMC', 'INTC', 'PC', 'CPU', 'EUV']",0.054191016

The big picture: Price volatility is the new normal ‚Äî at least when it comes to electric vehicles ‚Äî as automakers face intensifying competition while responding to commodity costs and other economic factors.
‚Ä¢ ""You have more extreme forces at play than you usually have ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs inflation, interest rates, government incentives and the price of materials that go into the production of a car, like lithium and nickel and palladium,"" iSeeCars.com analyst Karl Brauer tells Axios.

Why it matters: Dramatic price fluctuation increases the importance of purchase timing as some customers will pay more than others for the same vehicle.

How it (usually) works: Traditionally, automakers suggest a retail price for dealers, who then have the option of applying incentives to juice sales or, as has happened more recently, selling vehicles for above the MSRP.
‚Ä¢ Although prices certainly vary somewhat depending on the time of year, it's not normal for prices to change by thousands of dollars from one day to the next.

But EVs are charting a new path:
‚Ä¢ Tesla has cut prices several times this year ‚Äî with prices now down about 10% to 15% depending on the vehicle, Bank of America analyst John Murphy estimated.
‚Ä¢ Ford cut the price of the Mustang Mach-E earlier this year in response to Tesla price cuts, while it's raised the starting price of its F-150 Lightning more than $15,000 above its initial level.

At the same time, the types of vehicles that qualify for full or partial federal EV tax credits has changed again after the federal government recently delivered its verdict on qualifying standards.

Between the lines: Recent drops in the price of lithium have made EV manufacturing cheaper, while overall inflation continues to ease up.

What they're saying: ""It just feels like there are more external circumstances that can impact a car‚Äôs cost to produce than there probably have ever been before,"" Brauer says.

The impact: For automakers, sudden price changes can jolt sales, boost profits, both or neither. It depends on how customers react.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other executives are scheduled to brief investors Thursday on the automaker's progress toward scaling up production capacity to deliver 1 million electric vehicles a year in North America by 2025.

Work is underway on new agreements to support higher levels of North American battery production, Sham Kunjur, GM's executive director for EV Raw Materials' Center of Excellence.

""Watch this space,"" Kunjur said. ""You'll start seeing more announcements.""

Securing more domestic capacity for cathode active materials is one priority, he said.

Kunjur said his organization is new within GM, and combines legal teams, merger and acquisition experts and treasury staff to work on joint ventures, equity investments and alliances to secure access to battery and magnet materials or production capacity.

Tesla took an early lead in developing in-house battery production in the United States with its first Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.

Among established North American automakers, GM has moved the fastest to emulate Tesla's strategy of building a battery manufacturing network from lithium extraction to assembly of battery packs and cells. GM's Ultium LLC joint venture with LG Energy Solutions has announced plans for four North American battery plants.

New federal subsidy policies signed into law in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act could turn that domestic battery supply chain into a federally funded boost for GM's bottom line.

The IRA's EV tax credits and subsidies are designed to support domestic EV manufacturing. They could move GM closer to making money on affordably priced electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, which will have a starting price of about $30,000, roughly half the price of a Tesla Model Y.

The Inflation Reduction Act ties up to $3,750 per vehicle of federal tax credits to requirements that EV batteries be manufactured in North America using materials sourced in North America or from allied nations.

How much GM will reap in federal subsidies will depend on how technical rules are written by federal agencies. Analysts expect Tesla will harvest more overall than any rival through 2030.

""We'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in 2 to 3 years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States,"" Barra said during a conference call on Oct. 25.

The typical operation handles $250,000 in stolen merchandise before law enforcement intervenes, according to a report from the National Retail Federation, while the typical booster employed by a criminal network steals $5,000 before he is arrested.

The trade association noted that crime networks have become increasingly ‚Äúviolent‚Äù and ‚Äúbrazen‚Äù in their tactics over the past two years, using methods such as smash-and-grab and threats of violence against store employees and customers.

Target revealed six months ago that organized retail theft contributed to a $400 million financial loss, appearing to indicate that the problem continues to worsen.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is violent incidents are increasing at our stores and across the entire retail industry,‚Äù Cornell added. ‚ÄúAnd when products are stolen, simply put, they‚Äôre no longer available for our guests who depend on them.

On Thursday, Corona and Modelo maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 510 basis point year-over-year plunge in its beer segment's operating profits for the just-completed quarter. The culprit: across-the-board inflation.

""Benefits from favorable pricing were more than offset by increased COGS [cost of goods sold] driven by higher packaging, raw materials, incremental depreciation, and logistics costs, and increased SG&A [selling, general and administrative] driven by increased headcount to align with the momentum of our beer brands,"" Constellation Brands said on its earnings release.

By comparison, lower grape prices in the company's wine business ‚Äî led by top brands such as Kim Crawford ‚Äî drove a 500 basis point year-over-year improvement in that segment's operating profits in the quarter.

Constellation isn't alone in feeling the inflationary sting on beer input costs.

Budweiser giant AB-InBev (BUD) saw its operating profit margins fall 147 basis points year over year in its most recent quarter, as reported in early March.

Similar to Constellation Brands, Ab-InBev called out elevated levels of inflation.

""Inflation was above what was originally planned [last year],"" AB-InBev CEO Michel Doukeris told analysts on a conference call.

To try and offset the nagging input inflation, beer makers continue to push through price increases on consumers.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the average price of a 24-pack of 12 oz. beer went up nearly 8% per Nielsen data.

The at-home beer, ale, and other malt beverages category in the Consumer Price Index report showed a 7% year-over-year jump in February.

GM will offer these buyouts for all U.S. salaried employees who have been with the company for at least five years and global executives with at least two years of service. Salaried employees who take the offer will receive one month of pay for each year of service with the company (up to 12 months), along with COBRA health insurance coverage. Executives who take the package will receive base salary, incentives, COBRA coverage and have access to outplacement services.

In an 8-K filing submitted by GM on Thursday, the automaker says it expects to take a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge, and up to $300 million in pre-tax, non-cash pension curtailment charges. GM said the majority of the charges would likely be incurred in the first half of 2023.

Only a few weeks back GM initiated performance-based job cuts, which the company made clear to say did not amount to layoffs, for 500 salaried employees, less than 1% of GM‚Äôs 81,000 global salaried workforce.

This came after GM reported strong fourth quarter earnings, driven by record revenue. At the time GM was adamant that layoffs where not being considered.

‚ÄúI want to be clear, we're not considering any layoffs as part of that [$2 billion in cost savings].

At the time, GM‚Äôs insistence of no planned job cuts was an anomaly given the overall industry at the time. Ford stated it would lay off 3,800 workers in Europe as part of it cost-cutting plan, and Stellantis idled its Jeep Cherokee plant in Belvidere, NJ, leaving 1,350 factory workers permanently furloughed starting on March 1st.

‚ÄúAstonishingly bad,‚Äù Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said of the performance at Intel, a company that once set the pace for the entire chip industry. South Korea‚Äôs Hynix posted the largest loss in its history and vowed to slash output, capital expenditure and other costs in a bid to recover.

Meanwhile, TSMC reported surging earnings and, while acknowledging some weakness in demand, predicted it would boost revenue again in 2023. The Taiwanese company overtook Intel as the leading producer of advanced logic chips and pulled in almost $13 billion more in revenue than its US rival. Samsung also fared much better than its peers, and flaunted its success by promising to maintain capital spending while all of its rivals retreat.

The reality is that the two East Asian companies have built more robust businesses and their scale now threatens to bury the competition. TSMC has proven so skilled at crafting bespoke chips for customers like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. that no other chipmaker has a chance of closing the gap anytime soon. Samsung, the closest to matching TSMC‚Äôs manufacturing prowess, has used that advantage to lap rivals like Hynix and Micron Technology Inc. in the memory-chip business.

Semiconductor industry downturns vary in length and severity, but bigger companies typically weather them better. That is proving true again. Makers of everything from smartphones to personal computers and industrial equipment built up too much inventory, and as a result have cut orders. They hit the brakes much faster than suppliers could rein in production, causing price declines and a costly lurch to slow factory output.

South Korea‚Äôs Samsung, the world‚Äôs largest chipmaker by revenue, had a horrible fourth quarter. Revenue at its semiconductor unit fell 24% from the same period a year ago and operating income plunged to a fraction of where it had been just three months earlier. Still, it was able to scrape together a profit, when smaller rivals Western Digital Corp., Micron and Hynix all reported losses.

‚ÄúSamsung makes positive cash flow, while rivals are bleeding cash,‚Äù said Marcello Ahn, portfolio manager at Quad Investment Management. ‚ÄúWhen the memory industry enters the next upcycle, Samsung‚Äôs cost base will be much lower than others and its margin will be higher.‚Äù

In memory in particular, being able to spread the massive costs of running chip plants over a greater volume of products shipped helps make operations more cost-effective.

TSMC has caught and passed Intel quicker than even the most optimistic analysts had predicted. Revenue at the Taiwanese company whose plants serve many of the world‚Äôs biggest firms with outsourced production surged 33% last year while Intel‚Äôs declined 20%. It offers many of Intel‚Äôs competitors and customers the most advanced production available.

In the chip industry, leadership isn‚Äôt just measured in market share and revenue. More than in perhaps any other business, production technology is vital to the performance of semiconductors. Being able to use the very latest techniques and equipment gives chipmakers not just better costs, but the ability to produce chips they can sell at a higher price because they‚Äôre more capable.

Intel, the company that dominated semiconductors for decades ‚Äî and whose products gave Silicon Valley its name ‚Äî got its position partly via an aggressive use of the brutal economics of the industry. Executives would tell investors that spending heavily on new plants, equipment, and research and design ‚Äî particularly when earnings were under pressure ‚Äî was the best use of company resources. The logic was that when the next period of strong demand came along, Intel would be in a better position to capitalize than competitors who backed off and allowed their production to stagnate.

Both of Intel‚Äôs East Asian rivals have taken a page out of that playbook. TSMC is planning to lay out as much as $36 billion on capital expenditure this year, which would be more than analysts projected. Earlier this week Samsung also defied pressure to scale back investment, and said it would spend at a similar level to 2022, when it poured about $39 billion into upgrading production and building facilities.

Intel, which decided not to give projections for this year, said it‚Äôs targeting ‚Äúcapex intensity‚Äù of about 35% of revenue. Analysts estimate Intel‚Äôs revenue will be about $51 billion this year, indicating its budget will be much smaller than either TSMC or Samsung‚Äôs.

In memory chips, where Samsung gets most of its semiconductor revenue, budget cuts for 2023 are also planned at Micron, Hynix and Western Digital, which operates a joint venture for production with Japan‚Äôs Kioxia Holdings Corp.

While TSMC‚Äôs aggressive spending plans may put more pressure on Intel, it‚Äôs likely good news for a swath of companies across the electronics industry and beyond. Many of them have leveraged TSMC‚Äôs capabilities to create and manufacture new products, where they‚Äôd previously have struggled to supplant Intel chips. Apple is the most notable example, with its Silicon chips for iPhones and Mac computers fabricated exclusively by TSMC.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which for most of its existence has struggled in Intel‚Äôs shadow, uses TSMC to manufacture its server and PC processors and graphics chips. The company now gets more revenue per quarter than it was bringing in annually as recently as 2017. In the fourth quarter, AMD‚Äôs datacenter business posted a sales increase of 42% from a year earlier. Intel, meanwhile, saw its datacenter and artificial intelligence business fall 33%.

‚ÄúWe are in the early innings of a historical/generational shift in compute power in Silicon Valley,‚Äù Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in response to that divergence of results.

Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of smartphone chips and a TSMC and Samsung manufacturing customer, showed signs of success in its push into new businesses in the December quarter, when revenue from its automotive and connected devices divisions helped offset a slump in mobile phone demand.

Concerns over deposit flight are still swirling around some regional banks. Some fund managers, however, believe the sell-off has created bargains and are building positions in companies they think will pull through.

""There's an awful lot of companies that we think of as being relatively far away from the center of the storm that are down more than 20%, so the valuations have improved materially,"" said Hunter Doble, a portfolio manager at Hotchkis & Wiley. He owns shares of large regional banks including Citizens Financial Group Inc., which have fallen about 22% so far this year, and US Bancorp, which are down some 18%.

Recent developments have buoyed hopes that the banking crisis may be contained. U.S. regulators said on Monday they would backstop a deal for regional lender First Citizens BancShares to acquire SVB, sending the rescuer's shares up nearly 54% on the day.

On Saturday, Bloomberg News reported that U.S. authorities are considering expanding an emergency lending facility that would offer banks more support.

Lawmakers are expected to put top U.S. bank regulators on the defensive over the unexpected failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank when they testify before Congress on Tuesday.

Margie Patel, a senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, has been adding new positions in regional banks over the last few weeks, citing ""value.""

""The decline that we've seen in the sector is reflecting fears of repeating 2008 but I think it's fundamentally different,"" she said.

Banks will soon have a better match between revenue from higher-rate loans made over the past year and higher interest payments to depositors, a balance that went ""out of whack"" after the Federal Reserve raised benchmark rates nearly 500 basis points, Patel said.

Inflows into bank stocks and ETFs are also being bolstered as retail investors seek bargains in battered shares, analysts at Vanda Research said last week.

Still, plenty of headwinds remain, especially for smaller banks whose clients have moved deposits to larger banks for greater stability. Clients may also be ditching their checking accounts in favor of short-term Treasuries, money markets and other investments with far higher yields.

Large banks gained $120 billion in deposits but small banks lost $109 billion last week, while money market fund balances grew by $121 billion, adding to record inflows earlier in the month, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Regional banks ""need positive news that shows their deposits are holding firm or growing,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at family office Cherry Lane Investments.

Investors have in recent days become more confident the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting, as worries over financial stability have ebbed. Higher rates could pressure margins while further boosting the allure of higher-yielding products that have been draining deposits.

Investors on Tuesday morning were pricing a 48% chance of another rate hike, up from a 17% chance on Friday, according to CME FedWatch Tool.

Still, Christopher Marinac, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, believes regional banks have stronger balance sheets than many fear, which enable them to weather a recession and an increase in bad loans.

Marinac recommends buying PacWest Bancorp and New York Community Bancorp Inc, citing gains in the industry's loan loss reserve ratio - money set aside to cover bad loans - to an estimated 1.12% from 0.92% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

""The deep cuts stem from weakening demand for computers and smartphones, and the wider semiconductor industry is likely to follow the trend.



""Hard times are ahead for the industry, except for a few,"" said Kazunori Ito, an analyst with Morningstar. 


These souring developments in the global semiconductor market come as the largest US manufacturer of memory chips, Micron, reported revenue that missed (despite a slight beat on EPS and margins), but it was the forecast that again was a total disaster. 

Micron offered one of the most significant recession warnings so far from a large corporation: ""results were impacted by rapidly weakening consumer demand and significant customer inventory adjustments across all end markets."" It added that due to the sharp decline in near-term demand, it expects ""supply growth to be above demand growth in calendar 2022.""


""Yes, we have a challenging market environment, but we're responding rapidly with actions ... fiscal 2023 is, of course, an unprecedented environment, but the long-term drivers are intact,"" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in an interview. 


But it's just not memory chips. We pointed prices of graphics processing units (GPUs) have plunged to their lowest levels ever in China, and chip deflation was already washing ashore in the US. 

The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) has fallen 40% since peaking in late 2021, and the weekly 200-day moving average is being tested. 



Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported Apple ditched plans to increase iPhone production due to a lack of demand. Weeks ago, FedEx warned that the global economy is ""going into a worldwide recession.""

If both the semi-industry and top shippers are warning about economic turmoil ahead, then it's probably time to start preparing for a possible recession in 2023. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve continues to hike into a slowdown aggressively -- this is a recipe for an epic policy error. 

On the bright side, now, or at least in the months ahead, it might make sense to build a computer as it seems components, such as memory chips, GPUs, and CPUs, could be heavily discounted.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it has not determined exactly how close a FedEx cargo plane passed over the top of a Southwest Airlines jet last month in Austin, Texas, but there was little margin .

‚ÄúWe still believe the planes were within 100 feet of each other,‚Äù NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in an interview.

An air traffic controller had cleared both planes to use the same runway, the NTSB said in a preliminary report. The FedEx pilots pulled up at the last second to avoid a collision.

The NTSB is also investigating an incident Monday night at Boston‚Äôs Logan International Airport in which a Learjet pilot who was told by an air traffic controller to wait instead began to take off as a JetBlue plane approached to land on an intersecting runway. The JetBlue pilots pulled up, avoiding a collision .

Those and similar incidents in New York, California and Hawaii led the head of the Federal Aviation Administration to call for a ‚Äúsafety summit‚Äù and ignited a debate about whether air safety is declining or the events are just an unusual cluster of serious close calls.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that I can say that it‚Äôs a trend, but these are disturbing because it just takes one,‚Äù Homendy said. ‚ÄúThat is why we investigate incidents ‚Äî so that we can identify problems, especially when we see trends, and address them before they become a full-blown accident.‚Äù

Among the other recent incidents now being investigated:

‚Äî Last week pilots of a small airliner aborted their landing in Burbank, California, after a controller cleared another plane to take off from the same runway ; the NTSB is investigating .

‚Äî A United Airlines jet crossed a runway at Honolulu International Airport in front of a Cessna cargo plane that was landing on the same runway on Jan. 23.

‚Äî The NTSB took the rare step of issuing subpoenas for pilots of an American Airlines plane that crossed a runway that a Delta Air Lines jet was using to take off Jan. 13 at New York‚Äôs John F. Kennedy International Airport. The American pilots initially refused to sit for recorded interviews, but they complied after getting subpoenas, Homendy said.

‚Äî Federal officials are taking another look at an incident in which a United Airlines jet taking off from Hawaii dove to within 800 feet of the ocean before recovering. United says pilots of the December flight are getting additional training.

Except for the United plane that descended sharply after takeoff, the other incidents were ‚Äúrunway incursions‚Äù in which a plane wound up on a runway when it was not supposed to be there. A 2017 forum convened by the NTSB found that the most common causes of runway incursions were pilots ignoring orders from air traffic controllers, or miscommunication between pilots and controllers.

‚ÄúRunway incursions have always been an area of concern, but it looks worse because the system is so safe,‚Äù said John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ‚ÄúWe fortunately don‚Äôt have many accidents, so we focus on these risk precursors.‚Äù

Pilots are the last line of defense in aviation safety. In some of the recent incidents -- notably the one in Austin -- pilots spotted something wrong and reacted quickly.

The incidents may put an end to any possibility of easing experience requirements for newly hired pilots, which is something that smaller, regional airlines have requested to help them cope with a pilot shortage. President Joe Biden‚Äôs nominee for the top job at the Federal Aviation Administration, Phillip Washington, said Wednesday that he opposes easing the pilot-qualification standards.

Besides the close calls, there have also been several recent incidents involving severe turbulence causing injuries on planes. In the most recent case, a Lufthansa plane flying from Austin to Germany diverted to Washington Dulles International Airport on Wednesday night; seven people on board were hurt badly enough to go to hospitals. The FAA said it is investigating.

The close calls have attracted the attention of lawmakers, who questioned the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration about them during recent hearings. The official, Billy Nolen, defended the safety of the nation‚Äôs air-travel system last month while acknowledging the need for vigilance.

‚ÄúWe are experiencing the safest period in aviation history, but we do not take that for granted,‚Äù Nolen told a Senate committee. ‚ÄúRecent events remind us that we cannot become complacent.‚Äù

Nolen, like executives of the airline industry, point out that there has not been a fatal crash involving a U.S. airline plane since 2009, an unprecedented stretch.

Still, he said at the hearing and in an internal memo, he was forming a ‚Äúsafety review team‚Äù to examine the aviation system, starting with a meeting in March ‚Äúto examine what additional actions the aviation community needs to take to maintain our safety record.‚Äù Nolen said aviation leaders will look into which steps are working ‚Äúand why others appear to be not as effective as they once were.‚Äù

The deposit decline was the largest since the FDIC began collecting quarterly industry data in 1984 and marked the fourth consecutive quarter of industry outflows. The FDIC tracks performance for 4,672 commercial banks and savings institutions.

The drop in deposits was largely due to movement by uninsured depositors who were above the $250,000-per account level backstopped by the FDIC. They pulled $663 billion, while insured deposits actually increased by $255 billion.

The FDIC report covers a period marked by an aggressive rise in interest rates and the failures of three banks in a matter of days, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank on March 10 and March 12. First Republic later went down in the second quarter, on May 1, in what was the second-largest bank failure in US history.

""The more lasting effects of the industry's response to that stress may not become fully apparent until we've received the second quarter results,"" FDIC chair Martin Gruenberg said in a press briefing with reporters.

The new report shows that other lenders beyond Silicon Valley Bank experienced extreme stress during that time. The number of banks on the FDIC's ""problem list"" increased by four to 43, and assets held by banks on that list rose to $58 billion.

Banks on the problem list typically have multiple weaknesses identified by regulators in confidential supervisory ratings and can be seized and shut down unless the issues are resolved quickly.

What was also clear from the FDIC's new report is that the industry became less profitable during the first quarter as interest rates rose and depositors began moving their money elsewhere. The outflows forced many banks start paying more to keep depositors or attract them back.

Those higher costs, in turn, cut into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits.

The FDIC said that margin declined by 7 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.31 percent, as the cost of deposits for banks rose faster than the yield banks earned on their loans.

Loan yields increased 32 basis points during the quarter to 6.08% while deposits increased 43 basis points to 1.42%.

All of those changes cut into overall profits, which declined 17% for all FDIC-insured institutions during the first quarter.

""The banking industry continues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, slower economic growth, and geopolitical uncertainty,"" Gruenberg said.

""Credit quality and profitability may weaken due to these risks and may result in a further tightening of loan underwriting, slower loan growth higher provision expenses and liquidity constraints,"" he added, citing challenges for commercial real estate loans backed by office properties.""

""These will be matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.""

‚ÄúMeaningful deposit outflows have not yet materialized, but banks will need to watch these trends carefully as the interest rate environment evolves,‚Äù Gruenberg said.

‚ÄúMost banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUnrealized losses on securities have meaningfully reduced the reported equity capital of the banking industry.‚Äù

An unrealized loss or gain describes the value of an asset that has yet to be sold.

‚ÄúThe total of these unrealized losses, including securities that are available for sale or held to maturity, was about $620 billion at year-end 2022,‚Äù Gruenberg told the Institute of International Bankers on March 6.

‚ÄúThe current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks‚Äô funding and investment strategies,‚Äù Gruenberg told lobbyists last week.

On Monday, shares of regional banks were getting hammered in early trades as fears about their liquidity persisted, even as the Fed and President Biden doubled down on reassurances that depositors would be protected.

Shares of First Republic Bank plunged 76%. PacWest Bancorp‚Äôs stock price was down by 44% while Western Alliance Bancorp shares plummeted 79%.

Charles Schwab‚Äôs stock price fell by some 17% on Monday while Bank of America shares shed around 4%.

JPMorgan warned in November that SVB was vulnerable due to ‚Äú$16 billion in unrealized losses,‚Äù according to an analysis reviewed by The Post on Sunday.

A week before the comments from FDIC‚Äôs Gruenberg, Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, which gauges credit ratings and provides risk assessment to investors in the capital markets, downgraded Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs credit.

SVB then tried to sell $2 billion worth of its investments at a loss in hopes of shoring up its balance sheet ‚Äî fueling alarm among investors and triggering a run on the bank.

SVB, which until recently was the nation‚Äôs 16th largest bank with $209 billion in assets under management, had gained a reputation on Wall Street as the go-to financial lender for thousands of venture capital firms and tech startups.

In 2021, VC-backed firms raised some $330 billion ‚Äî which was double the amount raised during the previous year.

With interest rates at extremely low levels at the time, tech companies were awash in cheap cash.

They deposited the money with lenders including SVB, which then turned around and invested the cash into long-term mortgage backed securities and bonds.

When the Fed hiked interest rates, however, the value of those investments plummeted.
‚Ä¢ Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could alter the course of American innovation: sources

Given the falling revenues in the technology sector in recent months, the bank struggled to plug the gaping hole in its balance sheet.

Regulators in California and Gruenberg‚Äôs FDIC stepped in and shut down SVB once depositors panicked and tried to get their money out.

The reverberations of SVB‚Äôs collapse were felt over the weekend, when regulators closed down Signature Bank, the real estate lender which had been heavily invested in the struggling cryptocurrency sector.

The Federal Reserve said it will create a new Bank Term Funding Program to offer depository institutions loans of up to one year, backed by US Treasury securities and other assets, to help the banks.

Earnings per share for the six biggest U.S. banks are expected to be down about 10% from a year earlier, analyst estimates from Refinitiv I/B/E/S show. Banks start reporting results on April 14.

Access to cheap deposits, which swelled for bigger banks as savers fled smaller lenders in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse last month, likely boosted net interest income for the largest banks, analysts said.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, is likely to come out ahead of the pack as its net interest margin - interest earned on loans versus interest paid to depositors - was higher than some of its peers, analysts said.

The bank is expected to report a 30% rise in EPS, buoyed by an almost 36% increase in net interest income, according the Refinitiv I/B/E/S estimates and Reuters calculations.

However, tighter financial conditions and a slowing economy mean banks face the prospect of tepid loan growth and souring credit, forcing them to add to provisions against potential losses.

""We expect a challenging earnings season for the banks,"" said David Chiaverini, banking analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note.

He said bank managements will become more defensive, implementing liquidity measures that could lead to downward revisions for net interest income.

Profits are also likely to be hit by another dry spell for deals and capital markets activity, and some analysts are predicting a slowdown in trading revenue as well. These trends would especially hit investment banking powerhouses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).

Trading income, a silver lining in the previous quarters, could suffer from lower equities trading in the first quarter versus a year earlier, partially offset by strength in fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC), analysts said.

Goldman's earnings per share could fall by a fifth, hurt by investment banking woes, after a bigger-than-expected 69% drop in fourth-quarter profit, hurt by wealth management revenue and consumer business losses.

The six banks declined to comment on upcoming results and forecasts.

The S&P 500 bank index (.SPXBK) is down 14% year-to-date.

As interest rates rise, banks make more money on borrowers' interest payments than they pay out to depositors.

Net interest income for the six biggest U.S. banks are expected to be up about 30% from a year earlier, according to analyst estimates from Refinitiv I/B/E/S.

However, gains from interest payments may be offset by bad loans.

""There will still be incremental increases in provisions coming in this year,"" particularly for commercial real estate and potentially consumer credit cards, said Ana Arsov, head of the North American banking team at rating agency Moody's Investors Service.

She expects a lending slowdown in areas such as commercial and industrials, autos and mortgages.

Investors will scrutinize balance sheets to determine which lenders attracted or lost deposits during the March banking crisis, while assessing its impact on lending and the U.S. economy.

The results will give a snapshot of how readily lenders can fund operations and whether they have enough cushion to handle shocks.

""The fears over bank capital and liquidity levels are likely to persist for at least the next few months because of the recent stresses,"" Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. interest rate strategist at TD Securities, said in an interview.

The combined strike of actors and writers in Hollywood is entering its second week. It's already seen Tina Fey, Kevin Bacon, David Duchovny, and other stars join performers and creators on the picket lines.

Unions for United Parcel Service (UPS) and Detroit's so-called 'Big Three' automakers are poised to join them in coming weeks if contract negotiations fall through ‚Äî and neither of these scenarios is a long shot.

Bank of America's auto analyst John Murphy has put the odds of an autoworker strike at 'better than 90 percent.' UPS has only 10 days left to cut a deal with the Teamsters union before a July 31 deadline for downing tools.

For many analysts, the US, and other western nations are witnessing a resurgence of long-dormant industrial action, as unionists seize the opportunities of a tight labor market to push bosses for better pay and benefits.

University of California labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein told Bloomberg this was the 'biggest moment of striking since the 1970s' as union chiefs found their nerve and went 'on the offense.'

Some 65,000 actors and 11,500 screenwriters are on strike over pay, healthcare benefits, and protection from artificial intelligence, shuttering TV and movie sets in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago and beyond.

It's not clear when negotiations between their unions, SAG-AFTRA and the Writers' Guild, and the studios and streaming companies, which are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, will resume.

The group says they've already offered writers and actors better pay and perks.

UPS bosses said this week they would return to the bargaining table with a better offer for roughly 340,000 Teamsters-represented US workers.

They're keen to avoid a strike that could cost the company $7 billion in just 10 days, according to one estimate.

It could also upend parcel deliveries to millions of Americans.

Talks broke down on July 5 over disagreements on wages for experienced part-time workers, some of whom make less than new hires because starting wages jumped due to the labor shortage in the last few years.

He said they had the 'power' to decide whether they showed up to work and would win bigger paychecks by 'sticking together.'

In a statement, UPS bosses said they were prepared to raise their 'industry-leading pay and benefits' and talks are set to continue next week.

President Joe Biden met this week with Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers (UAW), which represents 150,000 US hourly workers at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, to discuss a looming strike.

Contracts between the union and the Big Three carmakers are set to expire in September.

Fain has slammed their record profits and efforts to move manufacturing abroad.

Still, action across all three makers at the same time is unlikely, analyst say.

'We just have to see where things go,' Fain said.

For their part, the carmakers say they already offer good wages and perks, and must remain competitive against lower-paying rivals, like Elon Musk's Tesla, as they pump money into next-generation electric vehicles.

In Hollywood, studio bosses have their own cashflow problems thanks to the switch to streaming, which is less lucrative.

Likewise, UPS has struggled with demand as the US emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.

How the negotiations play out could set a precedent for workers, unions, and bosses for the coming years.

If unions triumph, it will send a message to workers at companies like Amazon and Starbucks, which have resisted unionization, that they can unite and put pressure on executives.

It would also mark a turnaround for organized labor, which has seen membership collapse in recent decades.

In the early 1980s, fully one fifth of America's private sector was unionized, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's fallen to barely 6 percent nowadays.

The biggest actions in US history ‚Äî including the Steel Strike of half a million workers in 1959 and the 400,000 railroad shop workers who downed tools in 1922 ‚Äî appeared to be in the rearview mirror.

In their recent book Union Booms and Busts, Judith Stepan-Norris and Jasmine Kerrissey, count 1974 as the peak year for labor actions, with 6,074 separate strikes across the US.

Union leaders were tamed as the courts became more hostile to them in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan.

Strikes started ending with fewer gains for workers, and union membership fell.

That's why many analysts see the 2023 as a turning point for laborers, who are flexing their muscles even as global supply chains and automation should be putting more power in the hands of employers.

'Never forget this: Working people outnumber the billionaires and CEOs by a huge margin,' said Robert Reich, a University of California, Berkeley, professor and Carter-era labor secretary.

Utilities are planning their biggest spending increases in decades to replace aging equipment, prepare for a surge in power demand driven by electric-vehicle adoption and strengthen their systems to withstand severe weather patterns linked to climate change. Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group, expects that utilities will invest roughly $159 billion in 2023 and $155 billion in 2024, more than any year since 2000, when the group began tracking spending.

Utility spending is generally low-risk and lucrative because regulators allow the companies to earn set rates of return on investments in power lines, and, in some cases, power plants. That isn‚Äôt the case for spending on unregulated businesses, including portfolios of renewables or conventional power plants that operate in competitive power markets throughout the U.S.

Duke in June announced plans to sell about 3,400 megawatts of wind, solar and battery projects to Brookfield Renewable for $2.8 billion. Brian Savoy, Duke‚Äôs chief financial officer, said the sale would help the company finance its capital-spending plan, which proposes $145 billion in investments over the next decade.

Savoy said the company, which supplies electricity in the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, is working to assess what upgrades are needed to account for more electric vehicles and the prospect of more severe hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding.

‚ÄúOur utility growth plans just continue to expand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of work that needs to be done on the grid.‚Äù

The company is also building some renewable projects under its regulated businesses.

AEP, which supplies power in parts of 11 states in the Midwest and South, earlier this year agreed to sell 1,365 megawatts of renewable-energy projects, mostly wind farms, to a consortium of infrastructure investors. The company said it expects to net $1.2 billion on the sale.

Chief Executive Julie Sloat said AEP plans to invest roughly $40 billion in its utility businesses in the next five years. The sale, she said, will help the company reduce financial risk and manage the extent to which customers have to foot the bill.

‚ÄúHow are we going to fund all of that, and keep rates as low as possible for our customers?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are other companies that are probably better suited to own unregulated assets.‚Äù

The sales come as the competitive renewables sector becomes more challenging to navigate amid rising interest rates and an increase in the number of project developers seeking to supply power at the lowest cost. Supply-chain snarls and inflation have lately made projects more expensive to build.

‚ÄúWhen competition picks up, margins start to erode,‚Äù said Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza. ‚ÄúThe valuations of these businesses have deteriorated over time.‚Äù

Duke recorded nearly $1.5 billion in impairment charges in recent months as it wrote down the value of its renewables portfolio, which it once pegged at $4 billion.

Still, large developers see opportunity, in part because of a suite of tax credits available through the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year.

German energy company RWE this year bought ConEd‚Äôs renewables business for $6.8 billion. The acquisition nearly doubled its U.S. portfolio to more than 8 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery projects, with more than 24 gigawatts in the development pipeline. ConEd serves New York City, other parts of New York state and areas of New Jersey.

Mark Noyes, chief executive of RWE Clean Energy, said the company expects strong and consistent market conditions for the next 10 to 13 years because of the Inflation Reduction Act.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing the opposite of utilities. We‚Äôre growing,‚Äù he said, adding that if utilities were to keep the unregulated renewables portfolios, it would require them to spend increasing amounts of capital outside of their core business.

Jehangir Vevaina, managing partner in Brookfield‚Äôs renewable power and transition group, said developers are better positioned for that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right in our wheelhouse,‚Äù he said, adding that Brookfield can retrofit and update existing plants, add battery storage to some projects and ‚Äúoptimize them on a commercial basis, but then also develop the assets in the pipeline and bring them to fruition,‚Äù he said.

Brookfield sees growing interest from commercial and industrial customers willing to sign power-purchase contracts that support the development of renewables. Many companies have set ambitious carbon-reduction targets that depend in part on buying clean power.

Vevaina said the companies are willing to pay more to account for the recent increase in development costs. The Duke deal, Brookfield‚Äôs latest in the U.S., included about 6 gigawatts of operating assets and slightly more than that of projects in development.

‚ÄúThese companies are trying to hit their net-zero targets,‚Äù Vevaina said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs strong demand for good projects in the right locations.‚Äù

Plunging margins for petrochemicals are set to take a bite out of Big Oil‚Äôs quarterly profits, adding to the pain companies are feeling from lower oil and gas prices.

Sluggish demand for consumer goods that use plastics and rubber, combined with a flood of new chemical factories in the US and China, means margins in the sector face a potentially protracted downturn.

The slump, which the CEO of Cologne-based Lanxness AG called a ‚ÄúLehman 2‚Äù moment for the chemical industry, has cast a dark cloud over a sector long-touted as the future of fossil fuels. Over the past five years, Exxon Mobil Corp., Shell Plc, and TotalEnergies SE have invested heavily in US petrochemical plants that turn cheap gas feedstocks unleashed by the shale boom into the building blocks for everything from electronics to building materials to household appliances.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pretty dramatic downturn,‚Äù said Joseph Chang, a New York-based analyst at ICIS, an industry consultant and data provider. ‚ÄúWith chemicals oversupplied right now, large oil companies will find other areas to invest in.‚Äù

Big Oil may be insulated from the worst of the bloodbath because it‚Äôs still a relatively small part of their global oil and gas operations. But a structural deterioration in chemicals adds to headwinds already facing crude, trading and refining markets. Overall earnings for Exxon, Shell, TotalEnergies and BP Plc will likely drop for a second straight quarter, mainly driven by lower oil and gas prices, as well as refining margins, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

On Sunday, Chevron Corp. posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings as output in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico soared to a record. The company also said it waived the mandatory retirement age for Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth. While adjusted earnings were higher than analysts expected, net income dropped to $6 billion. It‚Äôs the fourth-straight quarter of lower results for Chevron.

Still, the oil majors‚Äô balance sheets remain ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, mostly with low debt and surplus cash, RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said. But if commodity prices move lower, so could shareholder returns next year, he said.

Analysts have been trimming estimates for Exxon and Shell since they released guidance earlier this month that warned of lower refining and trading earnings. In particular, Shell said its gas trading division ‚Äî which boosted the company‚Äôs profits to historical highs earlier this year ‚Äî will fall back in line to average levels.

With those statements largely priced in ‚Äî and oil already rebounding early in the third quarter ‚Äî the potential for prolonged weakness in the often-overlooked petrochemical market is becoming a pressing concern.

Petrochemicals play two vital roles in Big Oil‚Äôs operations. They‚Äôre a hedge when oil and gas prices drop. And they offer growth rates forecast to eventually eclipse crude demand, which many analysts project will plateau or decline in the decade ahead as nations push to phase out fossil fuels. Exxon and Shell started up giant chemical plants in Texas and Pennsylvania last year, producing plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene, for which there are few green alternatives.

The short-term outlook is challenging: Exxon and Shell aren‚Äôt the only ones vying for a piece of the petrochemical pie.

Some 49.5 million tons of new ethylene capacity has or will come online globally from 2020 to 2024, outstripping projected demand by 55%, according to S&P Global. More than half is coming from China, which wants to reduce imports of chemicals key to its manufacturing industry, the world‚Äôs biggest.

Read More: A Glut of Made-in-China Plastic Will Dent Oil‚Äôs Growth Machine

And there‚Äôs more to come. At least a dozen giant new facilities are being built or are due to start construction over the next four years, with an additional 9.5 million tons coming online from 2025 to 2030. Three new plants in the US and Canada will increase North American polyethylene production by 13% this year alone, according to ICIS.

Demand is failing to keep up. High interest rates are weakening economic growth. Many consumers who are spending are opting to travel, go to restaurants or take other outings instead of buying durable goods, Chang said. A weaker-than-expected Chinese recovery and lower usage of disposable masks and medical equipment related to Covid-19 is also weighing on the sector.

Chemical producers including FMC Corp. , Ashland Inc. and Olin Corp. have warned of substantially lower profits for the rest of this year.

Still, Big Oil is far from being in crisis mode. Combined earnings of Exxon, Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies and BP will be $29.5 billion in the second quarter. That‚Äôs 23% lower than first three months of the year but still more than double the quarterly average from 2015 to 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

With lower earnings this quarter, all five companies will face questions about whether they can maintain the generous promises made last year when profits soared to record highs to reward shareholders with big dividends and buybacks.

Lower earnings will ‚Äúinevitably have a negative impact on distributions‚Äù for the European majors who linked their shareholder return targets to cash flow, Kim Fustier, a London-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in a note. But Exxon and Chevron should be able to ‚Äúsustain current buybacks for longer‚Äù due to their lower debt ratios, she said.

            Authored by Simon White, Bloomberg macro strategist,

Regional banks in the US have been outperforming their larger counterparts this month, but that is likely to soon reverse as their larger exposure to real-estate becomes a hindrance.

Perhaps counter-intuitively it has been the larger US banks that have been hit the hardest after the collapse of SVB and Signature bank.

Reasons cited have included greater exposure to Credit Suisse and expectation of more regulation on the way.

Systematic selling has also not helped as investors jettisoned bank stocks, fearing the crisis could be become systemic.



But there are several reasons to believe that larger banks will soon begin outperforming again.

Deposits at US banks at the aggregate level have fallen since last summer. Yet total bank balance-sheets have barely declined as banks ramped up their loan-to-deposit ratios (LTDRs).

However, digging under the surface, it has been the smaller banks who have done most of the lending.

Their LTDR has risen 11% points since late 2021, versus 7% points for large banks, while their total assets have risen over $300 billion over the same period, while larger banks‚Äô assets have fallen by $400bn.

This extra lending has been in consumer loans, but most of the rise has been in real-estate loans ‚Äì residential and commercial.



This is a potential problem for smaller banks. They remain prone to deposit flight in the wake of SVB, with larger banks already attracting billions of dollars.

SVB was slightly unusual among the smaller banks in that it had a large fixed-income portfolio, its plummeting value the death warrant for the bank. In response, the Fed has unleashed another acronym on the financial world ‚Äì the BTFP (Bank Term Funding Program) ‚Äì where banks can repo in Treasuries and agency securities for up to a year at par.

But the smaller banks have a lot more residential and commercial real-estate on their books relative to the larger banks. 

They therefore have a greater proportion of assets that are not ‚Äúshiftable‚Äù onto the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet - ultimately this is a greater stress on their liquidity.



Deposit rates will soon rise for small and large banks, and this may have more of an impact on larger banks‚Äô profitability to begin with.

But they may not need to raise them as much as they continue to soak up small-bank deposit migration.

Furthermore, large banks are cheaper on a P/E and P/B basis (comparing the BKX index with the KBW regional bank index).

Although sales were up, the grocery industry experienced $298 million in margin loss on their digital grocery business. Consequently, Amazon planned to lay off 18,000 workers, added fees to once-free food deliveries and terminated a warehouse expansion.

With tight profit margins and rising inflation, Ocado saw a 3.8% loss due to reduced basket value and investments in capacity for future growth. As stores look to boost customer service, they take two different fulfillment approaches: One scales down to minimize spending, and the other expands to create space for streamlined logistics.

Fulfillment is the most costly part of e-grocery, but now that customers have had a taste for e-commerce, there's no going back. What can grocers do to remain competitive? Let's take a look.

Today‚Äôs challenges start with customers wanting groceries in a couple of hours. Grocers must deliver perishables and frozen foods quickly and also under the right conditions (so for longer journeys, that's not in a car). This leaves 70% of grocers fulfilling e-grocery requests in brick-and-mortar locations, as cited by Grocery Drive in 2023.

The most prominent industry complaint is product unavailability. In fact, 45% of customers expressed concern about out-of-stock items, with many of their preferred products frequently unavailable, according to The Food Industry Association‚Äôs 2022 US Grocery Shopper Trends report. That's why grocers must get their local inventory in check to keep prices low and customers happy.

For store fulfillment to work well, grocers need to keep inventory accurate‚Äîand reflect this accuracy in online stores. Smaller retailers that use their store products to fulfill online orders must centralize on- and offline sales data and check this daily to ensure they replace each purchase, whether made online or in-store.

One way to ensure retailers can fulfill all orders when items fly off the shelves is to update online stores with stockouts quickly. If it is not automated, then ""order success"" captains should be able to change the status in real-time with delay easily.

An effective substitution rule is another way to alleviate stockout issues. Grocers can indicate this logic if an item is not available. The final measure is communicating stockouts and replacements with customers via mobile app notifications, SMS or phone.

Set Up Stores With Designated Areas For Perishable, Frozen And Chilled Items

Larger corporations use micro-fulfillment centers (MFCs) like Instacart, Kroger and Ocado, who just invested in a new one. With automation, pallet forklifts and layouts designed specifically for online orders, grocers can pick, pack and fulfill much faster than traditional manual methods.

However, others are shutting down MFCs because they are a significant capital investment. And the customer doesn't pay the driver for a return trip, meaning long drives to out-of-the-way MFCs are another cost for retailers to absorb.

Instead, smaller retailers with fewer than 100 orders may organize a dedicated section in their existing fridge and freezer. Nevertheless, for mid-to-large-sized grocers, the leg work from running to each chilled, frozen and temperate aisle once the customer arrives may also cause delays and frustrations for staff and shoppers alike. And the bags could be located like a jigsaw.

Therefore, grocers need a designated area near the entrance with a labeling system for customers, goods, bags and packing stations. For instance, customer A has three bags across each section. When the driver comes, they know to collect bags X, Y and Z from stations 1, 2 and 3. Depending on the size of your store, organizing shelves by the hour of the collection could also help efficiency.

Equip Order-Success Captains With the Tools They Need

Are the orders ready for the driver? Has the inventory been updated in the system? Did staff take orders correctly and put them in the right location? Or is the store receiving customer complaints? While each team member, from the packer to the driver, has their KPIs, someone must always be on hand to oversee the whole process. This is where barcodes that talk to central systems are essential.

Barcodes and corresponding hardware are affordable and great for tracking orders, inventory and misplacements. While grocers can use a mobile app to scan items, the handheld barcode scanner is the most efficient and productive. The good news is that today, these devices can talk to mobile apps, minimizing the need for additional hardware. Meaning ""order-success"" captains can receive all the updates they need from their phones.

Already, when staff members receive online customer orders, they look at their phones. They ‚Äúpick‚Äù the can of tomato sauce and scan the item and the packaging destination so the system knows the team member has it. What's more, standard picking software alerts them if they identify an incorrect product for that bag's destination. While integrating the system with mobile devices allows ""order-success"" captains to oversee alerts and review the process alongside customer feedback.

To go one step further, stores can create virtual shelves and staging areas by entering the exact location codes and store setup into online spreadsheets or grocery-picking mobile apps. By automating the cross-checking between staging location codes, customer reference numbers, order data and delivery destination, stores can create apps that help staff know where to place and pick products.

The bottom line is that without converting a store into a warehouse, there are things you can do with existing technology to be more efficient. But stores must rethink their layout to coexist online orders with the main store. Plan smart, create a human role for each process stage and let technology help you.

Layoffs have officially arrived in the retail sector.

Since the start of 2023, major retailers ranging from department stores to direct-to-consumer brands have cut staff, the latest swing in a sector that's been hit hard by labor challenges and inflation.

Most of the cuts so far have impacted corporate retail employees. At a store level, many retailers are actually holding tighter to workers than usual, even seasonal employees, in a practice economists call ""labor hoarding."" Still, less than two months into the year, over a dozen companies have already announced layoffs impacting hundreds, sometimes thousands of employees.

Here are the retailers who have announced layoffs in 2023:
‚Ä¢ Walmart: The big box store chain will close two stores in Portland, Oregon, resulting in 480 layoffs, according to documents filed with the state. The company is also closing three tech hubs in Texas, Oregon, and California and offering those employees the option to relocate to its Arkansas headquarters or accept a severance package
‚Ä¢ The RealReal: The luxury consignment company will cut 230 employees, about 7% of its workforce.
‚Ä¢ Lidl: Around 200 US-based corporate employees are being let go from the German grocery chain.
‚Ä¢ Neiman Marcus: The high-end department store is cutting 5% of staff amid a ""strategic realignment to accelerate high value luxury customer growth.""

‚Ä¢ Stitch Fix: About 20% of the brand's salaried workforce of 1,700 employees were cut in January amid slowing sales and a shrinking customer base.
‚Ä¢ Everlane: 17% of the direct-to-consumer clothing brand's corporate staff and less than 3% of retail workforce were cut in an effort to ""improve profitability in 2023.""
‚Ä¢ Wayfair: The online home goods retailer cut 1,750 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce in January. The majority of the layoffs, about 1,200 positions, were corporate employees in an effort to ""eliminate management layers and reorganize to be more agile,"" Wayfair said.
‚Ä¢ Saks.com: At least 100 positions were eliminated at the e-commerce branch of Saks Fifth Avenue, or about 3.5% of its staff. Saks Off 5th's e-commerce site also conducted layoffs, though it's unclear how many workers were impacted.

One side is wrong. There is a huge divergence that has developed between energy stocks and crude oil. Crude oil is 40% below its peak in March of this year, yet energy stocks are far and away the best performing sector in the S & P this year, up 62% and only 4% off the highs it hit a few weeks ago. Why the huge disparity? Energy bulls insist supplies will remain tight and oil prices will likely be higher in 2023. ""Our belief is the market will recognize we have an oil supply problem and they will buy service [stocks]...the next phase is the market realization is that we are short oil and we need oil, and to us that is an oil service trade,"" Paul Sankey of Sankey Research said on our air November 18th. ""There is clearly an oil scarcity thesis that has emerged among investors, who are piling into the sector, despite clear indications of relative over supply and lower oil prices ahead,"" John Kilduff from Again Capital told me. David Meats, who covers energy stocks at Morningstar, agreed: ""The logic is investors think oil markets will remain tight indefinitely,"" he told me. Still, there is considerable debate about oil prices in 2023. On the demand side, many believe the global economy will contract in 2023. On the supply side, not everyone agrees there is a scarcity problem. ""Imagine the price setup if the several problem producing countries were somehow rehabilitated: Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Libya, and Nigeria,"" Kilduff told me. ""More supply is in the process of coming online from Brazil and Guyana, and you saw that the Biden administration is allowing Chevron back in to Venezuela."" Finally, when all else fails, there is the hope among bulls that OPEC will ride to the rescue. ""I think that the equities are looking, perhaps hoping, that OPEC+ will continue with its proactive stance of cutting production when necessary, in order to support higher oil prices,"" oil analyst Andy Lipow told me. So who's winning? For the moment, it looks like the bulls are winning: Energy stock prices remain elevated, suggesting investors are optimistic about 2023. ""The P/Es of most of the oil companies remain attractive, on a valuation basis, especially if you believe demand will ramp up and take oil prices with it next year,"" Kilduff told me. One additional wildcard: China. Whether China reopens or remains subject to variable lockdowns could have a big effect on oil prices. Variable dividends Lower oil prices are not just a threat to profits: many oil companies have instituted variable dividends, where the variable portion of the payouts are dependent on cash flow. Companies with a variable dividend include Pioneer (PXD), ConocoPhillips (COP), Devon Energy (DVN), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Coterra Energy (CTRA). These companies, for the most part, are in a sub-set of the Energy space: exploration & production. This makes sense, since these companies are the ones most exposed to oil prices. Diamondback Energy, for example, has a yearly base dividend of $3 per share, but has announced additional ""variable"" dividends each quarter this year: Diamondback Energy (variable dividend announcement) November 8: $1.51 August 3: $2.30 May 3: $2.35 Variable dividends have an obvious advantage for companies: They can easily reduce the variable portion of the dividend should cash flows change. Investors have little room to complain if that happens, because that portion of the dividend is ""variable."" This takes a lot of pressure off of companies. Other big players in the energy space, like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, pay relatively high fixed dividends. They are under constant pressure to maintain those relatively high dividends whether cash flows are strong or not. Companies with variable dividends have more flexibility. The downside: No one is sure what the total payout (the fixed dividend plus the ""variable"" dividend) will be from quarter to quarter. ""They [variable dividends] are very much at risk at $75 [for oil] and the decline in oil prices drops right to a companies bottom line profitability (all other things being equal).

A group of House Democrats, joined by officials from climate action advocacy groups, announced a series of forthcoming proposals Wednesday, some of which have also been introduced in the Senate, including:
‚Ä¢ New carbon emission standards, including making Michigan carbon-neutral for electricity generation by 2035
‚Ä¢ Directing utility companies to provide more energy efficiency programs for low-income customers
‚Ä¢ Requiring state regulators to hold public hearings in communities affected by adverse weather events

Some of the goals targeted by the new legislation were outlined in the ""MI Healthy Climate Plan"" unveiled last year by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But while Whitmer's plan called for carbon neutrality by 2050, lawmakers are accelerating that goal, pointing to 2035 as a target for a zero-emission standard. A bill outlining a carbon free standard by 2035 was also introduced in the state Senate earlier this year.

In terms of energy production, carbon neutrality generally means getting carbon emissions as close to zero as possible, and then using various ""offsets"" ‚Äî projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as planting trees or increased efficiencies at power plants ‚Äî to address the remainder.

Rep. Betsy Coffia, D-Traverse City, said her proposal would create new standards for Michigan's renewable energy generation in the years leading up to 2035 ‚Äî from 2027 to 2029, the state's standard for renewable energy usage would be 40%, rising to 60% by 2030 before the ultimate goal of a carbon-free energy standard by 2035.

Lawmakers say it's past time for policy action on climate change, pointing to recent weather events that have affected the state.

""This is truly a pivotal moment in Michigan's future as it relates to energy,"" said Rep. Rachel Hood, D-Grand Rapids. Hood has introduced legislation to facilitate the creation of community solar facilities and reserve a portion of the energy produced by the facilities for low-income households and community organizations.

""Thanks to an influx of funding from the federal government that can now go towards clean energy and green infrastructure, we have a unique opportunity to build out a solar, very low-cost state,"" Hood added, referencing the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022, which establishes tax credits for residents and businesses who seek to switch to solar.

Earlier in June, the air quality index (AQI) reached levels considered unsafe for the general public after smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted south and blanketed parts of Michigan, most evidently in Detroit. At one point, Detroit had the second worst AQI in the world among major cities, only better than New Delhi, India.

Hot, dry conditions at the start of June also contributed to a 2,400 acre wildfire in Crawford County, near Grayling, Michigan Department of Natural Resources officials said.

And at the other end of the thermometer, a severe ice storm in late February left around 700,000 customers in Michigan without power between the state's two major electric utilities, many of which who went days without access to electricity. The world's changing climate is a contributing factor to extreme weather events, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Detroit-based DTE Energy CEO Jerry Norcia has said the company expects to have to deal with multiple severe weather events annually.

Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, D-Livonia, noted that for many, losing power for consecutive days meant losing groceries and breast milk without a working refrigerator, as well as access to necessary medical equipment. Pohutsky said her legislation would require the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, to hold hearings in communities affected by power outages.

Lawmakers say the bills were crafted to ensure that low-income and marginalized groups in Michigan receive a ""just"" outcome as the state shifts towards a carbon-neutral future. Rep. Abraham Aiyash, D-Hamtramck, said his bill would require electricity and natural gas providers to spend portions of their energy efficiency programs on low-income communities, specifically.

Additionally, Aiyash said as utility companies expand their workforces to meet new renewable energy generation demands, his legislation would encourage them to place a focus on hiring individuals from low-income communities, which are typically associated with higher energy costs.

""These changes will increase efficiency, affordability and accessibility for Michigan's utility customers while also ensuring that we are creating good paying jobs across the state as we move to a cleaner and more just Michigan,"" Aiyash said.

Legislative changes:Detroit could fight officer exodus to suburbs ‚Äî by charging them to leave

Should lawmakers be able to advance any of the proposed zero-emission standards, Michigan would have some of the most aggressive carbon neutrality goals in the U.S. Only Rhode Island, with a carbon-free goal of 2033, would have a faster zero emissions target, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance.

Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the carbon free goal ‚Äî House Energy, Communications and Technology Minority Vice Chair Pauline Wendzel, R-Watervliet, said in an April statement that moving to a completely carbon neutral standard by 2035 would be too quick to meet Michigan's current energy demands. But Democratic majorities in both chambers could render GOP opposition to any climate-related legislation ineffective.

While carbon neutrality bills in either chamber are yet to receive formal committee hearings, some proposals related to climate change are moving through the Legislature ‚Äî on Wednesday, the Senate voted 20-18 to send money generated by air pollution fines to the communities affected by said pollution. The bill, which still has to be taken up the House, would also direct the Michigan Department of Energy, Great Lakes and Environment to identify these ""environmental justice communities.""","As severe weather events mount, Michigan lawmakers say climate legislation is overdue",non-causal,"AQI, DTE, GOP, CEO, MI",[],"['S', 'U']","['DTE', 'AQI', 'MI', 'CEO', 'GOP']","['U', 'DTE', 'S', 'AQI', 'MI', 'CEO', 'GOP']",-0.9854226

After totaling just $8 billion in Q1 2023, M&A transactions cited by EIR during Q2 came to triple that number, accompanied by a revived focus on the acquisition of drilling positions in the prolific Permian Basin of west Texas and southeast New Mexico.

‚ÄúThe second quarter saw a thunderous return to Permian M&A after a relatively quiet start to the year,‚Äù said Andrew Dittmar, director at Enverus. ‚ÄúThe need for public buyers to secure quality drilling inventory has been brewing, and the pressure to make a deal has been mounting as the remaining opportunities are narrowed with each successive transaction. That in turn is driving higher valuations on the remaining assets.‚Äù

In an interview this week, Dittmar told me that, while what he called ‚Äúinteresting opportunities‚Äù for future deals in other shale basins remain, the superior quality and quantity of rock and the lower breakeven prices that sets up were the main reasons why focus returned to the Permian following a first quarter that saw multiple deals in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas. ‚ÄúWe classify prospects that break even at less than $50 WTI as being tier one,‚Äù Dittmar says. ‚ÄúSo, if you want to have that quality of inventory, there's really just not a lot of places you can buy it outside the Permian.‚Äù

One place outside the Permian where Chevron went shopping during the 2nd quarter is the Denver Julesburg (DJ) Basin. Chevron has long been a prominent player in the DJ and decided to increase its position there with the biggest deal of the quarter, a $7.6 billion takeover of PDC Energy. Dittmar made clear his assessment that the PDC portfolio is filled with tier one prospects.

‚ÄúThe rock in the DJ looks fantastic,‚Äù Dittmar says. ‚ÄúDefinitely sub-$50 break evens, even into the low forties in some cases. We think Chevron was able to get a pretty good deal on PDC. It‚Äôs paying well less than $1 million per location, whereas inventory of that quality in the Permian would cost you significantly more than that.‚Äù

Civitas Resources, with its splash entry into the Permian Basin via a pair of $2 billion+ buyouts of TapRock Resources and Hibernia Energy III, presents another interesting case given its status as a pure-play DJ Basin producer to this point. ‚ÄúWe like the TapRock deal a little bit better, both in terms of where the valuation landed and the underlying quality of the asset,‚Äù Dittmar says. ‚ÄúWe think that the best of the TapRock assets are going to be the very best that Civitas has going forward. So, while the DJ actually has very good rock, that tier one Delaware stuff is just another league in terms of the quality. Hibernia in the Southern Midland was maybe a little bit more expensive than we've seen some deals in terms of that asset quality price. You‚Äôre taking a step towards the margin of the basin there on the southern side.‚Äù

Having said that, Dittmar also says he thinks the margins of the Permian region could hold a good deal of upside potential for buyers. ‚ÄúOne of the stories we're seeing in the Permian Basin is that there's the locations you think are there based on existing wells and proven results, and then there's the locations that no one has tried that on bench in that area yet. So geologically, it looks like it has a lot of potential. I think that‚Äôs why some of these buyers are moving towards the margins of the basin.‚Äù

When asked if he foresees more consolidation coming to the U.S. shale business, Dittmar‚Äôs answer was unequivocal. ‚ÄúThere's still too many public companies out there - I think that's been a consensus in shale since the get-go, almost,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd the more consolidated industry makes sense from a strategic perspective. It makes sense for investors. You have lower G&A (general and administrative) costs. We're better able to tackle the regulatory and environmental concerns. So, I think we do need to see more consolidation in the industry.‚Äù

This most recent quarter‚Äôs M&A activity displays a continuation of several long-term factors impacting the U.S. shale space: Increased consolidation with a focus on lower costs, enhancing economies of scale, raising the acquiring company‚Äôs inventory of tier one drilling locations, creating free cash flow, and improving returns to investors.

As Dittmar notes, these have really been the overriding goals that have driven consolidation in the shale sector since the shale revolution began in earnest in the first years of this century, and there seems little reason to expect these drivers to shift in the coming years.",Oil And Gas Merger Action Surges After A Dormant First Quarter,non-causal,"III, PDC, EIR, DJ, WTI","['M', 'DJ', 'U', 'S', 'EIR', 'PDC', 'A', 'III']","['S', 'M', 'A', 'U']","['III', 'DJ', 'EIR', 'PDC', 'WTI']","['M', 'DJ', 'U', 'WTI', 'S', 'EIR', 'CVX', 'PDC', 'A', 'III']",-0.5964823

            The memory chip sector, typically a volatile and cyclical sector, is in the midst of yet another rout.

But as Bloomberg noted this week, this rout wasn't supposed to happen. For years we had heard that the sector would eventually calm down and even out - and that volatility wouldn't be as pronounced due to steadier demand for things like 5G and cloud services.



Just months after a historic semiconductor shortage, there's a ""glut of the chips sitting in warehouses"" at the same time that customers are paring back on orders. We first identified the whipsaw in semiconductors all the way back in October 2022, which you can read about here. 

Avril Wu, senior research vice president at TrendForce told Bloomberg this week: ‚ÄúThe chip industry thought that suppliers were going to have better control. This downturn has proved everybody was wrong.‚Äù



The report notes that the very same consumers who were keen to spend their stimulus money on things like cars and electronics during the pandemic, items which necessitate semiconductors, are now ""holding off on big purchases as they cope with inflation and rising interest rates"". And the pullback in demand comes just as semi companies sought to increase supply to try and deal with the shortages. 

Companies like Samsung are now ""losing money on every chip they produce"", the report says. Collective operating losses are projected to hit a stunning $5 billion this year, it continues. 



Greg Roh, head of technology research at HMC Investment & Securities, added: ‚ÄúChip equipment companies‚Äô sales are plunging by around 30% to 50%. This is not a normal situation.""

‚ÄúThere will be pent-up demand for gadgets as well. Our view is that memory will recover in the second half,"" he added. 



Micron is planning on cutting its budge for new plants and is rushing to curb output. The company's Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra sid this week: ‚ÄúWe have to get through this cycle. I believe the trend of cross-cycle growth and profitability is still in place.‚Äù

Just last week, Intel reported terrible earnings and catastrophic guidance as well. As shown below, at the low end of the forecast range, Intel‚Äôs revenue would be the smallest quarterly total since 2010.



The outlook reflects the myriad challenges facing Intel, which was attempting to stage a comeback even before the market for personal-computer chips ‚Äî its main source of revenue ‚Äî fell into a slump. To get back on track, the company needs computer makers to quickly work through inventory stockpiles and return to ordering components. That would provide Intel with a revenue boost needed to help shore up its finances, which were already stretched by ambitious plans to regain technological leadership within the chip industry.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen extraordinary measures within the memory market. It‚Äôs at levels that we haven‚Äôt seen in 25 years,‚Äù said Lam CEO Tim Archer. 

Shin Jinho, co-CEO of Midas International Asset Management added: ‚ÄúThe NAND market is experiencing fierce competition and the recovery will follow one quarter after the DRAM market recovery. If the situation gets longer, eventually, we are going to see consolidation in the NAND market.‚Äù

All eyes are now on Samsung, Bloomberg says. It'll report on Tuesday this week and will offer additional color on the sector on its conference call.

            Authored by Michael Msika, Bloomberg,

The turmoil around Credit Suisse is gripping traders‚Äô attention just days after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. For investors holding bank shares, today‚Äôs European Central Bank meeting will be a test case for whether monetary authorities hold the line with interest rate hikes, even in the face of financial sector stress.

The Credit Suisse crisis and Wednesday‚Äôs rout across European bank shares mean the ECB can‚Äôt dismiss the downfall of SVB and two other US lenders as a transatlantic problem. The Swiss lender‚Äôs problems are long standing, but there is no denying that bond market volatility, relentless rate rises and the threat of economic recession can lead to severe financial sector stress.

Authorities will have watched with alarm as the Stoxx 600 Banks Index, Europe‚Äôs best-performing sector at the start of March, erased most of its year-to-date gains in the space of a few days.

Credit Default Swaps, a barometer of risk, are on the rise.

The question for the ECB is whether the shakeout is merely that ‚Äî a shakeout ‚Äî or a sign of real trouble.

BNP Paribas strategist Ankit Gheedia describes the selloff as a sort of ‚Äúcapitulation moment‚Äù for European banks, exacerbated by crowded long positions in the sector.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early to say if the bull case for banks is behind us or not, but clearly price action is concerning, and seeming like it would need some external support from regulators,‚Äù Gheedia adds. 


Positioning was indeed very extended. JPMorgan European derivatives strategist Davide Silvestrini points out that net long positions in Euro Stoxx banks‚Äô futures surpassed ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.2 billion) before this week‚Äôs selloff, near the highest since the Ukraine war erupted a year ago. Bullish option trades had also accumulated, hence the ‚Äúoverreaction,‚Äù Silvestrini says.



Many reckon that with euro area inflation running at 8.5%, the ECB will look through the turmoil and deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike.

After all, its chief Christine Lagarde recently described inflation as a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù that must be slain, a view reinforced by this week‚Äôs above-forecast US price data.

The US print showed further rate hikes are needed, but this risks more financial stability stress, says Evgenia Molotova, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management.


‚ÄúHence we might end up with either recession, if the rate hikes continue, or entrenched inflation if they don‚Äôt. It is very relevant for Europe as well as US.‚Äù




One crucial point though, is that the surge in credit default swaps on Credit Suisse has not triggered panic about other large banks, though their CDS too have risen. European bank shares trade at cheap valuations and are seen as more tightly regulated than US peers. The heightened scrutiny of banks for balance-sheet mismatches is also a positive, investors say.


‚ÄúWe remain bullish on European banks, the investment case on fast growing net interest margins is still intact,‚Äù said Fabio Caldato, a partner at Olympia Wealth Management, who is keen to invest in the sector. 

‚ÄúRegulations matter and European rules are luckily conservative.‚Äù


However, recession worries are already driving investors out of growth-sensitive cyclical shares such as autos, banks and retailers, a possibility this column had flagged at the end of February. Instead, defensive sectors such as food and pharma are back in favor.

John Leiper, CIO at Titan Asset Management, is among those taking a defensive stance. ‚ÄúWe are now starting to see the impact of prior tightening starting to bite,‚Äù Leiper says. ‚ÄúWe remain concerned that these ripple effects will continue to spread across the economy.‚Äù

The market reaction was the latest sign of unease among investors as they examine how banks performed during one of the most tumultuous periods for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis. Banks of all sizes will be scrambling over the coming weeks to show they survived the chaos of the first quarter and are better positioned than rivals to weather any future turmoil.

State Street was not the only large bank in focus Monday. The stock of Charles Schwab (SCHW) initially fell 3% after it said it lost $41 billion in deposits in the first three months of 2023. The stock of a regional lender based in Buffalo, M&T (MTB), was initially down as much as 1.6% after it said net interest income and deposits dropped during the first quarter.

By 11:20 AM, M&T and Schwab were both up more than 2%. State Street's stock, on the other hand, was down 11%.

What is clear so far from the results is that net interest income‚Äîa key measure of profitability that shows the difference between what a bank earns on its assets and pays out to depositors‚Äîis emerging a key focus of this earnings season as investors fret about the future profitability of the industry.

The concern is that banks will have to pay more for deposits as interest rates rise and competition for customers intensifies, thereby reducing their margins. Depositors over the last year have been moving their money to higher-yielding options at money market funds, and those outflows only accelerated in March following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.

Such a shift impacted State Street during the first quarter. Its net interest income was down 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, and its deposits fell by 5%. Flows into its money market funds increased.

The drop in net interest income was primarily due to lower balances of non-interest bearing deposits, a form of free funding where State Street pays no interest to customers. Those deposits fell to $39 billion from $44 billion.

State Street Chief Financial Officer Eric Aboaf told analysts he expects those deposits to drop by another $4-$5 billion in the second quarter before there is ""some stabilization"" and that that each drop of $1 billion costs the company $12-$15 million. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in a worst-case scenario these deposits could fall to $30 billion, costing the company $200 million.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre calculating the worst case, I think you‚Äôre math roughly is correct. We‚Äôre doing all we can to avoid the worst case,‚Äù said CEO Ron O‚ÄôHanley. And, he noted, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing that approaches a liquidity issue.""

State Street's total fourth-quarter income of $549 million was down 9% from a year ago and 25% from the fourth quarter. Its earnings were worse than analysts expected. Assets under management in its investment division also dropped, and its fee revenue was down 1% from the fourth quarter and 9% from the year-ago quarter.

The results from Charles Schwab offered another look at how a firm at the center of last month‚Äôs banking crisis performed. Investors punished Schwab following the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank as they looked for other institutions that could face an outflow of depositors or had sizable paper losses on their debt securities due to rising interest rates. Its stock dropped more than 30% in March.

The concern was that Schwab‚Äôs bank clients might move their money from ‚Äúsweep accounts‚Äù into higher-yielding alternatives, and that could force the company to sell some of its bonds at a loss.

During the peak of the turmoil in March, Schwab felt compelled to come out publicly and reassure investors its liquidity remained strong. Its CEO Walt Bettinger told The Wall Street Journal the brokerage could continue to operate even if it lost most of its deposits over the next year ‚Äúwithout having to sell a single security.‚Äù

On Monday he told analysts: ‚ÄúI would certainly hope that by this point in time, the short term driven speculation that we would find ourselves in a position where we would be forced to sell securities that have temporary paper losses has been put to bed.""

Schwab ended the first quarter with $325 billion in deposits. That was down 11% from the fourth quarter and 30% from the year-ago quarter. But it was also roughly what analysts expected.

The brokerage giant also said first-quarter profit of $1.6 billion and revenue of $5.1 billion were down when compared to the fourth quarter but up from the first quarter of 2022.

Target‚Äôs inventory loss, called shrink, totaled about $763 million last fiscal year, based on calculations from the company‚Äôs financial filings. With the anticipated increase, shrink this year would surpass $1 billion.

It can be difficult to quantify theft, since shrink includes inventory loss from other causes, such as employee theft or damage, too.

CEO Brian Cornell called out the challenge on the company‚Äôs fiscal first-quarter earnings call, saying the retailer and others are grappling with rising theft on top of slower sales and more price-sensitive shoppers. He described retail theft as ‚Äúa worsening trend that emerged last year,‚Äù and said violent incidents have increased at Target‚Äôs stores.

‚ÄúThe problem affects all of us, limiting product availability, creating a less convenient shopping experience, and putting our team and guests in harm‚Äôs way,‚Äù he said on the call.

Organized retail crime has become a hot-button issue in the industry, and some companies have blamed the growth of online marketplaces that allow thieves to anonymously sell electronics, makeup and other items they stole from stores. Home Depot, Walmart, Best Buy, Walgreens and CVS are among the major retailers that have spoken about the problem, saying that shrink has gotten worse.

‚ÄúThe country has a retail theft problem,‚Äù Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on a call with CNBC on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident in our ability to mitigate and blunt that pressure, but that pressure certainly exists out there.‚Äù

Yet it‚Äôs hard to verify if organized retail theft has grown and if so, by how much. Shrink cost retailers $94.5 billion in 2021, up from $90.8 billion in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. Its data is anonymized and shared by retailers, so it cannot be fact-checked.

External retail crime accounts for only 37% of those losses, or about $35 billion, the NRF data shows.

There are other caveats. COVID-19 fears and pandemic-related temporary store closures disrupted 2020, potentially tamping down foot traffic for both shoppers and thieves. Plus, shrink comes not just from shoplifting and employee theft, but from damaged products such as dinged furniture and expired food.

Target has become more vocal about organized retail theft, as it has struggled with excess inventory and its margins have disappointed. It missed Wall Street‚Äôs earnings expectations for three consecutive quarters last year. Unwanted merchandise sat around in its stores and warehouses, before the company took aggressive action to cancel orders and mark items down.

Cornell, however, has stressed that more theft is the driving Target‚Äôs worsening shrink.

Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said on the company‚Äôs investor call Wednesday that shrink reduced the company‚Äôs gross margin rate in the fiscal first quarter by a full percentage point compared with a year ago.

Cornell said Target is trying to reduce theft by installing protective fixtures and adjusting assortment in some stores. He said the company is working with politicians, law enforcement and retail industry trade groups to come up with policy solutions.

Some retailers and trade organizations pushed for the INFORM Consumers Act, a law that‚Äôs intended to require verification so thieves can‚Äôt easily sell stolen or counterfeit goods through online marketplaces. It was included in Congress‚Äô omnibus spending package late last year and relies on enforcement by state attorneys general.

Cornell said the company is ‚Äúfocused on keeping our stores open in the markets where problems are occurring.‚Äù It has roughly 1,900 stores across the country, which are located in suburban areas and major cities including New York City and San Francisco.

The big picture: Price volatility is the new normal ‚Äî at least when it comes to electric vehicles ‚Äî as automakers face intensifying competition while responding to commodity costs and other economic factors.
‚Ä¢ ""You have more extreme forces at play than you usually have ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs inflation, interest rates, government incentives and the price of materials that go into the production of a car, like lithium and nickel and palladium,"" iSeeCars.com analyst Karl Brauer tells Axios.

Why it matters: Dramatic price fluctuation increases the importance of purchase timing as some customers will pay more than others for the same vehicle.

How it (usually) works: Traditionally, automakers suggest a retail price for dealers, who then have the option of applying incentives to juice sales or, as has happened more recently, selling vehicles for above the MSRP.
‚Ä¢ Although prices certainly vary somewhat depending on the time of year, it's not normal for prices to change by thousands of dollars from one day to the next.

But EVs are charting a new path:
‚Ä¢ Tesla has cut prices several times this year ‚Äî with prices now down about 10% to 15% depending on the vehicle, Bank of America analyst John Murphy estimated.
‚Ä¢ Ford cut the price of the Mustang Mach-E earlier this year in response to Tesla price cuts, while it's raised the starting price of its F-150 Lightning more than $15,000 above its initial level.

At the same time, the types of vehicles that qualify for full or partial federal EV tax credits has changed again after the federal government recently delivered its verdict on qualifying standards.

Between the lines: Recent drops in the price of lithium have made EV manufacturing cheaper, while overall inflation continues to ease up.

What they're saying: ""It just feels like there are more external circumstances that can impact a car‚Äôs cost to produce than there probably have ever been before,"" Brauer says.

The impact: For automakers, sudden price changes can jolt sales, boost profits, both or neither. It depends on how customers react.
‚Ä¢ Analysts have credited Tesla's price cuts with boosting demand, but at the expense of the company's gross profit margin ‚Äî which hit its lowest level in the most recent quarter since the last quarter of 2020.
‚Ä¢ ""With no rose colored glasses: margins are now a delicate issue that are keeping Tesla investors up at night,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote Thursday.

As we detailed earlier, Credit Suisse Group AG's shares reached their lowest point ever, dropping by as much as 10%. This is the eighth consecutive session of decline, which comes in the wake of restructuring issues, delays in submitting its annual report due to 'material weakness' flagged by the SEC last week, and a broader industry selloff following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In addition to these challenges, the troubled Swiss bank now faces a new problem: its top shareholder has said they will not invest any further due to the sharp decline in valuations.

""The answer is absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory,"" Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Wednesday.

That was in response to a question about whether Credit Suisse would receive fresh injections if another liquidity crisis emerged. 

Saudi National Bank, which is 37% owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, is Credit Suisse's largest shareholder as of late 2022 after acquiring a 9.9% stake. Al Khudairy said there are no plans at the moment to take the stake over the 10% threshold because of regulatory hurdles. In the last several months, since the bank's equity has been on a waterfall lower, the Saudis have lost more than 500 million francs on their position. 

The news the Saudis are perhaps done supporting the troubled Swiss bank sent shares down as much as 25% to a new record low in Zurich. 



Putting that new record low in context... down over 98% from the 2000 highs. The red area is post-Greensill debacle...



Bear in mind that CD remains a SIFI, prompting systemic risk fears and has led to the cost of insuring the bank's bonds against default in the near term to distressed levels. 


""One-year credit default swaps for the embattled Swiss lender were indicated at 835.9 basis points on Tuesday's close of business, based on pricing source CMAQ. Other pricing sources point to a further rise on Wednesday, while a level of 1,000 would indicate serious concern,"" Bloomberg said. 




Five-year credit default swaps have widened the most ever -- indicating the restructuring of the bank and the hope to bring it back to profitability might be unattainable at the moment as a banking crisis triggered by SVB sparks contagion. 



Also today, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann stated the bank isn't considering government aid and that it would be inaccurate to draw parallels between its current difficulties and the collapse of SVB. 


""We have strong capital ratios, a strong balance sheet,"" Lehmann said. 

""We already took the medicine,"" he said, referring to the restructuring program announced in late 2022. 


Barclays told clients this morning that the outlook for European banks remains uncertain in the short term, citing ""too-difficult-to-predict"" risks and the restrictive pathway of monetary policy.

Kroger has adopted an omnichannel strategy, integration of offline or in-store sales with online orders and logistics. It's a concept that originated in China in 2016 when founder Jack Ma of e-commerce giant Alibaba coined the term ""New Retail"" and proceeded to open 300 high-tech Freshippo-branded supermarkets in 27 Chinese cities. This ""New Retail"" model has been ""cut and pasted from businesses that worked in China,"" said Michael Zakkour, founder of digital commerce and retail consultancy 5 New Digital in New York. ""We are seeing it with Kroger, Target and Walmart. They looked at the New Retail model born in China for complete integration of offline and online channels,"" he said. ""Same-day delivery, restaurants in store, app-driven sales and QR codes are all bright spots in every single one of them, and all happened first in China."" At first, the highly competitive and fragmented U.S. food retailing business was slow to catch on. But the action was jumpstarted when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market in 2017 and began introducing several advanced technologies to streamline in-store shopping, a shift that also spread to large retailers Walmart and Target. ""You just can't be a 1990s grocer. You have to be courageous, break things, and quickly adapt,"" said Yael Cosset, senior vice president and chief information officer at Kroger, who is leading its tech and digital initiatives. In a nod to Alibaba, he said the Chinese e-commerce company ""has done a fantastic job in reinventing the retail model, a convergence of brick and mortar with e-commerce in an online and offline world.""

Cosset has been spearheading introduction of the omnichannel shopping experience. Kroger's new retailing links together shopping, e-commerce and logistics: automated fulfillment centers bag groceries; vans make same-day deliveries to households; data analytics provide an early read on customer trends; mobile apps distribute customer promotions and coupons; on-premise ""ghost kitchens"" prepare meals for in-store pickup or van delivery; QR codes handle payments online at self check-outs; and large online fulfillment centers and warehouses rely on robots for packing, sorting and loading orders. New automated fulfillment centers are a critical part of the technology effort. These centers use AI and robotics to replace labor-intensive work of sorting and bagging groceries for delivery, while on-site employees handle such operations as engineering and inventory management. ""When you look at retail, there are two big enablers: tech and data science, and secondly, supply chain logistics and fulfillment,"" Zakkour said. ""The lesson that American retailers are learning is that their operations can be more efficient with higher margins when retail and e-commerce are seamlessly integrated."" Zakkour credited Kroger for being one of the more progressive U.S. retailers in implementing this omnichannel approach. Competitors Walmart and Target are spending heavily, even in a slowing economy, and with technology a focus among current capex investments. ""A company that doesn't have a laser beam focus on tech that Kroger does is vulnerable,"" said Jim Russell, principal at investment firm Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati. ""These digital trends continue to roll forward, and Kroger is delivering very strong results in the pandemic and post-pandemic period.""

Digital grocery shopping took off during Covid, as customers favored e-commerce, eating at home, and prepared meals. Kroger's digital business scaled to more than $10 billion in 2020, and has grown by 113 percent during the past two years. Building on this momentum, Kroger aims to double its digital revenues by the end of 2023. Kroger digital sales gained by 8 percent in the second quarter of 2022, while in-store and online combined gained 5.8 percent from a year earlier. Supermarkets had been lagging other sectors in e-commerce with three to four percent of total sales but tripled during the pandemic, according to McKinsey, which predicts that e-commerce will represent 18 percent of supermarket sales within the next three to five years. ""We are finding out now how well this digital shift is working at Kroger,"" Russell said. He pointed out that ""half of Kroger's app stores are bringing in incremental business and half are cannibalizing in-store sales."" Total company sales rose 4.1 percent in 2021 to $137.9 billion, and Kroger is expecting a gain in the range of 4 percent to 4.5 percent for 2022.

Under a Restock Kroger initiative begun five years ago, the grocer combined physical and digital experiences, a strategy that has required major, long-term investment in robotics and supply chain management, as well as data analytics to understand and predict customer habits, and to personalize marketing. ""We are leveraging data to engage with customers through digital channels such as apps and web site logins to make the customer interactions relevant, and bring to life personalized shopping experiences,"" Cosset said. He pointed out that large stores can lose the personal connection with customers that a local shop provides. But by using data and technology, Kroger can link better to customers and personalize ads and promotions online. Cosset joined Kroger in 2015 when the grocery chain acquired the U.S. assets of its partner, London-based data science company dunnhumby, where he held leadership posts. Kroger created 84.51¬∞ as a new business out of dunnhumbyUSA, serving Kroger and other clients including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Tesco.

Thousands of third-party sellers who ship products themselves will start paying a 2% fee on each sale in October, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. That‚Äôs on top of the commission ‚Äî usually 15% ‚Äî that merchants already pay Amazon to sell products on the popular web store.

Several merchants interviewed by Bloomberg interpreted the new fee as an attempt to pressure them into using Amazon‚Äôs logistics services rather than fulfilling orders themselves. The company didn‚Äôt explain to sellers why the levy was required, but told Bloomberg it will help cover the costs of running a separate infrastructure and measuring its effectiveness.

Amazon has been accused of having too much power over the some 2 million merchants who use its platform, which captures about 37.6% of all online spending in the US, according to Insider Intelligence, or about six times more than its closest online competitor Walmart Inc. The Federal Trade Commission is in the final stages of preparing an antitrust case against Amazon, and the timing of the new fee took some merchants and consultants by surprise.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting here waiting for the FTC to take action against Amazon for antitrust issues, and this fee shows Amazon is not scared at all,‚Äù said Jason Boyce, whose Avenue7Media helps about 100 businesses sell products online.

In recent years, Amazon has been ratcheting up fees on merchants, who typically pay for advertising and logistics to help maximize their sales. The business has become increasingly important to the company as sales growth in the core online operation slows. Seller services generated $32.3 billion in the second quarter, up 18% from the same period a year earlier and more than the profitable cloud services business. Last year, for the first time, seller fees began gobbling up about half the cost of each sale, making it harder for merchants to make a profit.

The new fee targets merchants who use Seller Fulfilled Prime, a service that lets them handle logistics themselves and still get an Amazon Prime badge, which lets customers know they can expect quick delivery. These merchants often sell bulkier items such as furniture that don‚Äôt mesh well with Amazon‚Äôs highly automated warehouses, which are designed to mostly handle smaller products.

Amazon launched Seller Fulfilled Prime in 2015 as a way to expand inventory without overloading its fulfillment centers. It closed enrollment in the program a few years later saying merchants were having difficulty meeting Amazon‚Äôs delivery standards. Amazon in June announced it would again open enrollment for Seller Fulfilled Prime, a move the company saw as a way to appease regulators investigating it for antitrust issues, according to people familiar with the matter.

Amazon informed merchants about the new fee last week.

One office furniture merchant enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime said the fee will cost his company approximately $1 million a year, forcing it to raise prices. He will probably continue to use the service because Amazon has so many customers but notes that he‚Äôs not getting anything extra in return for paying the fee.

Another merchant also expected to raise prices to cover the new fee and said that, for many merchants using the service, the 2% levy will wipe out as much as one-third of already meager profit margins. He also said Amazon only gave sellers a few weeks notice, making it difficult to adjust because inventory had already been ordered for the busy holiday shopping season.

Both sellers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon.

‚ÄúWe are excited to offer Seller Fulfilled Prime to sellers as a way to independently handle fulfillment of their products while also making those products available to Prime customers with fast, free delivery, great customer service and free returns,‚Äù Amazon spokesperson Jonathon Hillson said.

Amazon‚Äôs seller fees have been a focus of regulators and lawmakers since at least 2019, when a merchant accused Amazon of using its dominance in e-commerce to force sellers to use its logistics services. The allegation, since echoed by multiple sellers, has emerged as a focus of the FTC‚Äôs antitrust case against Amazon, according to people familiar with the situation.

Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive officer of Marketplace Pulse, which monitors online sales, says Amazon has been making it harder and harder in recent years for merchants to qualify for Seller Fulfilled Prime. The upshot: ‚ÄúMost sellers use Fulfillment By Amazon instead.‚Äù",Singapore Receives Six Applications for Presidential Election,non-causal,"FTC, US",['US'],[],"['FTC', 'US']","['AMZN', 'FTC', 'US']",-0.9998073

However, the annual profit that Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE: DRI) forecasted was largely below what Wall Street had expected with a clear warning of a slowdown in fine dining that is getting beaten by fast food chains like McDonalds Corporation (NYSE: MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Before its earnings report, the stock had been approaching its all-time high of $168.98 that was set on June 15th, but ended up falling more than 3% in morning trading.

During the quarter that ended on May 28th, revenue rose 6.4% as it amounted to $2.77 billion with LongHorn Steakhouse's same-store sales growing 7.1% while Olive Garden followed with 4.4%. While Olive Garden, who makes up about 45% of sales fell short of Street Account's 5% estimate, LongHorn Steakhouse exceeded expectations big time as StreetAccount expected 4.9%. The underperformer was the fine dining segment whose same-store sales dropped 1.9%.

Results did not include Darden's $715 million purchase of Ruth‚Äôs Chris Steak House that was completed on June 14th. Labor inflation amounted to about 6% and dented margins, but also helped boost employee retention and improve service. Net income amounted to $315.1 million, or $2.58 per share, rising from last year's comparable quarter when it amounted to $281.7 million, or $2.24 per share.

Orlando, Florida-based restaurant chain guided for full-year profit in the range between $8.55 per share and $8.85 per share with same-store sales growing from 2.5% to 3.5%. CFO Raj Vennam announced that menu prices will rise by 3.5% to 4% due to rising costs, particularly for labor, and therefore traffic for the year will likely be flat to 1.5% lower.

Darden guided for net sales between $11.5 billion and $11.6 billion, with same-store sales growth between 2.5% and 3.5%. Along with capital spending of $550 million to $600 million and total inflation of 3% to 4%, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected between $8.55 and $8.85.

Softer fine-dining sales are expected through the undergoing, fiscal first quarter but according to the CFO Raj Vennam, traffic will stabilize on a YoY basis afterwards.

As for the fine dining chains, it is important to note that during last year's comparable quarter, customers were going out to celebrate the departure of Omicron. Moreover, traffic at Darden's fine dining restaurants has more than doubled over the last three quarters when compared to 2019 levels. However, the chain observed the weakened demand for alcoholic beverages, while fine dining fell only for lower-income and younger age groups, while they flattened for higher income and older age groups. In both cases, the trends suggest a degree of price sensitivity, as CEO Ricardo Cardena concluded.

Even Darden's rival Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ: TXRH) is losing market share to fast-food chains such as McDonalds and Chipotle who are dominating the field. But Cardenas remains hopeful, as despite consumers prioritizing affordability in times of economic tension, they also go for the value and the experience. Yet, the latest reports do show that fast food chains like McDonalds and Chipotle,who are showing remarkable revenue and profit trends, are gobbling up restaurants who offer a full-service dining experience. From an investor perspective, there's a lot to like from McDonalds as it began 2023 by posting strong sales on top of last year's gains. Moreover, McDonalds is accelerating its gains and was even ahead of Chipotle in late April, comparable-store sales at McDonalds rose 13% in the quarter, while Chipotle experienced an 11% comps increase during its first quarter. McDonalds achieved a double win as it increased customer traffic while also raising prices. McDonalds is also a leader in the operating margin arena with its margin rising above 45% of sales, improving further from 2022's 40.4%. Although McDonalds gets to profit from its franchises through fees and royalty charges, its business momentum is all about the menu items and that 'something' customers like about its restaurants. Therefore, the concept of 'value and experience' is a topic to be explored in detail from the aspect of consumer behavior during challenging times as fast food chains seem to have that 'something' that consumers especially treasure when times are hard as otherwise, higher menu items would put them off.

In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Jim Farley boiled it all down to one theme: vertical integration. Much like Henry Ford sought out self-sufficiency and wanted to source and steer all the resources he needed to produce automobiles, Farley sees value in reversing decades of outsourcing and doing more in-house.

Here are highlights from Farley‚Äôs conversation with Bloomberg TV‚Äôs Matt Miller, edited for length and clarity:

You‚Äôve said you wanted to take out $2.5 billion of cost this year, and have a structural cost disadvantage that Ford needed to work on. How‚Äôs that going?

We‚Äôre making progress. It needs to go faster, but a new culture is setting in in the company.

A lot of other competitors have made a lot of personnel reductions. What we want to reduce is more like the bill of material costs, the industrial costs in the plants, a lot of extra inventory, as well as our negotiated costs with the suppliers. Our cost we want to get out is actually in the heart of our industrial system, it‚Äôs not just people.

How much do you think vehicle prices are going to come down, and what‚Äôs going to drive that?

We‚Äôre assuming, in our plan this year and next year, five-plus percent reductions. It‚Äôs kind of in between where we were in 2019 and where we‚Äôve been.

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to go back to the days a couple years ago of 100 days‚Äô supply. Some are in the 50 days‚Äô supply range.

You‚Äôre starting to see now low APRs from a lot of brands that have older product. What‚Äôs unique about Ford is we have an all-new lineup. But the background pricing will be more difficult.

Ford is targeting an 8% profit margin for its EV business by late 2026. Will you get up to Tesla‚Äôs level, or will they come down to you?

Both are going to happen. Tesla has had the market to themselves, they had a big head start, and now they‚Äôre seeing a lot more pressure. We‚Äôre going to see that, especially in the two-row crossover. We think there will be like 50 to 100 new models, and a lot of people want to grow, so it‚Äôs going to be a great time to buy a two-row electric EV like the Mustang Mach-E.

Where we compete in electric pickup trucks, three-row crossovers that we‚Äôre going to show people today, and the electric commercial vehicles, we don‚Äôt see as much price competition because there aren‚Äôt as many choices there, and we‚Äôve seen that on the F-150 Lightning. The price of the Lightning has increased mightily over the last two years, while the Mustang Mach-E has been more competitive.

What we have to do as a company is reduce the bill of material cost. So on Mustang Mach-E, we‚Äôve gotten the cost of the vehicle down $5,000 this year. We‚Äôre going to need to do the same thing, and even faster, on our second-generation product.

You pushed through with plans to license CATL technology for a battery factory in Michigan, and it seemed from that you‚Äôre not afraid of the political pressure with regard to China. How do you see that in the longer term?

The Inflation Reduction Act was a game-changer for companies like Ford. Tesla has been importing CATL batteries for a long time, and we don‚Äôt really want to import them. We‚Äôd rather build them, and not just in Mexico, but here in the US.

The company has great LFP technology. That‚Äôs a really affordable battery, it also has twice the charge cycles that are great for our commercial customers.

It‚Äôs a Ford factory, it‚Äôs Ford workers, Ford is building the factory. It‚Äôs the right kind of structure of a deal for the IRA, to build 3,000 or 4,000 jobs in the US, instead of importing.

You announced a series of lithium partnerships today. How difficult is it going to be get all of the battery materials you‚Äôre going to need?

What we‚Äôve learned hiring a lot of new talent into the company is that the mining part is not the constraint. It‚Äôs really the processing, so turning those raw materials ‚Äî especially lithium and nickel ‚Äî into processed materials we can put as a slurry to make the cells.

That processing is a limiting factor. You can lock up all the mining capacity ‚Äî which we‚Äôve pretty much done for 2 million EVs ‚Äî and the pricing pressure with that, given that it‚Äôs limited, is always going to be there. But what people need to understand, it‚Äôs onshoring the processing that‚Äôs going to be the most important controller of costs, and also politics.

Eighty percent of the processing for nickel and lithium are being done in China, and we need to localize that in FTA countries or in North America.

How vertical will you go in terms of building the batteries, processing the material, mining it?

We‚Äôre going back to kind of where we started as a company in the 1920s, when Henry Ford built the Rouge, and everyone kind of copied the Rouge. We are definitely going much deeper in vertical integration.

Batteries, we‚Äôre going to have our own plant and our own labor here in Michigan. That will be a big lesson learned. What we‚Äôve found on batteries on the manufacturing side, scaling for quality is a lot harder than we thought. Actually building the buildings, getting the raw material, processing is difficult, but the hardest thing we‚Äôve found is to build, at scale, quality batteries.

Vertical integration is going to be the theme of the day, because the gearboxes, the electric motors, the inverters, the whole electrical architecture, we farmed out to all of our suppliers for decades. We‚Äôre bringing all that in now, inside the company. It‚Äôs hard, but it helps with the costs, and we think all those are difference-makers.

We want to be doing those things and solving the hardest problems at Ford.
