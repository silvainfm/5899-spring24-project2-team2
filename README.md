# Project Summary
We aimed to construct a long/short portfolio by leveraging sentiment analysis from various models, including GPT, BERT, and FinBERT. Given the suboptimal accuracy of most models, we opted to use a BERT model fined tuned on financial news. While training these models, we integrated the Yahoo Finance API to gather stock information for our specified tickers. Once sentiment analysis was obtained for the articles, we devised a strategy to buy or sell stocks based on sentiment and its corresponding score. Initially planning to utilize the AlphaLens package for backtesting and portfolio construction. We were able to use the alpha lens reloaded package.
